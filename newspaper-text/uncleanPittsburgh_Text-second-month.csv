By
      
        Claudia Koerner Posted on November 26, 2018, at 11:13 p.m. ET Returning to the set of daytime talk show The Real for the first time since her niece's death in this month's mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, host Tamera Mowry-Housley made an emotional plea to end gun violence, describing the late 18-year-old as a ""debater"" who ""would want me to debate that."" Alaina Housley, a student at Pepperdine University, was killed earlier this month at the Borderline Bar & Grill, a country music bar frequented by students and locals in Thousand Oaks, California. Eleven others, including fellow country music fans, students, bar employees, and a sheriff's deputy, were also killed, and the gunman was found dead at the scene. On Monday, Mowry-Housley's voice shook with emotion as she described the teen, whom she said she thought of as a little sister. As she remembered her niece, Mowry-Housely said Alaina would want her aunt to be talking about an issue like gun violence. ""We need change when it comes to gun violence,"" the former Sister Sister actor said. ""And I don't care if I have to knock on the doors of the White House to do it, to advocate change. Alaina was very sweet, and loving, and kind. She was also a debater, so she would want me to debate that."" Alaina Housley Mowry-Housley added that she is still in the process of grieving, but believed it was important for her to move forward in honor of her niece. ""I don't like to say move on because I don't think I'll ever move on with the fact that she's not here with me or with our family,"" Mowry-Housley said, a tear running down her face. ""But she would want me to move forward and to use her voice as a catalyst for change. And that's why I'm here today."" She described gun violence as a disease afflicting the US and said that people needed to come together for it to heal. ""We're so divided,"" she said. ""We should never have to fight for the safety of our children. We should never have to fight for that. That should just happen out of your heart, out of human decency."" And the talk show host called on viewers to get involved as well. ""I feel that if we talk to our representatives, and talk from that place, maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to move forward,"" she said. ""And if it's up to me, I'm going to make sure that happens."" After the show, Mowry-Housley said on Instagram that she had been nervous to speak out, but believed that her niece had given her the strength to do so. ""I truly believe she helped me today.""

A passerby stops to look over a street side memorial to the shooting victims of the Borderline Bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif. on Tuesday, Nov. 27, 2018. Investigators said Tuesday that the number of victims from a shooting at a country music bar in Southern California this month could have been much higher based on the amount of ammunition the gunman carried. (AP Photo/Amanda Lee Myers) THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. – The gunman who killed 12 people in a crowded Southern California bar had more than 150 bullets left to fire but stopped shooting to ambush arriving officers, killing one of them, police said Tuesday. Investigators said they still don't know why 28-year-old Ian David Long attacked staff and customers at the Borderline Bar and Grill in the Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks on Nov. 7. There's no evidence that Long was radicalized or was targeting anyone at the bar, and though Long had previously been a customer there, the owner didn't know him, investigators said. They painted a clearer picture of the chaos that ensued when Long opened fire as a crowd of people mostly in their 20s danced to country music. Long threw smoke grenades into the group of revelers, obstructing what they could see. He used a flashlight with a laser sight attached to his .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol as he fired, killing 12 of the 13 people who were struck. He stabbed one of the shooting victims in the neck, though it was unclear why, a coroner's official said. Some people laid on top of friends to protect them as the bullets flew while others frantically busted out the windows of the bar to escape. ""As you can imagine, this was a terrifying experience for everyone who was there,"" Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said. ""Confusion and chaos can only begin to adequately describe the situation."" The first two officers to arrive at the scene, sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus and a highway patrolman, saw at least 100 people fleeing the bar and ran into an ambush, Ayub said. Long had gotten into a tactical position and fired on them when they entered, killing Helus, a 29-year veteran of the department who was close to retirement. Initial reports from survivors spread further confusion. Some of those who were injured in the escape fled to a nearby bar and authorities at first feared that a separate shooting had occurred there. Survivors also gave different descriptions of the shooter, leading officers to believe there was more than one gunman. Long, who was not hit by the officers' gunfire, fatally shot himself. The former machine gunner and Afghanistan war veteran posted on social media during a break in the gunfire that he wondered if people would think he was insane. He had the capability to kill many more than 12 people. Of seven 30-round high-capacity magazines that Long had, five remained unused, Ayub said. Such magazines are illegal to buy and possess in California but can easily be purchased in neighboring states. The mother of one of the victims, Telemachus ""Tel"" Orfanos, said she went to the news conference to make sure her son was remembered as more than a statistic. Susan Schmidt-Orfanos said she was putting her energy into working for gun-control measures. Her son had survived the mass shooting last year in Las Vegas before being killed at Borderline. ""There's no place to put my anger,"" she said. ""We need to end gun violence so that no other families grieve and are shattered as we are shattered. That's where my rage is going to go."" Investigators have interviewed hundreds of witnesses and gathered bullet casings, surveillance video and other evidence from the scene, as well as seized items from Long's home, including digital media, said Paul Delacourt, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. Most of the evidence taken by the FBI is being analyzed at its lab in Quantico, Virginia. Detectives hope items from the house help them learn why Long carried out the attack and that evidence from the bar better explains how he carried it out. ""There's a process of both interviewing the people and getting the information investigators obtain and consolidating those to develop a timeline, and if we can discover what the motivation was for this attack,"" Ventura County sheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian said. Their work persisted in spite of a wildfire that erupted just hours after the shooting, forcing some FBI investigators and sheriff's detectives to evacuate. ""They didn't miss a beat,"" said Kuredjian. Neighbors have said Long made them uncomfortable and even called 911 on him in April. Responding deputies found Long behaving angrily and irrationally, but a mental health specialist who met with him didn't feel he needed to be hospitalized. Two of Long's former high school track coaches described his behavior during his teenage years as aggressive and disturbing. They told The Associated Press that they repeatedly complained about Long to school administrators, insisted that he needed help, and even kicked him off the team after he assaulted one of them. They say another coach reinstated Long after arguing that removing him could jeopardize his goal of joining the military. ___ Associated Press Writer Brian Melley contributed to this report from Los Angeles.

The Interface is a daily column and newsletter about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe here. On Saturday, the Observer published an article describing a rather incredible caper that took place in the United Kingdom. As part of an ongoing inquiry into fake news, Parliament seized a cache of documents obtained during legal discovery in a case mounted by an app developer against Facebook in an unrelated matter in the United States. Carole Cadwalladr, who rose to prominence this year as one of the journalists who broke the Cambridge Analytica story, has the tale: Damian Collins, the chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, invoked a rare parliamentary mechanism to compel the founder of a US software company, Six4Three, to hand over the documents during a business trip to London. In another exceptional move, parliament sent a serjeant at arms to his hotel with a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with its order. When the software firm founder failed to do so, it’s understood he was escorted to parliament. He was told he risked fines and even imprisonment if he didn’t hand over the documents. “We are in uncharted territory,” said Collins, who also chairs an inquiry into fake news. “This is an unprecedented move but it’s an unprecedented situation. We’ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest.” What, exactly, might be of interest here? In the Wall Street Journal, Deepa Seetharaman catches us up on Six4Three and why it’s suing Facebook: The Six4Three lawsuit stemmed from Facebook’s decision in 2014 to stop giving outside developers broad access to information about users’ friends. The move was a harsh blow to developers, forcing a number of apps to shut down, while Facebook argued it helped bolster user privacy. Six4Three was the developer of an app called Pikinis, which allowed its users to find photos of Facebook users in bathing suits. It ceased operation in 2015 because of Facebook’s decision to curtail access to its users’ data, according to the lawsuit. The 2014 changes were, of course, the ones designed to tamp down on the kind of invasive third-party data harvesting that would eventually come back to bite Facebook this year with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. What makes the seizure of documents strange is that so little of the Cambridge Analytica story is, at this late date, in dispute. We know what data was made available to third-party developers before 2014. We know Facebook gradually became uncomfortable with how these developers were exploiting its users. We know they deliberated about it internally and eventually shut off the spigot. Seetharaman suggests that it is these deliberations that are of interest to Collins. And perhaps some spicy emails will see the light of day. But it’s hard to square the facts of the case with the way the document cache is presented in the Observer, which is as a development somewhere on the level of the Pentagon Papers. And in any case, it remains unclear what 2014 data privacy discussions have to do with Collins’ inquiry, which is supposed to be investigating the impact of fake news. The inquiry, which began in 2017, produced an interim report in July. Perhaps the document cache will link data privacy and fake news. Or perhaps a politician is simply casting about looking for new cudgels with which to beat Facebook in front of television cameras. Collins’ committee will hold a public hearing on Tuesday, and may discuss the cache of documents then. (Mark Zuckerberg was invited to go, and declined.) But as we waited for those internal communications to become public, a new court filing introduced a rather amazing twist. Collins only got the documents because he was able to ascertain the hotel in which Ted Kramer, Six4Three’s managing director, was staying during a business trip to London. And who told him that? Ryan Mac has the story in BuzzFeed: Although Kramer concedes he does not know how the DCMS committee knew where he was staying in London, he suggests in a 19-page court filing made on Monday that Carole Cadwalladr, a freelance reporter at British outlet the Observer, had tipped off the committee to his hotel address so that it could obtain the documents. Kramer and his lawyers did not immediately respond to his request for comment. Cadwalladr also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Damian Collins declined to comment. […] The filing alleges that on November 17, 2018, during a phone conversation with Cadwalladr, Kramer told the reporter he would be on an unrelated business trip to London. According to the document, “she suggested they meet for her to receive another update on the case. Mr. Kramer agreed to meet with her at his hotel and sent her a calendar invitation with the address of the hotel.” Standards for journalistic ethics vary widely from country to country. In the United States, it would typically be frowned upon for a reporter to tip off a government body that a foreign national and source was coming to town and might be in possession of documents useful in an ongoing inquiry. At the very least, such an arrangement would require a prominent disclosure from the journalist were she ever to write about the seizure of those documents. In any case, it certainly seemed possible on Monday that the contents of the document cache would amount to less than the Observer suggested — and that the story of how Collins obtained it might amount to much more. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg Is Tainted by Crisis After Crisis Sarah Frier digs into the various ways Sandberg’s standing has been hurt by two years of perma-crisis. This story inadvertently triggered a daylong debate on Twitter after Frier, citing Facebook, reported that the company’s vaunted election war room had been shut down and replaced with a Friday-morning meeting. After I tweeted about it, Facebook’s Guy Rosen tweeted back that the war room not only wasn’t shutting down, but that it would expand. Then TechCrunch wrote about that. Anyway, my unpopular opinion is that the war room was probably useful and not (just!) a PR stunt, and I’m glad that the idea of a focused cross-functional teams sharing physical office space will endure into the future. My popular opinion is that Frier’s story good and that you should read it. Information Attacks against Democracies Bruce Schneier has a new paper out that is highly relevant to our interests here. Here’s a good, concise summary: Democracies, in contrast, are vulnerable to information attacks that turn common political knowledge into contested political knowledge. If people disagree on the results of an election, or whether a census process is accurate, then democracy suffers. Similarly, if people lose any sense of what the other perspectives in society are, who is real and who is not real, then the debate and argument that democracy thrives on will be degraded. This is what seems to be Russia’s aims in their information campaigns against the US: to weaken our collective trust in the institutions and systems that hold our country together. This is also the situation that writers like Adrien Chen and Peter Pomerantsevdescribe in today’s Russia, where no one knows which parties or voices are genuine, and which are puppets of the regime, creating general paranoia and despair. […] In other words, the same fake news techniques that benefit autocracies by making everyone unsure about political alternatives undermine democracies by making people question the common political systems that bind their society. Memo from a ‘Facebook nation’ to Mark Zuckerberg: You moved fast and broke our country. Kara Swisher interviews Maria Ressa, co-founder of the news site Rappler in the Philippines, who is facing 10 years in prison for honestly reporting on its authoritarian leader. She blames his rise, in part, on Facebook: RESSA: President Duterte, in his second state of the nation address, in July of 2017, singles us out, he doesn’t, he attacks the top television network but he singles us out and says, “This Rappler is foreign-owned or 100 percent owned by foreigners.” I couldn’t help myself, because we were live. I automatically tweeted about it, “Mr. President, you’re wrong.” I want my independence. This is part of the reason we set up Rappler. Then within a week the first investigations began. Then the cases came in. Russia accuses Google of failing to remove links to banned sites Russian state officials formally accused Google of breaking the law by not removing links to websites that are banned in the country, Colin Lecher reports: The potential penalty that Google could face is minuscule for a company of its size: officials said in the statement that the search giant could only face fines of up to 700,000 roubles, or about $10,000. But Reuters reports that the Russian government has been considering more drastic actions, including fining companies up to 1 percent of annual revenue for failing to comply with similar laws. Russia has passed a series of laws in recent years that give the government more power to censor the web, and has clashed with major websites like Wikipedia over the rules. Google tightens political ad policies ahead of 2019 EU elections Google has announced it will publicize the identity of organizations paying for political ads during the 2019 EU Parliamentary Elections, Jon Porter reports, in a move that could address Facebook’s dark money problem. Any ad that mentions a political party, candidate, or office holder will have to tell users who paid for it, with Google also introducing a new process to verify these identities. Google flouting EU competition ruling, say rival price comparison sites An EU ruling says Google has to give “equal treatment” to rival shopping sites. They’ve written a letter saying the company is not meeting that condition. YouTube Lets California Fire Conspiracy Theories Run Wild YouTube has gotten better about removing conspiracy theories from top search results, but Caroline Haskins finds a miss on the California wildfires: Currently, when a user starts typing “California fire” into YouTube, the top autocomplete search suggestions are “conspiracy 2018,” “agenda 21,” and “laser beam,” all of which refer to conspiracy theories related to California’s wildfires. Similarly, typing in “California wildfire” leads YouTube to suggest “lasers,” “directed energy weapon,” and “dew,” which is an acronym for “directed energy weapon.” Simply typing “California fire” and searching it does return straightforward news coverage, which is an improvement over, say, the false flag and crisis actor conspiracies YouTube was surfacing about the Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting earlier this year. Beijing to Judge Every Resident Based on Behavior by End of 2020 Beijing will adopt “a lifelong points program” by 2021, assigning individual ratings to each resident, Bloomberg reports in a chilling story: The capital city will pool data from several departments to reward and punish some 22 million citizens based on their actions and reputations by the end of 2020, according to a plan posted on the Beijing municipal government’s website on Monday. Those with better so-called social credit will get “green channel” benefits while those who violate laws will find life more difficult. The Beijing project will improve blacklist systems so that those deemed untrustworthy will be “unable to move even a single step,” according to the government’s plan. Xinhua reported on the proposal Tuesday, while the report posted on the municipal government’s website is dated July 18. America’s Elite Universities Are Censoring Themselves on China American universities have many Chinese students and increasingly get a lot of funding from China, and increasingly they are biting their tongues for fear of aggravating the Communist Party, Isaac Stone Fish reports: More often, the self-censorship is nuanced and difficult to detect. “You’re not going to get a lot of China specialists openly confessing that self-censorship is a big problem,” said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California who is known for his critical stance toward the Chinese Communist Party. And yet Pei believes that those who communicate to non-academic audiences, particularly in the media, thus increasing the likelihood that the Chinese government will see their work, and those who work on sensitive issues like Tibet, must watch what they say. “You don’t want to go out on a limb,” he said. “You want to come across as very measured.” Sounding “too strident,” he said, not only risks “the ire of the Chinese government but could also lose the respect of your peers, who value evidence above opinion.” Robert Barnett, who ran Columbia University’s Modern Tibetan Studies Program from its founding in 1999 until stepping down in 2017, emphasized that Columbia never actively restricted his work, but that there was often “a very strong tendency within the university, and with many prestigious institutions in the U.S., not to include people who study the kind of subject I work on in any kind of academic collaborations in China or in dialogues with Chinese delegates.” No Refuge for Investors as 2018 Rout Sends Stocks, Bonds, Oil Lower Tech stocks keep dropping. Akane Otani and Michael Wursthorn report: Twenty-six funds dumped their entire stakes in Facebook Inc. in the third quarter, according to a Goldman Sachs Group analysis of 13-F filings, including billionaire Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC, which offloaded 4 million shares, citing “a very disappointing quarter” for Facebook. It’s Easy To Blame Online Rhetoric For Violence. The Reality Is Much Harder. Joe Bernstein explores the cases of two far-right keyboard warriors in an effort to learn how much the online culture war can be blamed for real-world violence: The truth is, as researchers of violent extremism like James and Horgan will tell you, the vast majority of people who use Gab and Stormfront will never commit a violent crime. That’s not to absolve online communities of the beliefs of their members. It’s not to say digital spaces can’t play a major role in ushering people toward violence. As the lasting influence of Anwar al-Awlaki and Dylann Roof show, they can. It’s not even to say such spaces have a right to exist on private hosting services. They don’t — at least not as far as the First Amendment is concerned. But there isn’t an easy answer when it comes to finding the small number of people who will commit extremist violence. Internal Facebook memo sees outgoing VP of comms Schrage take blame for hiring Definers The newsletter was off when this story broke, and it seems like too much time has passed to really weigh in on it here now. The key thing is that Facebook admitted to sending Definers after George Soros. Six days later, that’s all that really matters. Instagram’s new profile designs emphasize users instead of their follower count Like Twitter before it, Instagram is shrinking follower counts on the profile. Who could buy Discord? Acquirers have been giving the gaming startup a long look. Teddy Schleifer looks at who might buy the platform popular among video game players and horrible racists. Some relevant chatter about Facebook: Facebook might make the most sense and the least sense of everyone on this list. The most sense because Facebook is the big tech company for communication and messaging, which is what Discord does. Plus Facebook has a strong interest in gamingand the reputation for going out and spending big on companies that can help expand its social networking moat. The biggest knock on the Facebook idea is that it feels unlikely that the government will let the social giant buy up another communications service. One person who has spoken with Facebook in the past said the company is concerned about antitrust regulators if it were to purchase Discord. WhatsApp ‘employee number 4’ jumps ship Neeraj Arora was WhatsApp’s chief business officer and often discussed as a potential replacement for Jan Koum. But then Facebook gave Chris Daniels the job, and now Arora is leaving after seven years. WhatsApp India head: Abhijit Bose to lead messaging platform in its biggest market WhatsApp has a new leader in India: The mobile messaging platform, owned by Facebook (FB), has appointed its first India chief, it said in a statement late on Wednesday. Abhijit Bose, co-founder and CEO of Indian digital payments firm Ezetap, will become head of WhatsApp India in early 2019. “Bose will build WhatsApp’s first full country team outside of California,” the company said. He will be based in Gurgaon, a rapidly growing tech hub on the outskirts of New Delhi that is also home to other big names like Google and Microsoft. WhatsApp Is Changing the Way India Talks About Food Priya Krishna examines how WhatsApp has become a hub for people to discuss farming and food — an unusual hybrid of online forum, help line, and blog: But among Indians who produce, cook or care about food, the service has been a godsend. In a country where culinary traditions are often spoken but not written, WhatsApp has provided an open, democratic forum where Indians can share and codify their knowledge and skills, in new ways, and even profit from them. “One of the problems with documenting Indian food is that the people who prepare it” — mainly homemakers, farmers and young cooks — “tend to be less empowered and less formally educated,” said Vikram Doctor, 51, a journalist in Mumbai. “They just don’t document. They are not comfortable using a computer or blogging, or people just don’t ask them.” Here’s How A Secret Meeting Of Twitter Execs And Indian Activists Caused A Caste Scandal Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey went to India and posed for a picture holding a poster reading “Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy,” a reference to harassment and abuse that takes place on Twitter and elsewhere as a result of India’s historical caste system. This caused a furious uproar among right-wing Hindus. The entire thing is as close as Silicon Valley has ever come to producing a perfect episode of Veep. How Twitch CEO Emmett Shear thinks about tech addiction Kurt Wagner talked to Twitch CEO Emmett Shear about tech addiction. He seemed mostly dismissive of the idea, which is surprising to me given how many of his streamers are broadcasting for eight or more hours a day: SHEAR: Twitch people don’t open our app that many times a day. They just open it for a long time when they do. And I actually think that’s a much healthier way of interacting with your technology, and with entertainment. You know? I go to a movie, I’ll spend two hours watching a movie. That doesn’t mean that I’m addicted to the movie. It just means that it’s a good piece of entertainment I decided to go sit down and watch. And I don’t necessarily think that’s such a big deal. That said, we definitely are paying attention to this, and I think that it’s really important for every tech business to be self-reflective about, you know, “Is this addictive? Are people actually getting value out of their usage?” And making sure people feel like … You know, you give them the tools to have control over that. Nothing launched Monday, as everyone was very tired from Thanksgiving. Lean Out Kara Swisher says Sheryl Sandberg is getting too much blame over the Definers scandal and that the real blame belongs with Mark Zuckerberg. To be clear, as the No. 2 in charge, Ms. Sandberg deserves much blame for the bad decisions at Facebook. But it’s notable that she is under much more fire than Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive. While he underwent some scrutiny at Congressional hearings and in interviews, he has somehow managed to come off like a geek who has lost his way in the woods. Whatever blame he got has dissipated quickly. Sheryl Sandberg Can’t Have It All Jennifer Senior says Sheryl Sandberg uniquely does deserve blame over the Definers scandal: What makes Sandberg’s current behavior so unsavory is that she put corporate interests — and her own image — ahead of the needs of democracy. She would sooner downplay Facebook’s involvement in a national security crisis than compromise the integrity of her reputation. And in so doing, Sandberg, one of the country’s most influential and renowned feminists, may have contributed to the historic loss of the first viable female candidate for president of the United States. Do You Have a Moral Duty to Leave Facebook? Philosopher S. Matthew Liao’s answer to the title question is maybe — but not yet: For now I’m going to stay on Facebook. But if new information suggests that Facebook has crossed a moral red line, we will all have an obligation to opt out. AI Mistakes Bus-Side Ad for Famous CEO, Charges Her With Jaywalking I’m sorry but this is the best story about artificial intelligence and facial recognition of all time: A facial recognition system in the city of Ningbo caught Dong Mingzhu, the chair of appliance-making giant Gree Electric, running a red light. Only it turned out not to be Dong, but rather an advertisement featuring her face on the side of a bus, local police said on Weibo Wednesday.

    Matt Berman Even for this chaotic administration, the last few weeks have taken a toll on President Donald Trump and his staff. A tragic mass shooting, big-name staff departures, and a series of scandals — all in the growing shadow of the investigation into Russia’s involvement in 2016 election — has left the White House under a dark cloud of low morale and constant frustration. Many mid- and low-level staffers are anxious to leave and are actively looking for jobs elsewhere, sources close to the White House say. Those staffers saw the surprising resignation of Trump loyalist and communications director Hope Hicks on Wednesday as a sort of tipping point. A former White House official said he's spoken with more aides inside the White House who are trying to leave the administration, but not necessarily getting the kinds of high-paying offers in the corporate world as former aides usually do. ""Things are still pretty bleak inside the White House,"" the source said. ""I've talked to several people in the last week trying to find a way out, but they can't get out because no one is really hiring people with Trump White House experience. Not a fun time to say the least."" Advertisement Another source close to the administration said he has also talked to those on the inside about potential job offers. The source said he remembers seeing one particularly fitting pun about Hick's departure on Thursday: ""The White House has lost Hope."" ""That about says it all, right?"" the source added. Meanwhile, Trump, with crises swirling around him, has been going rogue, taking positions that aren’t in line with the GOP and surprising his aides — more so than usual — with his comments on issues like trade and gun control. This level of chaos, unusual even in the relative terms of the Trump presidency, is underlined by a staff exodus. Trump famously values loyalty to a supreme degree. And right now, Trump’s White House is bleeding loyalists, and those who are left are under deepening pressure. Trump used an open-press meeting on guns with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Wednesday to essentially buck long-standing Republican orthodoxy and the National Rifle Association while siding with Democrats about the legitimacy of more stringent gun control proposals. He went as far as to say: “Take the guns first, go through due process second.” And on Thursday, Trump announced he wanted new tariffs on steel and aluminum, again with cameras rolling and without fully informing his staff of the decision. Members of Trump’s own party on Capitol Hill are still trying to figure out what to make of Trump’s recent comments, especially on guns. ""I don't know,"" said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, when asked about narrowing the conversation after Trump broadened it at Wednesday’s meeting. “You saw it, right? It was wild. I just I think the president's going to have to narrow his list of issues that he would like to see addressed and figure out ... what's realistic."" Advertisement There are any number of weeks or months from Trump’s first year in office that could reasonably be considered the most crisis-laden, but the last month is taking a real run at the crown. The spiral began soon after Trump’s first State of the Union address, when Trump’s staff secretary, who helped prepare the president for that speech, was accused of serial domestic abuse by two of his ex-wives. The White House defended Porter, who had become one of the staffers closest to Trump, before he ultimately resigned. That scandal raised another serious problem for the White House, and undermined chief of staff John Kelly’s authority: Some in the White House apparently knew about the allegations against Porter months before they were revealed in the press, and still allowed Porter access to highly sensitive information. The ensuing outcry over security clearances, and how dozens of White House staffers were able to operate under interim clearances while their background checks dragged on, quickly came to focus on Jared Kushner, Trump’s top adviser and son-in-law. Kushner, who came to the White House with complicated business dealings and has reportedly been a subject of the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in 2016’s election, had his clearance downgraded under new rules laid out by Kelly, significantly limiting his once infinite purview. Trump’s family is said to be frustrated by Kelly’s role in sidelining Kushner, and the president himself has fumed over Kelly’s handling of the Porter episode. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation hasn’t just recently impacted what information Kushner is able to access. The public results of that investigation — which is examining whether or not anyone from Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia or if the president himself has obstructed justice in the course of the investigation — have intensified in the last month, with indictments against over a dozen Russians and new charges in the cases against Trump’s former campaign chairman and his deputy. Even more troubling for Trump: that deputy, Rick Gates, flipped his plea to guilty, and is now working with investigators. Advertisement Mueller’s team is also now reportedly looking into Trump’s treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions last summer, and whether or not it constituted an attempt to remove him from office as a way of interfering with Mueller’s investigation. That report came to light this week just as Trump has renewed his pressure on Sessions. Sessions is now publicly defending himself, in an exceedingly rare and direct rebuttal to the president. Kushner has had few public defenders in recent weeks, with some blaming Kelly for how the president’s son-in-law is being treated. Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived former communications director, took jabs at Kelly, who fired him, on TV Thursday. The morale inside the White House, Scaramucci said on CNN, is “terrible. And the reason why the morale is terrible is the rule by fear and intimidation does not work in a civilian environment.” Kelly, for his part, joked at a Department of Homeland Security event Thursday morning that his time in the White House isn’t exactly a delight. Advertisement “I miss every one of you, every day,” Kelly, who was previously the department’s secretary, said to laughs and applause, before rolling his eyes. “The last thing I wanted to do was walk away from one of the great honors of my life, being the secretary of Homeland Security, but I did something wrong and God punished me, I guess.” Hicks, one of the last two remaining White House staffers who had been with Trump through his business and campaign, announced Wednesday her plan to leave her post as communications director. Her job title partially belies how important she has been to Trump, working closely with him through years of ups and downs. Those downs include Hicks’ reported role in devising a response to Donald Trump Jr.’s June 2016 meeting with with a Russian lawyer with Kremlin ties — a response that is now of particular interest to Mueller’s team. Hicks, who was also dating Porter at the time his alleged abuse was revealed, did not give a reason for her exit, but she had met privately with the House Intelligence Committee the day before. Also leaving is Josh Raffel, a top adviser and communications official to Kushner and Ivanka Trump. The timing is tricky for Trump’s family: Even more than the reduced security clearance, Kushner is under increasing pressure with reports this week that he met, in his official capacity as a White House adviser, with executives who gave loans to his family’s company, and that multiple foreign nations have discussed ways of leveraging Kushner’s business interests for their own advantage. Despite the increasing staff exodus, many Republicans remain hopeful that Trump will continue to sign their policy priorities and ignore the rest. Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson framed the departures as not out of the ordinary and “Washington as usual.” ""Somebody's always coming, and somebody's always going at the White House,” he said.

Ian David Long, 28, of Newbury Park had seven high-capacity, 30-round magazines in his possession, five of which were found fully loaded after the suspect fatally shot 12 people and then took his own life, Ayub said. Those magazines are illegal to purchase or possess in California but can be easily bought from neighboring states, he said during a news conference outside a sheriff’s station. Long had legally purchased a Glock .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol in August 2016 at a gunshop in Simi Valley, which is what he allegedly used to kill the victims, Ayub said. He also had a folding knife in his possession, which authorities said was apparently used to stab one of the slain victims in the neck.

He also had a flashlight with laser sight attached to his handgun. During a visit by deputies to Long’s home in April that was prompted by a disturbance call from neighbors, Long was not placed on an involuntary mental-health evaluation hold as he did not indicate a desire to harm himself or others, the sheriff said. He was upset about a financial matter involving his mother, having punched holes in the walls of the home. Long was evaluated at the time by both deputies and a mental-health crisis team made up of trained mental-health professionals from the Ventura County Behavioral Health Department, he said. The team provided Long with job placement and anger-management resources. Ayub said the suspect also did not mention a gun, nor did he display or exhibit a gun during that April incident. “Therefore, a gun-violence restraining order was not sought by anyone at the scene,” he said. Meanwhile, investigators said they are no closer to determining a motive than they were right after the Nov. 7 shooting. “At this point, we have no indication of radicalization, but along with the Sheriff’s Department, we continue to look to identify any motive,” Paul Delacourt, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, said at the press conference at a sheriff’s station in Thousand Oaks. Long, a 28-year-old U.S. Marine veteran, fatally shot the 12 people during a college country night before turning the gun on himself. Nearly two dozen other people wounded in the frantic chaos – some of whom had jumped out of windows to escape  – either drove themselves or were taken by citizens to hospitals, according to Ventura County fire officials. While Long previously had gone to the Borderline as a customer, he was not known by the establishment’s owner, Ayub said. The victims who were killed ranged in age from 18 to 54. They included a Pepperdine University student, a promoter for the bar who planned to join the U.S. Coast Guard, and an ex-Marine sergeant who dedicated his life to helping emotionally scarred veterans get back on their feet. RELATED: Here are the stories of all 12 Thousand Oaks mass shooting victims They also included Ventura County sheriff’s Sgt. Ron Helus, one of two responding officers to enter the bar and confront the gunman. Helus, a 29-year veteran with the department, has been credited for helping to save lives. California Highway Patrol Officer Todd Barrett had entered the bar with Helus. Helus and the CHP officer “both entered within minutes, and began searching with their rifles” when “the suspect ambushed the officers almost immediately from a position of tactical advantage,” Ayub said. Though both officers returned fire with multiple rounds, they did not strike Long, the sheriff said. Following that exchange, there were no additional shots fired by the suspect until he killed himself. But after a wounded Helus was pulled out of the bar to safety, deputies and responding officers started planning what “appeared to be a barricaded suspect situation,” for which SWAT team and crisis negotiators were summoned, Ayub said. In the minutes following the first 911 calls, responding deputies and officers from area agencies received conflicting information, including that there were multiple suspects and possibly multiple shooting locations. Witnesses also gave differing suspect descriptions, “giving responding deputies the belief that there was more than one suspect,” he said. “As you can imagine, this was a terrifying experience for everyone who was there,” Ayub said. “Confusion and chaos can only begin to adequately describe the situation.” There were also at least eight off-duty officers at the bar that night, including two deputies from the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office, Ayub said. Authorities previously said there were five or six. Ayub did not say whether any of them were armed at the time but noted that they did not fire any rounds inside the bar. “However, they helped other people escape from the scene and assisted responding deputies by providing valuable information about what had occurred inside,” he said. Dr. Christopher Young, the chief medical examiner for Ventura County, noted there have been questions about the severity of the victim’s injuries and whether they could have survived if they had been rescued sooner. “All of the victims died rapidly as a result of one or more gunshot wounds,” Young said. “The victims sustained injuries to vital areas. Many of the gunshot wounds were from close proximity, and there was no chance of survival.” Ventura County sheriff’s officials initially estimated that between 15 and 20 minutes had elapsed between the time that Helus entered, was shot and taken out of the bar until the second wave of law enforcement officers went inside. But a detailed timeline of events has yet to be provided. Young said he had no indication so far that any of those killed were struck by gunfire from anyone other than the gunman. Long died of a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, he added. The FBI supported the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office with evidence response teams that were at the scene for eight days “doing a professional and conscientious recovery of the victims and a thorough, painstaking recovery of the evidence,” Delacourt said. An FBI lab shooting reconstruction team also was on scene and is tasked with creating a shooting reconstruction report that will ultimately be provided to the sheriff, he said. Investigators have conducted more than 400 interviews so far in the case and that information, along with officers’ reports, body camera and surveillance footage and physical evidence, still have to be analyzed to produce a detailed timeline, Ayub said. “A lot of work has been done in examining this case, but there is much, much more to do,” the sheriff said. “I ask for your continued patience and support as we continue this lengthy process.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2018-11-27 14:29:02,"Gunman in Thousand Oaks mass shooting fired 50-plus shots, tossed multiple smoke grenades, but still no motive",,27512,http://www.ibabuzz.com/insider/

        Jason Wells Posted on November 27, 2018, at 2:29 p.m. ET The casket of Ventura County Sheriff Sgt. Ron Helus on Nov. 15, 2018. Authorities on Tuesday said despite hundreds of interviews, they still don’t know what motivated a man to shoot and kill 12 people inside a Southern California bar on Nov. 7. “We’re no closer to determining that today than we were at the onset,” Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub told reporters. Officials were able to fill in some details about how the shooting transpired at Borderline Bar & Grill in the community of Thousand Oaks. The shooter, 28-year-old Ian David Long, entered the bar around 11:18 p.m. during College Country Night and immediately began shooting off around 50 rounds. After throwing smoke bombs to add to the chaos, Ayub said the shooter then positioned himself to prepare for law enforcement, ambushing the two first responders “almost immediately from a position of tactical advantage.” Sheriff’s Sgt. Ron Helus was killed in the exchange before the shooter turned the gun on himself, Ayub added. When the scene was cleared, officials found seven illegal 30-round magazines, five of which were still fully loaded. Authorities said they were still working to determine how he acquired the high-capacity mags, although they acknowledged they can be legally purchased in other states. Ventura County Sheriff's Office Capt. Garo Kuredjian (left) and chaplains as they pray near the site of the Borderline bar shooting. In addition to still trying to determine a motive, Ayub said investigators were piecing together a detailed timeline of events as they review surveillance and body cam footage. The shooter’s social media activity was also still being reviewed. Paul Delacourt of the FBI added that there’s no evidence the gunman was radicalized. He also had no criminal history, and Ayub said a past call for a disturbance at Long’s mother’s home turned out to be related to an argument over money, for which officers did not think warranted involuntarily placing him on a psychiatric hold. The sheriff added that while the shooter had gone to Borderline as a customer in the past, the owner didn’t know him. The United States Marine Corps confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Long was enlisted from August 2008 to March 2013. He was an infantry machine gunner and attained the rank of corporal in 2011.

        Morgan Lieberman Posted on November 27, 2018, at 4:42 p.m. ET Since opening its doors in 1972 in Los Angeles, Beth Chayim Chadashim (BCC), which means “house of new life,” has offered a Reform, progressive space for LGBT Jewish individuals who had previously been excluded from religious environments. Considered the first of its kind, the BCC came to fruition only a few years after the Stonewall riots and not a moment too soon: Less than 10 years later, it would find itself supporting its community through the heartache and hardships of the AIDS epidemic that took several of its members. In 1994, Beth Chayim Chadashim appointed Rabbi Lisa Edwards to the position of head rabbi, making her BCC's first openly gay rabbi at ordination to lead the temple. Since that time, Edwards has remained a pillar of strength and guidance within the temple, marrying same-sex couples, nurturing the growth of BCC’s families, and leading her community through difficult times, such as the mass shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh just last month. “It’s been such a blessing in my life,” said Edwards when we spoke to her, “I’ve been so blessed and lucky that I was of the age I was and had the opportunity I have had to serve this community, this congregation, these people. It’s been the blessing of my life.” Morgan Lieberman began documenting Edwards and the BCC community in January for her project, Pride Over Prejudice. As a queer Jewish documentary filmmaker and photographer, Lieberman hopes to use this project to shed a light on a community she admires, respects, and identifies with. Here we share a few of the images from her series that truly exemplify why, 46 years later, the world’s first LGBT synagogue remains vital to the Los Angeles community it serves. Nestled in Mid-City, an area with over 20 synagogues that has historically been a cultural hub for the city’s most religious Jews, and where Kosher delis close early on Friday evenings for the observance of Shabbat, BCC is a unique fixture in an otherwise Orthodox community. In February, the temple hosted a “Totally 80s Purim” celebration where members of the congregation parodied famous ’80s songs to represent stories and fables of the Jewish holiday. Dressed in a colorful costume, Rabbi Edwards looked on in amusement as Cantor Juval Porat sang Blondie’s “Heart of Glass.” Another member was dressed as artist Keith Haring protesting California ballot Proposition 64, which health professionals opposed, believing that “AIDS victims who fear losing their jobs or their liberty will be driven underground, hampering efforts to control the disease.” This year marked the 10-year anniversary of the monumental California Supreme Court victory for same-sex marriage, which was ruled constitutional on June 16, 2008. In the months following, Edwards married close to 50 couples, appropriately deeming it the “summer of love,” before legal battles put ceremonies on pause for the next five years. Edwards said it was powerful to see “couples that had been together for a very long time who were getting married for the first time to each other.” She found it equally powerful to see couples who had been married before it was legal asking one another to do it again for a second time. “I always find it such a blessing for couples to be able to say to each other, ‘Would you marry me again?’” In March, Edwards said she was moved to officiate the wedding ceremony of BCC member Elyse Saragossi, who grew up in the congregation. Her parents, Bonnie Moore and Carol Saragossi, had tasked Edwards with Elyse’s baby naming and bat mitzvah years earlier, making the ceremony that much more meaningful to Edwards and the family. From the many marriages Edwards has officiated, families continue to grow the congregation. BCC hosts events throughout the year, outside of the temple, to help keep the BCC family closer than ever. In May, members gathered on the beach in Santa Monica for a day of bonding and a bonfire later in the evening. “LGBT families have a lot of options in the Jewish community now, thankfully,” said Edwards, “but the community here is made up of parents who want to be part of [it].” She also finds the diverse blend of families to be a huge benefit for the children, “it’s quite a mix,” she said, “and it gives such a wide range of experiences to the kids who get to be part of this community.” It’s with the love and support of her wife, Tracy Moore, a board member of the One Archives Foundation and an influential activist for both the temple and the LGBT community at large, that Rabbi Edwards leads Beth Chayim Chadashim. Edwards and Moore were one of the many couples who were legally married during the summer of love in 2008. Moore’s pride for the work and achievements of her wife is endearingly displayed via her license plate, which reads “LEZBTZN,” a play on words referring to “rebbetzin,” the Yiddish word for the wife of a rabbi. Each year, BCC hosts a Vision Awards brunch to present congregational awards to those deserving of recognition for their service and dedication to the LGBT community. At this year’s brunch in June, Edwards and Moore presented member of Congress Karen Bass, BCC’s congressional district representative, with the Harriet Perl Tzedek Award. Bass has worked closely with Edwards and Moore over the years, and was also the officiant who married them in 2008. On Oct. 27, a gunman walked into Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and opened fire during morning Shabbat services. Eleven people were murdered in what the Anti-Defamation League described as the deadliest attack on Jews in American History. With the Jewish community reeling from the horrific and senseless act, Edwards helped organize a vigil for Tree of Life victims at the Federal Building in Westwood, California, the very next day. “It’s [important] that we be there for one another, that we gather together, that we stay strong and united against forces that would really rather divide us,"" Edwards said. Above all, it’s the strength of the congregation that will get them through this dark time in Jewish history. “[BCC is] made up of a lot of people who have really become family to each other over the years,” said Edwards, “and find that this should be the place where their friendship circle is, where they go to when they have needs or sorrows in their lives, but also the place where they go to celebrate. Where they take seriously the idea of living a Jewish lifestyle and living in Jewish community.” The meaning of Beth Chayim Chadashim, ""house of new life"", was misstated in an earlier version of this post, as was the fact that Rabbi Lisa Edwards was BCC's first rabbi to be openly gay at ordination.

A passerby stops to look over a street side memorial to the shooting victims of the Borderline Bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif. on Tuesday, Nov. 27, 2018. Investigators said Tuesday that the number of victims from a shooting at a country music bar in Southern California this month could have been much higher based on the amount of ammunition the gunman carried. (AP Photo/Amanda Lee Myers) THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. – The gunman who killed 12 people in a crowded Southern California bar had more than 150 bullets left to fire but stopped shooting to ambush arriving officers, killing one of them, police said Tuesday. Investigators said they still don't know why 28-year-old Ian David Long attacked staff and customers at the Borderline Bar and Grill in the Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks on Nov. 7. There's no evidence that Long was radicalized or was targeting anyone at the bar, and though Long had previously been a customer there, the owner didn't know him, investigators said. They painted a clearer picture of the chaos that ensued when Long opened fire as a crowd of people mostly in their 20s danced to country music. Long threw smoke grenades into the group of revelers, obstructing what they could see. He used a flashlight with a laser sight attached to his .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol as he fired, killing 12 of the 13 people who were struck. He stabbed one of the shooting victims in the neck, though it was unclear why, a coroner's official said. Some people laid on top of friends to protect them as the bullets flew while others frantically busted out the windows of the bar to escape. ""As you can imagine, this was a terrifying experience for everyone who was there,"" Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said. ""Confusion and chaos can only begin to adequately describe the situation."" The first two officers to arrive at the scene, sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus and a highway patrolman, saw at least 100 people fleeing the bar and ran into an ambush, Ayub said. Long had gotten into a tactical position and fired on them when they entered, killing Helus, a 29-year veteran of the department who was close to retirement. Initial reports from survivors spread further confusion. Some of those who were injured in the escape fled to a nearby bar and authorities at first feared that a separate shooting had occurred there. Survivors also gave different descriptions of the shooter, leading officers to believe there was more than one gunman. Long, who was not hit by the officers' gunfire, fatally shot himself. The former machine gunner and Afghanistan war veteran posted on social media during a break in the gunfire that he wondered if people would think he was insane. He had the capability to kill many more than 12 people. Of seven 30-round high-capacity magazines that Long had, five remained unused, Ayub said. Such magazines are illegal to buy and possess in California but can easily be purchased in neighboring states. The mother of one of the victims, Telemachus ""Tel"" Orfanos, said she went to the news conference to make sure her son was remembered as more than a statistic. Susan Schmidt-Orfanos said she was putting her energy into working for gun-control measures. Her son had survived the mass shooting last year in Las Vegas before being killed at Borderline. ""There's no place to put my anger,"" she said. ""We need to end gun violence so that no other families grieve and are shattered as we are shattered. That's where my rage is going to go."" Investigators have interviewed hundreds of witnesses and gathered bullet casings, surveillance video and other evidence from the scene, as well as seized items from Long's home, including digital media, said Paul Delacourt, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. Most of the evidence taken by the FBI is being analyzed at its lab in Quantico, Virginia. Detectives hope items from the house help them learn why Long carried out the attack and that evidence from the bar better explains how he carried it out. ""There's a process of both interviewing the people and getting the information investigators obtain and consolidating those to develop a timeline, and if we can discover what the motivation was for this attack,"" Ventura County sheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian said. Their work persisted in spite of a wildfire that erupted just hours after the shooting, forcing some FBI investigators and sheriff's detectives to evacuate. ""They didn't miss a beat,"" said Kuredjian. Neighbors have said Long made them uncomfortable and even called 911 on him in April. Responding deputies found Long behaving angrily and irrationally, but a mental health specialist who met with him didn't feel he needed to be hospitalized. Two of Long's former high school track coaches described his behavior during his teenage years as aggressive and disturbing. They told The Associated Press that they repeatedly complained about Long to school administrators, insisted that he needed help, and even kicked him off the team after he assaulted one of them. They say another coach reinstated Long after arguing that removing him could jeopardize his goal of joining the military. ___ Associated Press Writer Brian Melley contributed to this report from Los Angeles.

But an exact motive in the Nov. 7 mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill — carried out by 28-year-old former Marine Ian David Long — has still not been determined, Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said at a news conference. ""As to the motive of the suspect, we are no closer to determining that today than we were at the onset of the incident,"" he said. ""Investigators are analyzing information from the suspect's family, friends, and witnesses as well as evidence collected from his home and from the bar. That analysis will take a considerable amount of time."" Long used a .45-caliber Glock handgun which he legally purchased in August of 2016 from a gun shop in the Simi Valley, and fired a total of more than 50 rounds during the shooting, according to Ayub. Long had seven 30-round magazines, which are illegal in California but can easily be bought in neighboring states, and investigators found five of those magazines fully loaded after Long killed himself, Ayub said. The gunman also had a flashlight with a laser sight attached to the handgun and he ""threw multiple smoke grenades while inside the bar, which contributed significantly to the chaos and confusion inside,"" Ayub said. Long entered the bar at around 11:18 p.m. PT that night and ""immediately began firing his weapon,"" Ayub said, and after shooting people inside Long lay in wait for responding law enforcement. One of two officers who responded, Ventura County sheriff’s Sgt. Ron Helus, 54, was shot dead by Long. ""The suspect ambushed the officers almost immediately from a position of tactical advantage,” Ayub said. Those two offers returned fire but none of those rounds struck the suspect, he said. When Helus and the other officer arrived at the scene, more than 100 people were already fleeing the bar, some of whom were jumping through windows to escape, Ayub said. ""As you can imagine, this was a terrifying experience for everyone who was there,” Ayub said. “Confusion and chaos can only begin to adequately describe the situation."" Long shot 13 people in all, only one of whom survived, Ayub said. After Long killed himself, police found more than a dozen people who were still hiding in an attic and in other areas inside the bar, he said. Long wrote on social media during the attack that he was bored but sane, law enforcement sources have previously told NBC News. Paul Delacourt, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, said that investigators conducted ""hundreds of interviews of victims and witnesses and others that may have known the subject,"" and that investigators have recovered some digital media which was sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. ""At this point, we have no indication of radicalization, but along with the sheriff's department we continue to look to identify any motive,"" Delacourt said.

In one of the first major press conferences since the Nov. 7 mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, officials from the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, the FBI and Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office detailed how the suspect fired more than 50 rounds at patrons, put himself in position to attack law enforcement and spoke about the victims' chances of survival. ""As to the motive, we are no closer to determining that today than we were at the onset of the incident,"" Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayu said. But investigators have ruled out some reasons for the rampage. ""At this point, we have no indication of radicalization but, along with the sheriff's department, we continue to look to identify any motive,"" said Paul Delacourt, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. More: 3 minutes of terror: How the Thousand Oaks shooting unfolded Opinion: Thousand Oaks shooting shows America's inaction on gun violence puts cops in the firing line Former Marine Ian David Long, 28, is the alleged shooter. Officials believe he entered the Borderline bar just before just before 11:20 p.m. and opened fire with a Glock 21, a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol equipped with a high-capacity magazine. Before Long turned the gun on himself, he allegedly killed 12 people, including sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus. Watching the conference from a nearby sidewalk was the family of Telemachus ‘Tel’ Orfanos, a 27-year-old victim of the massacre. “We felt it was important to be here,” said Marc Orfanos, Telemachus’ father, as his wife, Susan Schmidt-Orfanos and a son, Tymaeus ‘Ty’ Orfanos, stood nearby, giving interviews to media members. “Our goal is to find a way to curb gun violence,” Marc Orfanos said. “It takes being able to buck up and just lay everything out.” “I just hope no one else feels it,” he said, referring to the pain of losing his son. In the days since the shooting, FBI investigators have worked alongside sheriff's homicide detectives to collect hundreds of pieces of evidence from Borderline and Long's home. An estimated 90 FBI investigators were on scene during the eight days they surveyed the crime scene and Long's home, Ayub said. No other weapons were located at the scene or at Long's home, officials said. The suspect did not have a license to carry a concealed weapon, Ayub said. ""Part of this ongoing investigation will be to construct a detailed timeline of how and when these events unfolded. At this time, we do not have the details in place to provide you with that,"" Ayub said. On the night of the shooting, Ayub said Long entered the bar at 11:18 p.m. and immediately began firing at patrons and throwing smoke grenades. A flashlight and a laser were attached to the handgun, Ayub said. Long fired more than 50 rounds and stabbed at least one patron with a folding knife. ""After shooting the victims inside the bar, the suspect positioned himself in preparation for the law enforcement response,"" Ayub said. Related: Ashton Kutcher reveals he had party at same bar as Thousand Oaks shooting, pleads for gun reform Helus and a California Highway Patrol officer entered the bar and were met with gunfire. ""The suspect ambushed the officers nearly immediately from a position of tactical advantage,"" Ayub said. By the time Long died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, he had struck 13 people with gunfire, only one of whom would survive. The firearm used in the shooting had been purchased legally by Long in 2016 at a Simi Valley gun shop, Ayub said. The high-capacity magazines, however, are illegal to possess and purchase in California. At the time of the shooting, Long was reportedly in possession of seven high-capacity magazines, five of which were recovered fully loaded, Ayub said. In the aftermath of shooting, Ventura County Medical Examiner Christopher Young said his agency worked with the help of two physicians from Los Angeles County. ""All of the victims died rapidly as the result of one or more gunshot wounds. The victims sustained injuries to vital areas. Many of the gunshot wounds were from close proximity and there was no chance of survival,"" Young said. Young added he has no information to suggest that the bullets fired by law enforcement struck any of the victims  The rifles used by officers leave distinct types of wounds and have a distinct appearance on X-rays, he said. ""All of the evidence that I have so far indicates that these injuries were caused by a handgun like the one carried by the suspect,"" Young said.

Daniel Leger, who is a nurse and chaplain at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, was released from the hospital Tuesday. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports Leger was shot in the torso during the Oct. 27 mass shooting, which killed 11 people. Authorities say suspected shooter Robert Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. Bowers remains jailed without bail and has pleaded not guilty to numerous murder and hate crime charges. With Leger’s release, Pittsburgh Police Officer Timothy Matson remains the only wounded victim still hospitalized. The hospital says Matson remains in stable condition.

22,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-life-hospital-safety-measures-20181127-story.html,"Following the mass shooting at Mercy Hospital & Medical Center last week, Chicago-area hospitals are reviewing their safety precautions and preparing to meet the requirements of a new law that mandates violence-prevention training and other security measures. Some say the shooting that left three people and the gunman dead highlights how dangerous hospitals can be, and that steps should be taken to prevent such violence. To that end, two state legislators are reviving a push for a law that would mandate metal detectors in hospitals. But others say a one-size-fits-all approach, like metal detectors, isn’t the answer, and that hospitals already engage in a number of protocols designed as safeguards, including security guards, active shooter drills and de-escalation training. During the Nov. 19 shooting, gunman Juan Lopez, 32, started firing his gun outside the hospital, where he fatally shot his ex-fiancee Dr. Tamara O’Neal, 38, who worked at Mercy. Lopez then went inside the emergency department, where he shot and killed 24-year-old pharmacist Dayna Less and 28-year-old Chicago police Officer Samuel Jimenez. Lopez later shot himself in the head, police said. “A hospital is supposed to be a place of healing and recovery … and we’re seeing that it’s now a place where a mass shooting can take place,” said Alice Johnson, executive director of the Illinois Nurses Association. The group helped draft legislation approved earlier this year that increases violence-prevention efforts at hospitals, including risk assessments of their facilities. The new law takes effect Jan. 1 and was written in response to an incident in far west suburban Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital in Geneva, where nurses were taken hostage and assaulted by an inmate who was a patient. Johnson said that while there are no solutions that would prevent all violence in hospitals, “obviously there’s a lot of work left to be done here.” Hospitals throughout the state are working to comply with the new law, said Danny Chun, spokesman for the Illinois Health and Hospital Association. At some hospitals, the Mercy shooting heightened efforts to address safety and security. At Amita Health’s 19 hospitals, officials are planning more in-person training for staff and reviewing policies, including ensuring that employees know what to do if an armed intruder enters their buildings, said Melissa Granato, associate vice president of security. “Unfortunately, there’s no one solution that’s going to prevent these types of incidents, which is why we find it’s so important to routinely assess all of our locations and train all of our associates,” she said. “Violence in health care is something that’s become incredibly common and something we deal with on an ongoing basis, which is why we’re trying so hard to make sure we’re putting all these measures in place to provide that safe environment.” Advocate Aurora Health also is accelerating its safety training and refresher training at all its inpatient and outpatient facilities, including its 27 hospitals in Illinois and Wisconsin. And, in coming weeks, it plans to require all employees to complete an active shooter response class online, spokesman Adam Mesirow said in an email. Efforts to meet the requirements of the upcoming violence prevention law have already been in the works, he said. The Mercy shooting led two state lawmakers to try to drum up support for previously failed legislation that would mandate metal detectors in hospitals. State Rep. La Shawn K. Ford, D-Chicago, and state Sen. Laura Murphy, D-Des Plaines, said they plan to re-introduce the bills in coming months. Ford, whose bill would also place the devices in other public spaces, like schools, said metal detectors serve as a deterrent and offer a sense of safety to the public. “When you go to the airport, you automatically know you better not bring a gun,” he said. “We just have to know what type of society we’re living in right now. No one likes going through metal detectors … but it is something that’s probably going to become the norm for public spaces. We should be on the forefront of this.” Like many hospitals throughout the state, the Amita facilities do not have metal detectors. “We’ve made the determination that other combinations of options are more effective than the metal detectors would be in our facilities,” Granato said. University of Chicago Medical Center also doesn’t have them. “Hospitals have the delicate balance of being welcoming for patients and visitors while providing a safe and secure environment,” spokeswoman Ashley Heher said in an email. She noted the center does have a number of other security measures in place, including cameras, security officers and a badge access system. Murphy, whose bill would only require metal detectors in hospitals, acknowledged that it wouldn’t “solve all the problems. There’s still a bigger discussion that needs to be had.” Chun, of the hospital association, said the group opposes the bills, because a blanket requirement for metal detectors at all hospitals, regardless of their setting, is not the best approach to security. “There are multiple approaches hospitals take,” he said. Security “is a priority. They prepare for it, they drill on it. They have procedures and protocols in place.” Hospitals also worry metal detectors could compromise access for critical patients, he said. “If you’re having a heart attack or stroke and you have to wait in line for a metal detector, that could make a difference in the outcome.” But at Mount Sinai Hospital in the Chicago’s Douglas Park neighborhood, administrators decided metal detectors were needed. Last year, after a threat assessment, the devices were placed at the emergency department entrance, said Raymond Martinez, director of security. Since then, security staff members have confiscated “a number of items,” he said. “Anything from cigarette lighters to box cutters.” It takes seconds for someone to walk through the detectors; critical patients coming in on stretchers bypass the devices, and instead their belongings are checked if deemed necessary, said Michele Mazurek, chief nursing officer and vice president of patient care services. Mazurek said metal detectors are becoming the norm for most public places but remain “newer to the hospital system.” “Hospitals have always been what’s known in the medical community as safe zones … so you don’t bring your gun into the safe zone,” she said. “Unfortunately, our world is changing.” Mazurek also said high emotions and other factors surrounding hospitals make them ripe for conflict, and it’s up to administrators to figure out how to best protect staff and patients. “We need to make sure that environment is the most safe environment.” kthayer@chicagotribune.com lschencker@chicagotribune.com Twitter @knthayer Twitter @lschencker CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2018-11-28 06:00:00,"'A hospital is supposed to be a place of healing': In the wake of Mercy shooting, hospitals review safety measures",,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/

This week, President Donald Trump, without citing any evidence, said a lot of migrants attempt to “grab a child” near the border to make up false family connections and enter the United States more easily. However, according to his own administration’s numbers, this is not true. Figures provided by US Customs and Border Protection show that in a five-month period this year, just 0.25% of families stopped by border agents were found to have made a false claim. That period includes the arrival a previous migrant caravan in May. You should also know: That viral photo of the mother fleeing tear gas with her children at the border is now fodder for more conspiracy theories. Trump is pushing a border wall showdown in Congress, but there’s not much he can do. Earlier this month, a man shot and killed 12 people inside a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Now, hundreds of interviews later, authorities say they have no idea what motivated him. As the search for an explanation continues, the local sheriff said, “We’re no closer to determining that today than we were at the onset.” An agent with the FBI added that there’s no evidence the gunman was radicalized. The shooter’s social media activity was also still being reviewed. Three US soldiers were killed in Afghanistan in the deadliest attack on American troops this year. A roadside bomb wounded three other US service members as well as an American contractor. The Pentagon is withholding the names of the troops killed until 24 hours after their families have been notified. Stephen Hillenburg, the creator of SpongeBob SquarePants, has died at 57. Hillenburg, who used his background in marine biology to create the hit show, revealed last year that he had ALS. After his diagnosis, he continued working on the cartoon, which has been running since 1999. People are paying their tributes. The CDC says California is the source of E. coli-contaminated romaine lettuce. Some romaine lettuce is safe to eat, but only if you know for sure it wasn't grown in the central or northern coastal regions of California. A gamer says he overheard another player rape a teen girl while playing Grand Theft Auto. The witness claims the suspect stopped playing for around 15 minutes but left his headset microphone on. He told investigators he heard the alleged victim “moan and groan” and then say “no.” A Syrian man who was stranded in an airport since March has been granted asylum in Canada. Hassan al-Kontar, who had been stuck in a Malaysian airport, was welcomed by his supporters upon touching down in Vancouver. Ariana Grande released a trailer for her music video for “Thank U Next.” The video, which will showcase pop culture homages from Mean Girls to Bring It On to Legally Blonde, looks HYPE, and the trailer is really, really fun. Also: We do trailers for music videos now. Two stories from inside two tech giants: At Facebook, a former employee said the company has a “black people problem.” Mark S. Luckie delivered the blunt assessment of Facebook’s diversity and inclusion efforts in a 2,500-word memo before his departure from the company. The memo paints a picture of Facebook having a superficial understanding of diversity. At Google, workers are openly asking their bosses to cancel the company’s secret, censored search engine in China. This time, employees are signing their real names in asking Google to cancel Project Dragonfly. This is a remarkable decision in an industry where workers publicizing secret projects are maligned and often punished. A traditional Chinese garden in Vancouver has been shut down because a river otter is preying on the resident koi fish population. See, one of the beautiful features of the garden is its koi pond — it houses 14 of the prized and pricey fish. New koi can cost thousands of dollars. The otter has eaten 11 of those fish — and he’s still not been caught yet. In keeping with the memeing of life, people have started #TeamOtter and #TeamKoi hashtags. The otter is winning. By a lot.

Some say the shooting that left three people and the gunman dead highlights how dangerous hospitals can be, and that steps should be taken to prevent such violence. To that end, two state legislators are reviving a push for a law that would mandate metal detectors in hospitals. But others say a one-size-fits-all approach, like metal detectors, isn’t the answer, and that hospitals already engage in a number of protocols designed as safeguards, including security guards, active shooter drills and de-escalation training. During the Nov. 19 shooting, gunman Juan Lopez, 32, started firing his gun outside the hospital, where he fatally shot his ex-fiancee Dr. Tamara O’Neal, 38, who worked at Mercy. Lopez then went inside the emergency department, where he shot and killed 24-year-old pharmacist Dayna Less and 28-year-old Chicago police Officer Samuel Jimenez. Lopez later shot himself in the head, police said. “A hospital is supposed to be a place of healing and recovery … and we’re seeing that it’s now a place where a mass shooting can take place,” said Alice Johnson, executive director of the Illinois Nurses Association. The group helped draft legislation approved earlier this year that increases violence-prevention efforts at hospitals, including risk assessments of their facilities. The new law takes effect Jan. 1 and was written in response to an incident in far west suburban Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital in Geneva, where nurses were taken hostage and assaulted by an inmate who was a patient. Johnson said that while there are no solutions that would prevent all violence in hospitals, “obviously there’s a lot of work left to be done here.” Hospitals throughout the state are working to comply with the new law, said Danny Chun, spokesman for the Illinois Health and Hospital Association. At some hospitals, the Mercy shooting heightened efforts to address safety and security. At Amita Health’s 19 hospitals, officials are planning more in-person training for staff and reviewing policies, including ensuring that employees know what to do if an armed intruder enters their buildings, said Melissa Granato, associate vice president of security. “Unfortunately, there’s no one solution that’s going to prevent these types of incidents, which is why we find it’s so important to routinely assess all of our locations and train all of our associates,” she said. “Violence in health care is something that’s become incredibly common and something we deal with on an ongoing basis, which is why we’re trying so hard to make sure we’re putting all these measures in place to provide that safe environment.” Advocate Aurora Health also is accelerating its safety training and refresher training at all its inpatient and outpatient facilities, including its 27 hospitals in Illinois and Wisconsin. And, in coming weeks, it plans to require all employees to complete an active shooter response class online, spokesman Adam Mesirow said in an email. Efforts to meet the requirements of the upcoming violence prevention law have already been in the works, he said. The Mercy shooting led two state lawmakers to try to drum up support for previously failed legislation that would mandate metal detectors in hospitals. State Rep. La Shawn K. Ford, D-Chicago, and state Sen. Laura Murphy, D-Des Plaines, said they plan to re-introduce the bills in coming months. Ford, whose bill would also place the devices in other public spaces, like schools, said metal detectors serve as a deterrent and offer a sense of safety to the public. “When you go to the airport, you automatically know you better not bring a gun,” he said. “We just have to know what type of society we’re living in right now. No one likes going through metal detectors … but it is something that’s probably going to become the norm for public spaces. We should be on the forefront of this.” Like many hospitals throughout the state, the Amita facilities do not have metal detectors. “We’ve made the determination that other combinations of options are more effective than the metal detectors would be in our facilities,” Granato said. University of Chicago Medical Center also doesn’t have them. “Hospitals have the delicate balance of being welcoming for patients and visitors while providing a safe and secure environment,” spokeswoman Ashley Heher said in an email. She noted the center does have a number of other security measures in place, including cameras, security officers and a badge access system. Murphy, whose bill would only require metal detectors in hospitals, acknowledged that it wouldn’t “solve all the problems. There’s still a bigger discussion that needs to be had.” Chun, of the hospital association, said the group opposes the bills, because a blanket requirement for metal detectors at all hospitals, regardless of their setting, is not the best approach to security. “There are multiple approaches hospitals take,” he said. Security “is a priority. They prepare for it, they drill on it. They have procedures and protocols in place.” Hospitals also worry metal detectors could compromise access for critical patients, he said. “If you’re having a heart attack or stroke and you have to wait in line for a metal detector, that could make a difference in the outcome.” But at Mount Sinai Hospital in the Chicago’s Douglas Park neighborhood, administrators decided metal detectors were needed. Last year, after a threat assessment, the devices were placed at the emergency department entrance, said Raymond Martinez, director of security. Since then, security staff members have confiscated “a number of items,” he said. “Anything from cigarette lighters to box cutters.” It takes seconds for someone to walk through the detectors; critical patients coming in on stretchers bypass the devices, and instead their belongings are checked if deemed necessary, said Michele Mazurek, chief nursing officer and vice president of patient care services. Mazurek said metal detectors are becoming the norm for most public places but remain “newer to the hospital system.” “Hospitals have always been what’s known in the medical community as safe zones … so you don’t bring your gun into the safe zone,” she said. “Unfortunately, our world is changing.” Mazurek also said high emotions and other factors surrounding hospitals make them ripe for conflict, and it’s up to administrators to figure out how to best protect staff and patients. “We need to make sure that environment is the most safe environment.” kthayer@chicagotribune.com lschencker@chicagotribune.com Twitter @knthayer Twitter @lschencker CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2018-11-28 08:00:00,"In wake of Mercy shooting, Chicago hospitals weigh security options",,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/
25,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ian-david-long-thousand-oaks-bar-shooter-had-enough-ammo-to-kill-many-more/,"Watch CBSN Live  Updated on:  December 7, 2018 / 3:33 PM
          / CBS/AP THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- The gunman who killed 12 people in a crowded Southern California bar had more than 150 bullets left to fire but stopped shooting to ambush arriving officers, killing one of them, police said. Investigators said Tuesday they still don't know why 28-year-old Ian David Long attacked staff and customers at the Borderline Bar and Grill in the Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks on Nov. 7. They painted a clearer picture of the chaos that ensued when Long opened fire as a crowd of people mostly in their 20s danced to country music. Long threw smoke grenades into the group of revelers, obstructing what they could see. He used a flashlight with a laser sight attached to his .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol as he fired, killing 12 of the 13 people who were struck. He stabbed one of the shooting victims in the neck, though it was unclear why, a coroner's official said. The first two officers to arrive at the scene, sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus and a highway patrolman, saw at least 100 people fleeing the bar and ran into an ambush, Ayub said. Long had gotten into a tactical position and fired on them when they entered. Helus, a 29-year veteran of the department who was close to retirement, was killed. Some people laid on top of friends to protect them as the bullets flew while others frantically busted out the windows of the bar to escape. ""As you can imagine, this was a terrifying experience for everyone who was there,"" Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said. ""Confusion and chaos can only begin to adequately describe the situation."" Initial reports from survivors spread further confusion. Some of those who were injured in the escape fled to a nearby bar and authorities at first feared that a separate shooting had occurred there. Survivors also gave different descriptions of the shooter, leading officers to believe there was more than one gunman. Long, who was not hit by the officers' gunfire, fatally shot himself. The former machine gunner and Afghanistan war veteran posted on social media during a break in the gunfire that he wondered if people would think he was insane. He had the capability to kill many more than 12 people. Of seven 30-round high-capacity magazines that Long had, five remained unused, Ayub said. Such magazines are illegal to buy and possess in California but can easily be purchased in neighboring states. There's no evidence that Long was radicalized or was targeting anyone at the bar, and though Long had previously been a customer there, the owner didn't know him, investigators said. The mother of one of the victims, Telemachus ""Tel"" Orfanos, said she went to the news conference to make sure her son was remembered as more than a statistic. Susan Schmidt-Orfanos said she was putting her energy into working for gun-control measures. Her son had survived the mass shooting last year in Las Vegas before being killed at Borderline. ""There's no place to put my anger,"" she said. ""We need to end gun violence so that no other families grieve and are shattered as we are shattered. That's where my rage is going to go."" Todd Stratton was at the bar when the massacre unfolded. He'd also been friends with Long for 11 years and told CBS News he thought he might be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when he came back from deployment in Afghanistan in 2013. ""There was times where people would ask him about it and he got kind of, you know, upset and said he didn't, you know, like talking about it,"" Stratton said. Investigators have interviewed hundreds of witnesses and gathered bullet casings, surveillance video and other evidence from the scene, as well as seized items from Long's home, including digital media, said Paul Delacourt, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. Most of the evidence taken by the FBI is being analyzed at its lab in Quantico, Virginia. Detectives hope items from the house help them learn why Long carried out the attack and that evidence from the bar better explains how he carried it out. ""There's a process of both interviewing the people and getting the information investigators obtain and consolidating those to develop a timeline, and if we can discover what the motivation was for this attack,"" Ventura County sheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian said. Their work persisted in spite of a wildfire that erupted just hours after the shooting, forcing some FBI investigators and sheriff's detectives to evacuate. ""They didn't miss a beat,"" said Kuredjian. Neighbors have said Long made them uncomfortable and even called 911 on him in April. Responding deputies found Long behaving angrily and irrationally, but a mental health specialist who met with him didn't feel he needed to be hospitalized. Two of Long's former high school track coaches described his behavior during his teenage years as aggressive and disturbing. Dominique Colell, who coached girls' track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative. In one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete. In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his. ""I literally feared for myself around him,"" Colell said. ""He was the only athlete that I was scared of."" Editor's note: On Dec. 7, investigators revealed that Sgt. Ron Helus was accidentally killed by a patrolman's bullet; he was also struck 5 times by the gunman. Read the latest story here.

26,https://ew.com/trailers/2018/11/28/natalie-portman-sia-vox-lux-trailer/,"The new trailer for the art house drama Vox Lux features the chilling original song “Wrapped Up” from Sia, performed by the film’s star Natalie Portman. Directed by Brady Corbet, the story centers on the survivor of a mass shooting named Celeste (Portman) who rises to fame after performing a song at a vigil for the victims of the massacre. Years later, finding herself washed up and heavily dependent on alcohol, she is determined to revive her career with a comeback concert. But when a terrorist attack believed to be inspired by her music takes place ahead of the event, old wounds are reopened that hinder her return to the stage. The film, which EW’s Chris Nashawaty called a “wildly ambitious pop-idol cautionary tale,” explores the complexities of life in the spotlight and the vulturous nature of media scrutiny. As with the initial trailer, the latest promo for the project offers a glimpse at Portman’s garish onstage getups and the emotional turmoil Celeste faces at the hands of global superstardom. The softer side of the fiery relationship between the singer and her manager (Jude Law) is also shown in a reassuring speech he gives her before she takes the stage early in her career. Sia teamed with composer Scott Walker to write a series of songs expressly for the production. Vox Lux hits theaters on Dec. 7.

Cheery and energetic, the young girl had made the video to describe the moment her parents told her she was a finalist to be a youth ambassador in a US state department-sponsored study exchange that would take her thousands of miles away from her home in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, for a year.  “I didn’t believe it,” Sabika said. “They came into my room, and I was squealing, jumping like a madman. I prayed to God and thanked him a lot. Seeing those proud smiles on my parents’ faces, that was the best moment of my life.” In the video, Sabika speaks in the chattering cadence of a teenage girl. Just a little more than a year after she posted that video on YouTube, Sabika, 17, was one of 10 killed in a mass shooting at a Texas high school. On Wednesday, her parents joined the family members of some of the other victims in filing a lawsuit against the 17-year-old suspect’s parents, Antonios Pagourtzis and Rose Marie Kosmetatos. The suit alleges the parents were not only negligent in allowing their son to gain access to a shotgun and a revolver legally owned by the father, but in failing to respond to warning signs that their son posed a risk to others. An attorney for the suspect’s parents had previously denied all allegations in an earlier court filing, before Sabika’s parents joined the lawsuit, arguing that the “mere fact of paternity or maternity does not make a parent liable to third parties for the torts of his or her minor child”. But in adding their voices to the fight, Sabika’s family is ensuring that the gun violence and mass shootings that have become a tragically American phenomenon stay firmly in the international eye. “We trusted this country more than I think we should have,” said Shaheera Jalil Albasit, Sabika’s cousin. “We sent Sabika here as a guest. She was here on a cultural exchange, and she experienced the worst of the culture: the culture of gun violence.” Sabika arrived in the United States in August 2017 as a youth ambassador for the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Program. It was her first solo trip, and it was to be the longest amount of time she was to be away from her family, her cousin said. She was placed with a host family in Santa Fe, Texas, 30 miles from central Houston. She enrolled in Santa Fe high school, and experienced typical American teenage life, dressing up for Halloween, going to prom with friends, volunteering at the library, and keeping score at high school baseball games. “She was really thinking of this opportunity as the step a woman would take to show people that girls can travel alone, make friends across religions, across cultures, and do great things,” Albasit said. “I think that was her aspiration, coming back and sharing stories about what she did here. She was also excited about sharing the positives about Pakistan.” Though Sabika loved her time in Texas and grew close with her host family, she was, in the last few weeks, “really missing home”, Albasit said. “She kept talking about going home to her mother, and going home. She started a countdown. Every day, she’d send a message home to Pakistan.” On 18 May, Sabika posted one last Snapchat story: just 19 more days. At 7.30am, the shooter, a fellow student, walked into the four-room arts complex and opened fire, killing eight teenagers and two teachers. Thirteen others were injured, some seriously. According to court documents, Sabika and her classmates ran into a supply closet, where she hid behind a dresser. “The shooter … began shooting into the closets,” the filing reads. “He taunted the students who were hiding while he shot at them.” Sabika sustained nine gunshot wounds. The suspect, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, was arrested and charged with capital murder but cannot face the death penalty because of his age. Antonios Pagourtzis and Rose Marie Kosmetatos “knew that something was gravely wrong with their son”, but took no steps to get him help or prevent him from accessing firearms, the lawsuit alleges. The shooter had a fascination with the Columbine shooting, and went out of his way to dress like the shooters: wearing a full-length black trench coat and combat boots to school – even in the Texas heat. He was also fascinated by guns, in particular guns used by the Nazis in the second world war. On Facebook, he posted an image of a jacket with Nazi and fascist insignia, as well as artwork inspired by an electronic musician with a following among neo-Nazi groups. The day after the shooting, the family said in a statement they were “as shocked and confused as anyone else”. “While we remain mostly in the dark about the specifics of yesterday’s tragedy, what we have learned from media reports seems incompatible with the boy we love,” the statement read. “We share the public’s hunger for answers as to why this happened, and will await the outcome of the investigation before speaking about these events.” Sabika’s family, who are represented by the gun policy reform group Everytown for Gun Safety, hopes the suit will force accountability on not just gun owners, but on people who ignore warning signs in their loved ones, even though they know of the risk they might pose to others. “We believe that the shooter’s parents had multiple opportunities to stop what had happened, and they did not engage in anything,” Albasit said. “The motivation behind this lawsuit is that any gun owner in the US must feel an obligation when it comes to their weapons, not just in storing them safely, but in speaking up when they believe that someone around them is at risk of harming themselves or people around them.” Sabika’s parents never imagined that anything like this could happen, her father, Abdul Aziz, said in a phone interview from Pakistan. “How can a parent even think about their child being injured or hurt or taken away forever?” he asked. “It’s a very specifically American problem, this gun violence. But any manifestation of violence, especially targeted at children, should not be a reality. Children should not be stopped from pursuing education, no matter the reality. The reality must be corrected.” Farah Naz, Sabika’s mother, said: “It’s a very dark place to be for the family.” The sole light in that darkness, she said, is the duty they feel to deliver justice for their daughter. “We feel that we are accountable to Sabika every single day. We see her face in front of our eyes every day. Her voice, her sound, her laughter echo in our ears every day.” Sabika wanted to be an entrepreneur and a diplomat. One of the last things she wrote to her mother was that she had “amazing daughters who will make you proud”. Sabika’s mother now mourns for the future that one amazing daughter will never have. Sabika’s parents speak Urdu, and the phone interview was conducted through a translator. But when asked what it was about his daughter that he missed the most, Abdul Aziz answered immediately in English. “Everything,” he said. “Everything. Everything.”",2018-11-28 12:12:00,'We trusted this country': family of Pakistani teen killed in Texas shooting join lawsuit,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

11.28.2018 2:35 PM A college in Michigan thinks the best way for students and professors to defend themselves in the event of a mass shooting might be to throw hockey pucks at the gunman. To that end, Oakland University's faculty union purchased 800 pucks for professors and 1,700 for students, according to NPR. Oakland Police Chief Mark Gordon described the hockey pucks as a ""spur-of-the-moment idea that seemed to have some merit to it."" I am skeptical that anyone could effectively wield a hockey puck against a heavily armed intruder, but you never know. Ideally, people who are concerned about gun-wielding maniacs would be able to defend themselves with, well, guns—but Oakland is a gun-free zone. In the event that an armed maniac decided to target the university, he probably would not be deterred by the revelation that he's technically prohibited from bringing weapons onto the campus, which is why the logic of gun-free zones doesn't make a lot of sense. Maybe knowing he'd be pelted with hockey pucks is a minor disincentive, though. In truth, neither students nor their professors should be unreasonably fearful about a mass shooting taking place on their campus. Despite all the media attention paid to the issue, schools are not especially dangerous places, and mass-casualty events are extremely, blessedly rare. In all likelihood, Oakland students will have to find other uses for their new pucks.

I assume you, as a Canadian, can tell us the likelihood of a hockey puck fending off a polar bear attack. Hey, a puck to the face is no joke. Ask Cam Fowler. http://www.sportingnews.com/ca…..a68pd0ddgs Are they issuing hockey sticks too, and putting the whole campus on ice? I want to see this in a movie, a shooter on ice being zinged all over the rink, backwards. I see a new market opportunity here! Make yourselves some hand grenades, but package them to make them look like hockey pucks! Now sell them to the students and professors, and THEN they might have a fighting chance! Isn’t every 6th Canadian a goalie and issued a complete set of puck-proof armor by the Canadian government? I can only assume that such weaponry would have to be regulated lest it fall into the hands of a mad man. It’s Michigan, so as long as students aren’t prohibited from wielding hockey sticks they might have a chance. A well-placed slap shot could do make a gunman drop his gun while searching for his teeth. (Or maybe a backhander, if your birthday is 8/7/87.) Why not just paint a blue line around the campus? TWO LINE OFFSIDE PASS! Throwing hockey pucks at a shooter is not the way to stop him. The best way to stop a shooter is through love, toleration and understanding. Instead of throwing something that is hard, dangerous and unwelcoming, people should welcome the shooter with flowers, a card from Hallmark, a box of chocolates a hug. This way the shooter is shamed and will recognize his actions are a vain attempt to express himself verbally and will put down his gun, take up macrame and start to sing folk songs by Joan Baez. Violence is not the answer when confronting a deranged and dangerous mass murderer with a gun. Love is the answer. Just make sure you have a will made out to tell the inept authorities where you want to be buried. This makes me want to pick up a gun. !!! :)) As a Canadian let me be the first to say…. CULTUAL APPROPRIATION! DON’T USE MY CULTURE TO PROTECT YOURSELVES! Now I’m all triggered. Couldn’t the hockey pucks be used by angry students or faculty to injure or kill others? Aren’t you just giving people another, albeit less effective, alternative to a gun or a knife? “I am skeptical that anyone could effectively wield a hockey puck against a heavily armed intruder, but you never know. Ideally, people who are concerned about gun-wielding maniacs would be able to defend themselves with, well, guns” That’s because it’s not effective and it’s a stupid fucken idea dreamed up by naifs, knaves and fools. There’s only ONE way to effectively use a puck and that’s to slap the shit out of it. So unless these jokers get a sheet of ice and begin to slap at an intruder, they may want to rethink this ‘idea’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWnEmDeKqSg “There’s only ONE way to effectively use a puck and that’s to slap the shit out of it” That’s also the only way to effectively… I’ma stop right here. lol. The only way to effectively use MY ASS! So what you’re saying is we should coat the entire university grounds, inside and out, with ice? Yes. If you want this idea to work. /everyone in boardroom looks on stupefied. It is just north of Detroit. That is true for most of the school year. Most libtards are whiny, weak, little pansies. I doubt they could throw a puck hard enough to do any damage, or even reach the target. But at least shooters now know Oakland Uni is easy pickings, so … congrats? “HEY HEY HO HO MASS SHOOTERS GOT TO GO! RACIST SEXIST ANTI-GAY . . . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HEY HO YOUR ATTITUDE HAS GOT TO GO! HEY! HO! LET’S GO! HEY! HO! LET’S GO! Where are we going? It’s unfortunate that the NRA and its bought-and-paid-for Republican allies have reduced schools to the hockey puck defense strategy. But until Democrats control the entire federal government, common sense gun safety legislation faces an uphill battle. By 2021 when a Democrat is back in the White House we’ll get a nationwide ban on deadly assault weapons, which have no legitimate civilian use and are intended for the military and police. And as Reason commenter Michael Hihn has repeatedly shown, an assault weapon ban does not violate the Constitution in any way. In fact this country had such a ban a couple decades ago that research proves worked amazingly well. (Predictably, the NRA and Republicans prevented it from being renewed.) And as Reason commenter Michael Hihn has repeatedly shown LOL you had to go there, didn’t you? OBL is possibly the finest troll it has ever been my privilege to witness. Truly the TrollGawd. Its just diabolical, isn’t it? Diabolical? Far from it. Making the vanquished feel better about losing America’s culture war, even temporarily, can be seen as providing humanitarian aid to the hopeless and lost among us. “Vanquished” LOL. Yeah I wish I was a big winner like inner city Democrats, stuck in poverty for forever. >>>And as Reason commenter Michael Hihn has repeatedly shown you fucking slay me dude. This is a gross misrepresentation of Michael Hihn. As hockey pucks did not exist in 1789, clearly they cannot be used in self defense. IN COMMON USE AT THE TIME!!!!!!1 slow clap joins slow clap rises to feet Obviously Big Hockey got to the Oakland University purchasing dept. alternative – Trumps tariffs on Canada included sports equipment because National Defense and to get around this the cleaver free marketers just reclassified hockey pucks as an anti-terror devices. The whole thing sounds like a goatfuck of the Mongolian persuasion, but the bit that has me most skeptical is how the faculty got half the number of pucks given to the students. This implies that either there is one faculty member for every two students or they armed the faculty more heavily than the general population. Each of those conclusions is ludicrous in its own special way and NONE of it encourages me to want to visit Michigan or send anyone I give a damn about to visit what is obviously a hive of scum and stupidity. Seriously, what the actual fuck? Well, if it’s a STATE school, there’re the teachers, the administrators, the secretaries, the various maintenance crew, the … I can believe there is one school employee for every two students. When you don’t have to compete, it’s simple to throw on the overhead until it would crush any private enterprise. Sometimes it even becomes necessary, as you scramble for time to satisfy some higher authority’s demand for paperwork, (to justify its own existence and staffing levels.) Think of the innocent bystanders drilled by poorly aimed pucks. Worse than a Stooges pie throwing scene. For puck’s sake. Dumb pucks. And it can happen! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUbn5ss8j9c Onion? You wish. I honestly cannot tell the difference any more, which sort of make the Onion no longer relevant [as they cannot be discerned from actual “news”]. >>>You wish. I do. story is fubar. Prior article says college costs, in terms of real dollars, has increased by more than 50% since the 1960s. So let’s add defensive hockey pucks to diversity and inclusion, and putting a stop to rape culture. Throwing an object at someone is still offensive. The real intent is for students to fashion their own hockey puck – based body armor. This shows why e-books are a bad idea. A nice four pound textbook would be more effective than a hockey puck. The tactical theory is that a hail of any object thrown at a shooter as soon as she enters the classroom will distract long enough to tackle and disarm the evil one. In reality, only ROTC students will go to the sound of the guns. The best tactic is to unholster your semi-automatic pistol and put two in the chest and one in the head. Next best, if you were silly enough to enroll in an allegedly gun free institution, is to grab one of the more obnoxious snowflakes and us them as a shield to get out of a back door or a window if on a low floor. It’s funny that they expect the students to able to fight effectively with an improvised weapon, while the typical university works 24/7 to remove the mindset required to even give it a good try. Somebody who has to run to a “safe space” due to being addressed by the “wrong” pronoun doesn’t strike me as likely to be successful in this endeavor. But they do make good shields – – – – – – They will not resist, and scream loud enough to be an excellent distraction. Quick, Sidney, stab him with a crayon! Stab him with a crayon! But not a crayon that is of an offensive color? In reality, only ROTC students will go to the sound of the guns. The whole notion relies on an element of surprise which is often held/controlled by the shooter. After he/she fires the first shot, they’re likely going to expect violence, carnage, and flying debris. Not at all. A Kindle is MUCH cheaper than a college textbook. If you trash your kindle, by throwing it at your attacker, you can just log on to Amazon, buy a new one, (for ONLY a couple hundred, or less, depending on features,) and transfer all your EXPEN$IVE textbooks from your trashed unit to your new one. The only real problem here is Amazon makes Kindles that aren’t heavy enough for this sort of alternate use. This is obviously sexist because women, gays and trans throw like girls. Wearing hockey masks or pads during the commission of a crime is now a felony? If administrators believe hockey pucks are effective against active shooters, why don’t they consider them threatening to students and faculty? Sensible hockey puck control now! I could seriously see them requiring the pucks to be kept locked up in a special locker. That’s what they did in that school district (don’t remember which ones) that equipped classrooms with those little novelty baseball bats typically handed out as souvenirs. >>>Sensible hockey puck control now! Ron Hextall on line 2. Joel Quenville on line 3. Todd McClellan on line 4. conceal carry hockey puck permit, or is that a hockey puck in your pocket or a can of tobacco, or how about this where did i put that hockey puck i was supposed to save to defend my self with or ……………. Count on a university professor to come up with something this stupid. Only someone with no experience in the real world could think of such a thing. I swear, the scene in Back To School where Rodney Dangerfield corrects the stuffy business professor is practically a documentary, rather than humorous fiction. Academics are almost as stupid and clueless as Hollywood celebrities. That’s why they’re all progressives. We can deter mass shooters by arming the students and faculty…with something ridiculous. Locally. Deter mass shooters by being on the lookout for persons expressing intent or motive. A parent and a mental health adviser identified two boys who admitted at trial that they were planning to out do the Columbine bodycount by studying the mistakes of Klebold and Harris. Just after Parkland, a guy who had graduated school threatened to come back and shoot it up. Someone who heard the threat reported it. Deter mass shooters by denying them the opportunity to act. One our post-Parkland walkouts told the paper he was concerned that while only students and teachers with swipe cards could get past the secure doors, some doors were being left unsecured for convenience of outside contractors. Deter mass shooters by providing armed security (police or trained faculty). We put School Resource Officers in the high schools in 1997. Caroline Gudger stopped an armed man holding a pistol on a principal. Our SROs are not just armed guards; they conduct public safety programs. When Sean Cornett passed away on vacation the staff and students were devastated. But hockey pucks? That’s about as useful in actually deterring bad or crazy acts by bad or crazy people as a piece of paper in Washington saying ArmaLite Model 15 ist verboten. At least they could have given the students something useful. Hard to make a beer bong out of a hockey puck. Wouldn’t Shuriken throwing stars be more effective? Throw a hockey puck at a mass shooter? Definite game misconduct, probably fined by the league, suspended… In hockey puck vs gun I will bet on the gun every time. And I will be the winner most of the times. A hockey puck? Does nobody else here see the blatant racism of this? An apparatus from a game played by frozen white people won’t work for people of color. They will just be confused and think it is an echo dot, but the bitch won’t talk. Very sad. POC may throw yo-yos or boomerangs or spears. I once was following a semi-truck at night and eventually I realized that I was seeing a regular momentary flash of white under the mud flap on the right side dual rear wheels. No sooner had my mind processed that a rock must be wedged between the two tires than the rock shot out at 65 mph straight through the middle of my windshield 7-10″ from my face and right out through the back window–two neat holes, about 5 inches in diameter! Now, if a sports implement could be a weapon, I would bet on a baseball pitching machine (a true big league machine, not the slowed down models used in batting cages.) Then soak a bunch of baseballs in water and freeze them. When you have a target, set the pitching machine at 100 mph and dump a bunch of frozen hard balls in the hopper. Each classroom should have something like a machine gun nest or turret for the protection of the operator. Don’t bring a hockey puck to a gun fight. “Don’t bring a hockey puck to a gun fight.” Damn! I searched the entire thread, and you are the only one to beat me to it! If hockey pucks are sufficiently dangerous that they make a good counter to a crazy person with a gun, then existing weapons laws for school campuses and school events would ban pucks as well — including from school hockey games. If the idea of gun-free zones is to exclude weapons, then why provide weapons? At what point of effectiveness of weapons would they draw the line? Swords? Flechettes? Mauls? “If the idea of gun-free zones is to exclude weapons . . . . ” Not weapons, just guns. Guns are the only weapon capable of climbing out of a holster on its own and mowing down an entire campus. To quote Heinlein, “there is no such thing as a dangerous weapon, there are only dangerous men.” Way to let the cat out of the bag, Oakland U. Thanks to you, it just became illegal to possess hockey pucks in London. “No one has any reason to carry a hockey puck.” ? Mayor Sadiq Khan This reminds me of the old Canadian proverb: “They only thing that stops a bad gun with a gun is a good guy with 800 hockey pucks…eh?” A hockey puck is no match for a man wielding a goalie mask…and a machete! When hockey pucks are outlawed, only outlaws will have hockey pucks. But are the pucks make from imperialist rubber plantations in South America? My son plays hockey. Any student not needing the pucks can send them to me for his teams practices. Why not staplers? Why not Golf balls? Why not 30 round magazines? Why not straws? Why not poptarts? Hmm. Two posts up, but the third not. Repeating. I predict that these things will be used, not to stop an attacker with a gun, but to stone some outed conservative who dared to step foot within pitching distance of campus. I also predict many broken windows on cars with Trump bumper stickers. Given the actual rarity of school shootings, the proliferation of hockey pucks carried on the person as weapons may be a bad idea.. I don’t know what hockey puck thought THAT idea up, but while you guys are puckin’ around, I think I’d rather remove my .308 from under my shirt and see if I couldn’t maybe contribute to your tomorrows…… I essentially started three weeks past and that i makes $385 benefit $135 to $a hundred and fifty consistently simply by working at the internet from domestic.

30,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/nra-money-executive-perks-pay-cutting-costs/,"NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierreOlivier Douliery/AP The National Rifle Association paid more than $100,000 in personal expenses for an official who is now leading an austerity campaign within the organization, new tax filings show. The official, Josh Powell, is the NRA’s executive director for general operations. The Trace and Mother Jones reported two weeks ago that Powell, along with the NRA’s new treasurer, Craig Spray, is seeking to impose steep cuts to the gun group’s budget. The effort is so stringent that the NRA did away with free coffee and water coolers in its Fairfax headquarters, causing consternation among NRA staffers. On Wednesday, NRATV staffer Cameron Gray announced on Twitter that he and “several colleagues” had been laid off. https://twitter.com/Cameron_Gray/status/1067841952727601152 According to the NRA’s latest tax filing, released earlier this month, Powell’s total compensation for 2017 was almost $800,000. Of that, the records say, $102,484 took the form of “taxable personal expenses.” Another executive, Todd Grable, generated more than $132,000 in expenses, the documents show. The filings do not specify the type of personal expenses that were paid, but an NRA spokesperson told The Trace that it provides “corporate living arrangements” for Powell “so that he may maintain a home near headquarters and address the personal living needs of his family in Michigan.” (The returns disclose for the first time that the NRA pays housing costs for a total of four unnamed executives.) A Trace investigation into Powell’s business history published last month revealed a long trail of defaulted debts, including 20 lawsuits for more than $400,000 from unpaid vendors. It is not unheard of for companies or nonprofits to pay some personal expenses—car payments, housing, travel—of sought-after executives. But experts say the scale of expenses covered for Powell and Grable is highly unusual. Previous NRA tax returns have not disclosed what, if any, portion of executive compensation was reimbursement for personal expenses. “The fact that the NRA made no effort to argue that they were work-related personal expenses means they really were personal,” said Marc Owens, a former head of the IRS division overseeing tax exempt enterprises. “It’s truly unusual that an executive from a nonprofit would be able to command that sort of additional income. It’s a very large amount, and an extraordinary admission.” The NRA’s 2017 tax filings contain much more detail than they have in for prior years, laying bare financial arrangements and transactions that had previously been opaque. One puzzling disclosure regards the compensation of a former executive, Michael Marcellin, who was the NRA’s managing director of affinity and licensing. Marcellin’s duties included managing special offers for members, such as insurance products like the controversial Carry Guard program, which sparked multiple investigations from state insurance regulators, including New York and Washington. Carry Guard was administered by a firm called Lockton Affinity, which split revenue from the product with the NRA. Lockton cut ties with the NRA after February’s mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, and the two faced off in a (since settled) lawsuit. The 2017 tax returns identify Marcellin as a “former” employee, yet they indicate that he received a base salary of  $522,426 from the group last year. Supplemental notes, however, say that he received precisely the same amount — $522,426 — from “an unrelated organization, Lockton Affinity LLC.” The notes also say Marcellin received $455,000 from Lockton in 2016, a detail that was “inadvertently excluded” from the prior year’s tax records. In 2016, Marcellin was still a fulltime NRA employee, earning a total of nearly $630,000, according to that year’s filing. Three nonprofit tax law experts consulted by the Trace said they could not fathom why the income was paid by Lockton, or why it was disclosed by the NRA. “I don’t know why they’re reporting that,” said Philip Hackney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law School who specializes in nonprofits. “It wouldn’t seem to fit, since it’s not a related organization, so you wouldn’t put that in. But they put it in. Reporting unrelated entity income is more than a belt and suspenders approach.” Marcellin did not return a message seeking comment. A spokesman for the office of the Washington state insurance commissioner, which has been investigating Carry Guard, told us, “Washington insurance law does not allow compensation to an NRA employee for soliciting, selling or negotiating coverage,” but that the payments would be legal if they were reimbursements for other services. Other disclosures in the returns include a $32,000 payment to board member and former president David Keene, who has been closely associated with the alleged Russian spy Maria Butina. Keene visited Moscow in 2013 to attend the annual meeting of a pro-gun group founded by Butina, and has been a longtime associate of Butina’s boyfriend, Paul Erickson. Reached by a reporter, Keene said only, “I don’t talk to The Trace. Merry Christmas.” An NRA spokesperson declined to explain the payments to Marcellin, saying only that he “has obviously been a long-time supporter of the NRA. We appreciate his ongoing partnership and support on many fronts.” He said that Keene had been paid a “nominal compensation” for representing the NRA at public events. The filings come at a time when the organization finds itself, by its own admission, in a precarious financial state. Last year, total revenue fell by almost $55 million, and yet overall executive compensation increased by $1.2 million. The NRA recently rolled out its second dues increase in two years, and has claimed that regulatory efforts in New York against its Carry Guard insurance program have cost the gun group “tens of millions of dollars” in lost income, legal fees, and other damages. As it has in previous tax returns, the NRA disclosed that in 2017 it paid its longtime PR firm, the Oklahoma-based Ackerman McQueen, just over $20 million for “public relations and advertising.” But this year, in supplemental notes, the NRA noted that the true amount paid to Ackerman McQueen was nearly twice that, including more than $11 million for “media, outside vendor costs, and reimbursement of travel and business expenses;” $5,588,945 to Ackerman McQueen’s Washington, D.C., office, which operates under the name Mercury Group; $2.5 million paid by the NRA’s affiliated foundation; and $2,635,000 paid to an Ackerman-related production company called Under Wild Skies. For decades, some NRA employees have complained that Ackerman McQueen consumes too much of the NRA’s budget. The firm strongly influences much of the NRA’s incendiary messaging, and produces various programs that appear on NRATV. Ackerman’s website calls the Mercury Group a “subsidiary specializing in public relations and crisis communication.” Mercury’s president is Tony Makris, who is also the president of Under Wild Skies, which is also the title of a hunting show hosted by Makris that appears on NRATV. Corporate records show that, through 2017, the treasurer of Under Wild Skies was Tyler Schropp, the executive director of the NRA’s office of advancement, a position he has held since 2010. Before that, Schropp was an executive vice president at Mercury Group. The return also provides new details about the NRA’s conflict-of-interest policy. Previous returns merely stated that the group “takes conflicts of interest very seriously” and that conflicts are reviewed by the office of the secretary and general counsel. The latest return describes the process for identifying conflicts, and the procedure for adjudicating them. Experts say that the NRA’s motivation for the newfound transparency on its tax returns might not have anything to do with the IRS. “I don’t think there’s anything in here that would have triggered anything with the IRS,” says Hackney. “It doesn’t strike me that this is for IRS eyes. The conflict of interest policy — conflict issues are something that a state attorney general would go after. Maybe they were anticipating the Democrats taking the House, so they’re coming clean with some of this stuff now.” Asked if the NRA was the subject of any state or IRS investigations, the spokesperson said: “As has been publicly reported, the NRA is cooperating with an inquiry from the New York State Department of Financial Services and certain other state regulators. With respect to questions about our tax filings, the NRA has always operated in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations — and will continue to do so. We determined that we would provide additional information in our 2017 990s — in an effort to offer greater visibility into the dealings of the association and its foundation. The fact remains that the NRA’s finances have long been an open book and a matter of public record.” (Mother Jones and the Trace have teamed up to further investigate the NRA’s finances and political activity.

32,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/us/politics/trump-bump-stock-ban.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Katie Rogers WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is preparing to officially ban bump stocks on guns, a move that would put an end to the sale of attachments that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire faster and that would follow through on an order President Trump made this year to the Justice Department to regulate the devices. An administration official said on Wednesday evening that a formal ban will be rolled out in the coming days to weeks, a timeline first reported by CNN. Mr. Trump, who has in recent weeks hinted that the ban would be coming, first called for the Justice Department to re-examine the regulations after a mass shooting in February at a Florida high school left 17 dead. The president’s declaration set into motion a chain of events that surprised officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which had already been tasked with reviewing whether the devices could be banned, a directive given after a massacre in Las Vegas in October 2017. In that mass shooting, the deadliest in modern history, a gunman using weapons outfitted with a bump stock device killed 58 people. The gunman  fired off about 90 rounds in 10 seconds. As recently as last month, Mr. Trump said publicly that a ban would be coming. “So we’re knocking out bump stocks,” the president said during a news conference announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada. “I’ve told the N.R.A. I’ve told them: Bump stocks are gone.” He added: “And over the next couple of weeks, I’ll be able to write it up.” The initiative to ban bump stocks had been met with skepticism by Democratic lawmakers in Congress, who questioned whether the measure would be enough to combat the scourge of mass shootings. (The device was not used in the shooting in Florida, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.) The move also drew caution from lawmakers who said taking executive action on the devices could lead to court battles. The National Rifle Association did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday evening, but the organization initially supported an A.T.F. review of the devices after the Las Vegas shooting. At the same time, the gun association had also urged Congress to pass a law that would allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry the weapons in all 50 states. Though he has worked to push through a ban on bump stocks, Mr. Trump remains a vocal supporter of gun rights and the Second Amendment, frequently invoking it as under assault by Democrats.

33,https://splinternews.com/trump-administration-will-finally-ban-bump-stocks-1830729160,"The Trump administration will move to ban bump stocks in the coming days, sources tell CNN. The new federal rule will outlaw the attachments that make semi-automatic guns fully automatic. Trump promised to ban the gun attachments last year after the Las Vegas mass shooting, in which one gunman killed 58 people and shot over 400. It was found that the shooter, Stephen Paddock, had altered AR-15 rifles with bump stocks that allowed them to mimic fully automatic guns. From CNN: The devices make it easier to fire rounds from a semi-automatic weapon by harnessing the gun’s recoil to “bump” the trigger faster — an operation that caused officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives during the Obama administration to conclude that it’s merely a gun accessory or firearm part, not subject to federal regulation. At Trump’s direction, however, the Justice Department submitted a proposed final rule earlier this year that upended the Obama-era interpretation, and concluded that bump-fire stocks, “slide-fire” devices, and devices with certain similar characteristics all fall within the prohibition on machine guns by allowing a “shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger,” and therefore, they are illegal under federal law. Trump’s new federal ban would give those who own the accessories 90 days to either destroy them or turn them in to authorities. “Bump stocks turn semiautomatic guns into illegal machine guns. This final rule sends a clear message: Illegal guns have no place in a law-and-order society, and we will continue to vigorously enforce the law to keep these illegal weapons off the street,” a senior Justice Department official told CNN. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and others have warned that the ban may elicit court challenges that would prevent it from being effective. The National Rifle Association hasn’t publicly reacted to the possibility of a new ban. After the Las Vegas shooting, an NRA spokesperson said that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives “should review bump-fire stocks to ensure they comply with federal law,” while pushing back on broader gun control measures.",2018-11-28 21:15:00,"The Trump Administration Will Finally Ban Bump Stocks, Sources Say",,4469,http://gizmodo.com

Anonymous U.S. officials told CNN Wednesday a formal ban on the devices will be announced in the coming days. Bump stocks got the nation's attention after the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas. Authorities say the gunman used weapons rigged with devices during the attack, which left 58 people dead and hundreds more injured. When attached to a weapon, the device replaces the shoulder rest and adds a small piece near the trigger. This allows the firearm to slide back and forth and harness the recoil power of every shot. The shooter doesn't have to move the trigger finger to fire. Instead, they just have to pull forward on the barrel of the gun. The weapon quickly ""bumps"" between the shooter's shoulder and finger, firing the weapon much faster than a human could. A few months after the Las Vegas attack, the Justice Department submitted a regulation proposal that would classify bump-stock-type devices as machine guns and bar the possession, sale and manufacturing of the gun accessory. Since the Las Vegas shooting, 11 states have banned bump stocks. The White House has yet to comment on CNN's report. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

11.29.2018 10:25 AM Bump stocks are modifications that can be attached to a rifle to increase the rate of fire, often at the expense of accuracy. Nine months after President Donald Trump endorsed a ban on the devices, the administration appears to be on the verge of banning them. CNN was the first to report the news yesterday evening, citing ""officials familiar with the matter."" An administration official confirmed to The New York Times that the rule would be unveiled ""in the coming days to weeks."" Under Trump's new regulation, a source tells CNN, bump stock owners would have 90 days to get rid of the devices on their own or turn them over to authorities. The issue first rose (temporarily) to the forefront of the national conversation after the October 2017 Las Vegas shooting, where a gunman used such devices as he killed 58 people. In February 2018, another mass shooting occurred, this one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Though the shooter did not use a bump stock, Trump announced in the aftermath of the tragedy that he would be banning the accessories, directing then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions ""to propose regulations that ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns."" In the following months, Trump continued signaling his intention to make bump stocks illegal. ""So we're knocking out bump stocks,"" the president said in October. ""And we are in the final couple of weeks."" The administration probably doesn't have the legal authority to do this. Under federal law, a machine gun is defined as ""any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger."" But a gun equipped with a bump stock is still able only to fire just one round per trigger pull. ""Instead of squeezing the trigger, the shooter holds his trigger finger steady while pushing the barrel forward with his other hand, thereby firing a round,"" Reason's Jacob Sullum explains. ""The recoil repositions the trigger, and continuing to exert forward pressure on the barrel makes the rifle fire repeatedly."" As Reason's Christian Britschgi explained in March, this is probably why the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has said multiple times that federal restrictions on machine guns do not cover bump stocks. The Obama administration affirmed the legality of bump stocks on three different occasions: once in 2010, again in 2012, and once more in 2013. As Sen. Diane Feinstein (D–Calif.) said in a February statement: The ATF ""currently lacks authority under the law to ban bump stocks."" In addition to being legally questionable, a bump stock ban probably wouldn't do very much. No mass shooters before or after Las Vegas have used bump stocks to carry out their massacres. Even in Las Vegas, the death toll wasn't necessarily higher because the shooter used one. Most gun enthusiasts have little need for bump stocks. So they're a relatively easy target for those who want more gun control, and a relatively easy sacrifice for gun rights advocates. Hence the reportedly pending ban. As Britschgi argued in October 2017: ""Banning bump stocks is something that can be done without pissing too many people off, placating the crowd that after every shooting in America screams for somebody to do something.""

Both the left and right will find a way to spin this to fit their preferred team’s politics. As Britschgi argued in October 2017: “Banning bump stocks is something that can be done without pissing too many people off, placating the crowd that after every shooting in America screams for somebody to do something.” It’s naive to think that this or any other gun control measure short of a total ban will “placate” the antigun crowd. The UK is the prime model. Now the cops go on weapons sweeps confiscating everyone’s butter knives. And I’m not exaggerating. As long as they don’t touch my margarine knives, I’m cool. Waiting for LC1789 to come here and breathlessly tell us all how Trump is the most libertarian of all presidents. He’s probably in gym class right now. Does anybody else want to smell lc1789’s sweaty gym clothes? The smell of a pubescent boy after a period of physical exertion is heavenly. Trump or LC1789? I’m waiting for him to come in and beat the crap out of you vexatious morons for the thousandth time. And I doubt he supports the bump stock ban. But then, people like him are capable of independent thought separate from political dogma, or or soft headed, emotional, sophist thinking. Solid satire. No, he is that crazy. Often worse. What will be the penalty for hooking your thumb in your belt loop and bump firing from the hip? Or simply bump firing from the shoulder without using a belt loop? I see no indication there would be. How would THAT cause your gun to fire dozens of shots in a few seconds? A bump stock ban is meaningless because unless it is a law passed by Congress is only applies to the definition from the ATF. The ATF can restrict the sale of bump stocks like it does suppressors but Congress is the only entity that can ban them by passing a law. Congress is supposed to be the only branch to levy taxes and tariffs as well. How is that working? Are they coming after rubber bands next? Shoelaces and keyrings. The BATFE has already rule that a shoelace is a machine gun, although they later changed their minds. Let’s just cut to the chase and outlaw murder. No, that’s not nearly enough. We need to outlaw hate thoughts! Redrum! Redrum! No murder? Fuck off, slaver. …after the October 2017 Las Vegas shooting, where a gunman used such devices as he killed 58 people. There was a mass shooting in Las Vegas? There was a mass shooting in Las Vegas? Well, Sparky, only the worst mass shooting in US history I could probably become a billionaire, if I launch a website where nobody can post unless they have an IQ above 75, and can prove they are not totally ignorant of recent major news events. If nothing else, that would eliminate 77.3% of the commenters here. As would I, if I could develop a sarcasm detector that didn’t require repeated recalibration. #MAGA #(M)y(A)llegiance(G)overnment(A)dulation Trump’s eleventy-dimensional chess to make Democrats oppose it. More likely, Trump will push it but doesn’t really care. It will get challenged in court. His administration will defend it weakly. It will be overturned and the precedent will be set. I’m not sure if that was the intention. It’s more likely a blind squirrel finding a nut. But it does seem likely to end up being a setback for Gun control advocates. >>>get rid of the devices on their own or turn them over to authorities. or what? Or you don’t. Don’t worry our pretty little heads about administrative overreach! The courts will overturn this regulation faster than you can say Jack Robinson. That will destroy the Republicans’ disingenuous efforts to duck this issue after the next “mass shooting.” Do we really think we can get 40 Senators to stand up against a proper bump stock ban statute at that point? And then it will be “legitimate.” Turn in your bump stocks, gentlemen. Next stop we revisit that Bush-era long-shoelace ban suggestion. Don’t worry our pretty little heads about administrative overreach! The courts will overturn this regulation faster than you can say Jack Robinson Scalia’s Heller ruling will be overturned by a conservative SCOTUS? Why did they refuse to overturn the Assault Weapons Ban (what it’s called) Then again, Obama is a Muslim from Kenya. And those space aliens in Roswell, New Mexico. Because that was a statute, Einstein. I didn’t say overturn it on 2A grounds. Cowardly diversion, Skippy, Read again what he quoted you saying, and then responded . I would have ridiculed your attempt to foment hysteria over a long shoelace ban “suggestion” that you pulled out of your ass, squeezing it around your head, Einstein. Only if someone is going to challenge it. As far as I can tell the bump stock makers have folded up shop. The NRA certainly isn’t going to file suit, they were on the bandwagon cheering this. So, it will become administrative “law”. You have to turn over your bump stocks. So anyone who owns one would have standing. I don’t have one. I also doubt that any individual is going to challenge it. That would cost a lot of money and I doubt that Gura (Heller etal) would pursue it, nor any of the gun rights organizations. I could be wrong of course. What role do you keep seeing a gun rights organization playing here at all? They typically are not plaintiffs themselves in gun-rights cases anyway, as they’re not normally the easiest party to demonstrate standing; they simply can pay legal expenses if necessary. All you need is a single person who wishes to keep his bump stock; and a law firm who wishes to work pro bono for the sake of the 2A, or a libertarian group, or gun rights group who opposes a bump stock ban (like the GOA). It’s not very hard to find any of that. gun rights orgs would bankroll the suit. that single person buy the way is going to likely have to be arrested first, convicted and then take his case thru the courts. you know ANY gun owner willing to do that? As I said, yes, a gun rights org, a libertarian org, or the law firm itself could bankroll the suit. All of which there are plenty who oppose bump stock bans. Also there are plenty of libertarians willing to get themselves arrested on principle. Some of them are big YouTube personalities. I think you could find a room’s worth in New Hampshire alone. Also all it would take is one bump stock owner to actually get convicted for possession, whether or not he planned it deliberately. Also since when would it even take that? What exactly were Heller or McDonald arrested for? (And which one was bankrolled by the NRA?) *or a generous individual Actually I take that back about the libertarians. It depends on the penalty. It will probably be pretty severe, so maybe not. Everything else stands. *libertarians being willing to go to prison for this Are YOU going to volunteer? Heller and MacDonald didn’t need to be arrested. They could apply for the license, be turned down and sue on that basis. Your hypothetical gun owner willing to risk becoming a Federal FELON (15 years in the pokey) over a toy is a much rarer commodity. The mfg’s had the financial incentive to sue to overturn the administrative “law” and I don’t see any indication they’re going to do so. But I’ll look forward to reading about YOUR pursuit of justice over bump stocks. First of all, I didn’t say ME. I am just a dude sitting at a keyboard; maybe I am a pussy. Second of all, I realized I made a mistake about that and took it back. Third of all, YOU are the one who imagines that one needs to be convicted to have standing in the first place. I have been disputing that from square one. Perhaps no bump stock owner will deliberately provoke a 15 year sentence over this. But as I explained, he will not need to. You think every single bump stock owner is now going to turn over his toy to the Feds? Or will some of them decide to roll the dice, the way every day countless Americans hold on to small personal drug stashes that risk them felony collars if the cops do decide to bust down their doors and search the place? Well, all it takes is one unlucky fellow to do that. Perhaps it’s stupid. So be it. (By the way how has that New York State SAFE Act registration compliance been going?) Second, suppose I did buy a bump stock. Now the ATF has announced a law saying I will have to hand over my property to the government before a certain date. I don’t want to do that, and I claim the law requiring me to do that is unconstitutional. Boom. Standing. It does not depend on any criminal penalty even existing; the loss of my property is sufficient. Maybe you can challenge the law without being arrested, maybe not. Maybe you can do this with very little money, maybe not. My response to you is based on the fact that YOU are ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN this will be overturned by the courts. My ire gets raised real fast by people who are ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN something will happen. I think it is far from certain, indeed much closer to the certain that it won’t be overturned by the courts because no individual is going to challenge it. I am sorry about your ire. I am quite confident nonetheless that some person in the United States of America will eventually be caught, or claimed to be caught, with a bump stock. And I am quite confident that having to hand over your private property to the government (or any other party) in accordance with a law gives you standing to challenge the law’s constitutionality. I don’t know what to say if this is not obvious to you. “The courts will overturn this regulation faster than you can say Jack Robinson.” “will eventually be caught, or claimed to be caught, with a bump stock.” You keep moving the goal posts. “And I am quite confident that having to hand over your private property to the government (or any other party) in accordance with a law gives you standing to challenge the law’s constitutionality” I’ve never said otherwise. Most of the people who have bought bump stocks are sophisticated gun owners who will likely know that they now have a prohibited item and will take great care to see that they are not caught with it. So, I think you’ll likely be able to say “jack robinson” a gazillion times before anyone gets a chance in court to challenge this “law”. And no individual is going to place themselves in the Federal cross-hairs over this on purpose. You keep moving the goal posts. No, I don’t. I acknowledge that it might take some time for someone to be caught with a bump stock. Not as much time as you believe, I think. I don’t care how “sophisticated gun owner” you are (let us put aside the bizarre claim that this describes “most of the people who bought bump stocks,” of all things), I do not know what sort of “great care” is going to keep you from “getting caught” with it when the police are executing a permissible search on whatever grounds. Why I don’t even know why we have any limitations on law enforcement searches at all; we could all just take “great care” with anything we desire. But all of this is superfluous to my argument… I’ve never said otherwise. And there you have it. If you acknowledge that anyone who owns a bump stock has standing to sue the government merely by virtue of its demand to turn over his property to them, then any speculation about the likelihood of the above is moot. I do not have to wait for a bump stock owner to be caught with a secret illegal bump stock, to see this case go to court. I merely need to wait for one to say, “I have a bump stock in my ownership and possession currently. I purchased it when it was legal to do so. You now propose to confiscate this legally obtained private property of mine, to demand that I turn it over to the government. I believe that I need not do that, that this demand by the federal police is illegal and not authorized by statute. Therefore I am suing to have this regulation overturned and keep my property.” There are no “Federal cross-hairs” to this action. It does not require that the individual be convicted or even be at risk of being convicted. No I do not believe it will take a long time to find a bump stock owner willing to take a stand like this. Fuck, a libertarian activist with no interest in bump stocks or even guns could find a bump stock owner planning to meekly turn over his property to the state, buy it instead from him, and file this lawsuit. And yes, there would be plenty willing to do it because again there would be no risk of criminal prosecution. Again, I’ve never said no one has standing. And yes, you could even theoretically sue based upon the case that you want to BUY one but can’t because it would be illegal and you challenge that, and so not be in any cross-hairs. My argument has always been that no individual is going to do that because it costs too much money. Why don’t you do it? You won’t? Point taken? If you don’t use it you are extremely likely to not “get caught”. It is possible of course that the Feds could/would get the sales and go looking for them. CA has done such. But I’m not so sure the Feds will go that far in this instance. Additionally, they are just substitute stocks for rifles, easy to take off and can be hidden away without great difficulty and the AR returned to normal functionality. I know someone who has 2 of them. And all he has to do is store them off his property and stay mum when/if the Feds come around (5th A and all that). No, I think the Feds know that this would be a pretty fruitless method of rounding them up. But let us suppose someone is stupid enough to “get caught”. That is not oh just give us the bump stock and be on your way you can fight us in court if you want it back. No, that is oh hey we’re putting you in JAIL for 15 years. Now you’ve got to fight just to get acquitted of a Federal Felony and that ain’t cheap. Sure you can throw out the Constitutionality defense but I’ll give you good odds the local Federal court is going to convict you. I wouldn’t want to bet 15 years on any jury. So after that you’re fighting an appeals process. A LOT more money. And, you are in jail. It isn’t going to be reversed faster than you can say “Jack Robinson”. No libertarian org would finance such a suit. We’re not so uneducated unalienable rights. No libertarian org would finance such a suit. We’re not so uneducated unalienable rights. The faggots at the NRA ASKED for this ban. The pussies at GOA have filed no suits, despite insisting they’re “No compromise.” Constitution? GOA has said that they’re going to file suit. They’ll win on a regulation and lose on a law. The bump stick increases firing speed to almost full automatic. And even semi-automatics may be banned, since 1939 nth dimension chess. Trump “bans” bump stocks. Courts toss the ban. Trump gets to have it all ways. He gets credit for a ban. He gets to lash out at the judiciary. The gun constituency doesn’t hate him as much because the ban was ineffective. And if he has to sacrifice a few pawns (Americans) so be it? Someone needs legal standing to sue which means they got fucked. So what’s the primary difference between the Obama-administration BATF and the Trump-administration BATF? I imagine that about 99% of the BATF employees in both cases are the exact same people and 99% of them don’t give a rat’s ass who’s nominally in charge, they know who really runs things at the BATF and it’s them. This doesn’t go nearly far enough. We need to ban deadly military style assault weapons. Related: David Hogg has another brilliant idea! Congress ought to create a federal tax on gun sales to fund gun violence research. Guns and ammo should be taxed at rates far higher than they are now. Partly to discourage people ? especially poor people ? from buying them, of course, but also because the additional research money will produce valuable results. For example, research shows the assault weapons ban of the 1990s was a smashing success, but the NRA’s influence kept it from being renewed. So once again these weapons of war are legal on our streets, and the results have been predictable. Related: David Hogg has another brilliant idea! LOL! You’ve really had your “A” game going lately! This doesn’t go nearly far enough. We need to ban deadly military style assault weapons. Or go much further. A ban on all semi-automatics has been constitutional since 1939, as reaffirmed by Scalia’s Heller ruling. Don’t forget (unless you already have) the NRA was totally powerless against the Assault Weapons Ban. The assault weapons ban of the 1990s was a smashing success, Only a small percentage were included, because of so many poliitcial exemptions but the NRA’s influence kept it from being renewed. Thanks for admitting they were powerless against it for 10 long years. because it was and is constitutional, right? If it were up to me we’d overturn Heller and recognize that the Second Amendment only protects a collective right. That’s why it refers to a “militia” after all. Of course I want to ban assault weapons, but that’s only the first step. The right to keep and bear arms is no more a collective right than freedom of speech, religion, the right of assembly, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, protection against double jeopardy, protection against self-incrimination, due process, trial by jury, right to confront one’s accusers, or right to an attorney are. The term militia is in the prefatory clause which describes the purpose of the amendment but doesn’t limit it to a collective right. Prior to the ratification of the US Constitution several states had amendments to their Constitutions describing the right to keep and bear arms as and individual right not dependent on service in a militia. MARYLAND (November 11, 1776) “That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state; and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.” Prior to the ratification of the US Constitution several states had amendments to their Constitutions describing the right to keep and bear arms as and individual right not dependent on service in a militia. Those state amendments were obsolete with adoption of the federal Constitution. Check the Supremacy Clause. And it was Scalia who reaffirmed the constitutionality of a ban on semi-automatics in Heller, since 1939, by noting the bans on “unusual and dangerous:” weapons at ratification. Those state amendments were obsolete with adoption of the federal Constitution. Check the Supremacy Clause. That’s not even how that works. Since a state constitution is binding only on that state, there is no reason that state constitutions can’t provide greater protections than the federal constitution, and many do. Granted, these protections are binding only on the state government and not the feds, but that does’t make them “obsolete”. And it was Scalia who reaffirmed the constitutionality of a ban on semi-automatics in Heller, since 1939, by noting the bans on “unusual and dangerous:” weapons at ratification. Semi-auto weapons been in common use for more that a century. They’ve been used by the military, police, hunters, target shooters and ordinary citizens seeking to protect themselves. They are neither unusual nor uniquely dangerous, and therefore clearly not open to a blanket ban. (Scalia’s language was unusually sloppy there. After all, a weapon that isn’t “dangerous” to at least some degree isn’t much of a weapon.) Since a state constitution is binding only on that state, there is no reason that state constitutions can’t provide greater protections than the federal constitution, The reasons are two. 1) If the Constitution forbids THAT protection to violate a different protection/right. Even if that right has not yet been acknowledged. (9A). 2) The Supremacy Clause but that doesn’t make them “obsolete”. The ones mentioned violate the Supremacy Clause. And it was Scalia who reaffirmed the constitutionality of a ban on semi-automatics in Heller, since 1939, by noting the bans on “unusual and dangerous:” weapons at ratification. Semi-auto weapons been in common use for more that a century. Non responsive. And wrong. The NRA (and anyone else) was totally powerless against the Assault Weapons Ban for 10 long years. It’s been constitutional since 1939 (Miller) They are neither unusual nor uniquely dangerous, and therefore clearly not open to a blanket ban. Irrelevant. Totally. They prove was the Founders intent was based on accepted practice at the time. — and that none of them were affected. (Scalia’s language was unusually sloppy there. On what authority? After all, a weapon that isn’t “dangerous” to at least some degree isn’t much of a weapon.) Look again at what I placed in quotation marks. Cont. There were also alternate versions of the Second Amendment that acknowledged that the right to keep and bear arms was an individual right. The Address and Reasons of Dissent of the Minority of the Convention of Pennsylvania To Their Constituents “That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or for the purpose of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes committed, or real danger of public injury from individuals; and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up: and that the military shall be kept under strict subordination to and be governed by the civil powers.” “The inhabitants of the several states shall have liberty to fowl and hunt in seasonable times, on the lands they hold, and on all other lands in the United States not inclosed, and in like manner to fish in all navigable waters, and others not private property, without being restrained therein by any laws to be passed by the legislature of the United States.” The people living at the time of ratification knew what the second amendment meant, they also knew that people would lie and distort it’s meaning: Samual Adams “The Constitution shall never be construed…to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.” A well-educated electorate, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed. Only the well-educated electorate have the right to keep and read books. Which means everyone not liberal. I’m okay with that. It’s not a collective right. The entire amendment is obsolete and should be repealed, It’s been a long time since we used as citizens militia to defend the security of a free state. duh Gun nuts scream about original intent except when it’s incon-vweeeeeen-yent. They’ve also been brainwashed to believe gun controls don’r save lives.. whereas we’ve had 31,000% more mass shootings than England in — I think it was the last 10 years. Gun nuts are easily manipulated, because they falsely believe gun ownership is an absolute right, when no rights are totally absolute, even life, because two absolute rights can be in conflict. Repeal and replace 2A, to assure self-defense as a right — which is unnecessary because it’s a fundamental right anyhow, most obviously under 9A. Okay, I think my head just imploded. You want to repeal the 2A to assure a right to self-defense? I can’t even begin to fathom the thought process behind that. We’re well into insane troll logic territory here. Let’s examine the idea with some real logic. Is there a right to life? I believe so, and you claim to. If there is, then a right to self-defense logically follows, since a right without a means to enforce it is meaningless. A right to self-defense logically implies a right to own and possess an effective means of self-defense. Otherwise, this right once again degenerates into meaningless rhetoric. As to what constitutes an effective means, that has obviously changed with time. Currently, guns represent the most effective means, but this wasn’t true in the past (when guns didn’t exist or weren’t reliable and widely available) and may not be true in the future (when someone invents something better). This is precisely why the founders used the generic term “arms” in the 2A. If you believe the 2A should be repealed, fine, argue for that. Don’t try to redefine it. Okay, I think my head just imploded Is that why you failed to read (or misunderstood) almost all of it? You want to repeal the 2A to assure a right to self-defense? I said the exact opposite. Is there a right to life? Of course. a right to self-defense logically follows, since a right without a means to enforce it is meaningless. See my final clause. A right to self-defense logically implies a right to own and possess an effective means of self-defense. So you agree it is NOT dependent on 2A, andis separate — and that final clause you missed explains why (which amendment applies) This is precisely why the founders used the generic term “arms” in the 2A. They were EXPLICIT about why – militia service.. And purpose — the security of the nation. We now use a professional army for that. And protected arms have been constitutionally defined as the modern equivalent of the weapons in common us at ratification, brought from home for ,militia service, (he militia clause) since 1939, affirmed by Scalia in Heller If you believe the 2A should be repealed, fine, argue for that. Don’t try to redefine it. Now read the THIRD sentence. We’re well into insane troll logic territory here. Anything else? (IF you read it.) Despite Scalia’s somewhat confusing Dicta Heller does not stand for that proposition. If and when the SC actually takes up the question of so-called “assault rifle” bans then we will get an answer to that question. I don’t think your confidence in the preferred answer is something you should be that sure of. Despite Scalia’s somewhat confusing Dicta Heller does not stand for that proposition. He EXPLICITLY defends it twice, in affirming the Limits in US v Miller (1939) If and when the SC actually takes up the question of so-called “assault rifle” bans then we will get an answer to that question. US v Miller (1939) I don’t think your confidence in the preferred answer is something you should be that sure of.You lose. Bad bluff. Read Heller. Must I tell you where? You’re the same one who says state constitutions are superior to the federal one. So also read the Constitution. Article VI, Clause 2 Any questions? Only one question: how long did you study? Because, seriously, no one is born this stupid. Also, close your damn tags! no one is born this stupid. Bend over. This will go in and up with less pain. Then see my response to AZ Gunowner Quote the language where he EXPLICITLY defends “it”. Yes, PLEASE tell me where. (Scaia on precedent) 1(f). United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174 (1939), does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes Scalia’s Heller We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. ‘Miller’ said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those ‘in common use at the time.‘ We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of ‘dangerous and unusual weapons.'” …. as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment’s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty….. But the fact that modern developments have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right. “At the time” means at ratification. As does bans on “dangerous and unusual weapons” Any questions Good examples of reading words and assigning different meanings to them. Be more specific. so I can drop-kick your pathetic ass again. The conclusion is obvious. There’s no reason to buy a bump stock, since — if this is correct, they can’t shoot any faster. But this is misleading, since the bump stock increases the firing rate to to dozens in a few seconds. Most gun enthusiasts have little need for bump stocks Only murderers then? Why compare with machines guns, when it’s totally constitutional to blame semi-automatic weapons since 1939, and reaffirmed by Scalia in Heller (The NRA was powerless against the ban for 10 long years) Not sure why Reason sucks up to the NRA so shamelessly, in clear violation of individual liberties and fundamental rights, since NO unalienable rights can be absolute, But, sadly, Reason is now a breeding ground for the alt-right, whose spiritual godfathers include faux libertarian Ron Paul Perhaps all the bellowing in the commentariat – one reason the libertarian brand is rejected by 91% of libertarians (Cato survey commissioned from a top independent pollster.) Then again,many believe that reality can be changed by forceful bellowing. And the entire universe can disappear, if we simply refuse to see it. This is not the Reason of 50 years ago, not to anyone who was there (as a reader) Wow, this post is filled with many of the same insights I used to read in Michael Hihn’s comments. Sadly, it seems Reason banned him. But I’m happy there are still plenty more anti-NRA libertarians around here. In time I’m confident the rest of the libertarian movement will embrace the Democratic Party’s position on guns. #LibertariansAgainstTheNRA #BanAssaultWeapons #GunSense OBL, you magnificent bastard! Love it! You’ll run intro all sorts of lies and bullshit on what Heller said, all out of context. The Assault Weapons Ban trumps all that, The NRA was indeed powerless against it. Hihn was banned solely because he defended libertarian values against the raging aggression here by the alt-right cyber-bullies. How many fuckoffs doers it take? How many debates on how to feed a judge into a wood chipper, head-first or feet-first? When you see “chipper” in so many usernames, THAT is what they glorify. A major cause for the libertarian brand being rejected by 91% of LIBERTARIANS. I’m one of three helping Hihn gather more evidence for a MAJOR lawsuit,. top attorney will handle it for a share of the settlement (no fees) His latest is to repeal the entire 2A as obsolete, since it’s been a few years since we used a citizens militia to defend the security of a free state!!! To be both libertarian and politically wise, repeal would be within an amendment explicitly defending the right of self-defence — technically unnecessary since 9A already does that. “Hihn was banned solely because he defended libertarian values against the raging aggression here by the alt-right cyber-bullies.” George likes his chicken spicy.

Alt-right be fascists and anti-liberty bigots .. and THIS one is PROUD to be a slug, Let’s play Hihn bingo! Pretty sure this post won the cover-all. Every single logically and factually incorrect assertion, contradiction and talking shrieking point. There’s no reason to buy a bump stock, since — if this is correct, they can’t shoot any faster. But this is misleading, since the bump stock increases the firing rate to to dozens in a few seconds. Bump stocks make it easier to fire rapidly, but do not increase the weapon’s actual rate of fire. As several other commenters have pointed out, there are many techniques for firing rapidly which require either perfectly ordinary items or no additional items at all. Bump firing, with or without a bump stock, may allow more rounds to be fired in a given amount of time, but it also makes it somewhere between difficult and impossible to fire accurately. If someone tries to murder me, I hope he uses a bump stock. Odds are excellent he’ll burn through the mag without ever hitting me. Bump stocks make it easier to fire rapidly, but do not increase the weapon’s actual rate of fire. What a PATHETIC loser. Bend over AGAIN (sneer) Fortune “A bump stock, also called a bump-fire stock, is an attachment that makes a semi-automatic weapon ? like an AR-15 rifle ? shoot nearly as fast as fully-automatic machine guns. This accessory replaces the standard stock on a rifle with a piece of plastic or metal molded to the lower end of the gun. This harnesses the gun’s natural recoil, allowing it to slide back and forth freely and rapidly and re-cock after each round fired.” Why compare with machines guns, when it’s totally constitutional to blame semi-automatic weapons since 1939, and reaffirmed by Scalia in Heller (The NRA was powerless against the ban for 10 long years) Neither Miller (I assume that’s what you’re referring to with the “1939”.) nor Heller support your persistently incorrect assertion. In Miller, the Court declared that the 2A only protected weapons “suitable for militia service”. Since the AR15 and many other semi-auto weapons are clearly suitable for militia service, a blanket semi-auto ban is clearly unconstitutional. Scalia said that weapons “in common use” were protected. Semi-auto firearms have been widely used for more than a century, so once again there’s clearly no grounds for a blanket ban. The NRA failed to challenge the AWB for political and tactical reasons, not because of its ironclad constitutionality. Not sure why Reason sucks up to the NRA so shamelessly, in clear violation of individual liberties and fundamental rights, since NO unalienable rights can be absolute, You must be very intelligent, because this is the special kind of stupidity that’s only available to the very bright. How can unalienable rights not be absolute? And while I’d agree that the NRA doesn’t do a perfect (or sometimes even very good) job of defending individual liberties and fundamental rights, I don’t think supporting them is necessarily a “clear violation” of said rights. Then again,many believe that reality can be changed by forceful bellowing. Projection, thy name is Hihn. It doesn’t matter how many times you repeat your stupidity, it doesn’t get any less stupid. Being wrong consistently and for a long time doesn’t make you any less wrong. Really, Congress just needs to declare every American’s body a “bullet free zone.” Magic force fields for everyone! The clear legislative intent is to ban automatics but not semi-automatics, not merely in that particular law, but throughout the legislative history. Bump stocks effectively create an automatic by a mechanism attached to the trigger. That they cleverly made your finger part of that mechanism does not make it any less a mechanism. That Congress didn’t anticipate this work around to the regulation doesn’t change their intent. It’s about speed of fire and human agency in the choice to fire each bullet. It’s hard to write requirements. They wrote them poorly here. “The administration probably doesn’t have the legal authority to do this.” Maybe. Maybe not. And that’s the problem. It’s unclear. This will get challenged and the Supremes will rule. If in favor, then the clear legislative intent will be given force. If against, then the Supremes will give their interpretation, likely giving direction for how the law could be written to achieve the clear legislative intent. This is not marching off people to the ovens. This is working through an imperfect process of codifying legislative intent. Laws are often unclear. They get clarified by actually challenging them. You can’t ask for an advisory opinion from the Court. Semiautos can bump fire. It’s not an “illegal technique” or anything. If Congress meant to ban bump firing, ban weapons that can do that, it would have banned semiautos. Bump firing is certainly not the functional equivalent of full auto. And I have not heard of a product being said to include parts not even present within it, let alone the user himself. In any case the dominant conservative legal philosophy does not claim to recognize legislative intent. And the newest SCOTUS justice is known, perhaps above all else, for his desire to real in administrative overreach. And the Obama ATF, and the present Democratic leadership, have all insisted that the executive does not, in fact, have the legal authority to do this. Also Congress hardly needs Court advice on how to write a law banning bump stocks. It would be an incredibly straightforward undertaking. The cases where they need the Court’s advice on how to redraft a law are those where there is a potential clash between the statute and the Constitution. This they can redraft tomorrow, quite easily. (For instance, just copypaste the new ATF regulation into your bill; whatever devices the former does indeed succeed in specifying as illegal, a statute explicity including that wording will make illegal.) “Bump firing is certainly not the functional equivalent of full auto.” Bump firing is between normal fire and full auto designed as full auto. We’ll see what the Supremes have to say. “In any case the dominant conservative legal philosophy does not claim to recognize legislative intent.” True enough. I didn’t say that it did. “Also Congress hardly needs Court advice on how to write a law banning bump stocks. It would be an incredibly straightforward undertaking.” The Supremes will rule on the specifics of bump stocks under the current law. Congress will find out if they *need* to ban bumpstocks, or if they are considered already banned under current language. A weapon is either semi-auto or full auto. Pulling the trigger really fast doesn’t change that. Bump firing, with or without a bump stock, is just a method for pulling the trigger faster. This is an idea so simple that even F Troop got it right. NOW Wizard 1469 says there were bump stocks in F TROOP!!! ,,,,, in the 1860s!!! REPEATS his ignorance of bump stocks Bump firing, with or without a bump stock, is just a method for pulling the trigger Fortune “A bump stock, also called a bump-fire stock, is an attachment that makes a semi-automatic weapon ? like an AR-15 rifle ? shoot nearly as fast as fully-automatic machine guns. This accessory replaces the standard stock on a rifle with a piece of plastic or metal molded to the lower end of the gun. This harnesses the gun’s natural recoil, allowing it to slide back and forth freely and rapidly and re-cock after each round fired.”68% of all comments here — defending bump stocks here — DO NOT KNOW how fast they fire … or lied. Correct source Fortune “A bump stock, also called a bump-fire stock, is an attachment that makes a semi-automatic weapon ? like an AR-15 rifle ? shoot nearly as fast as fully-automatic machine guns. This accessory replaces the standard stock on a rifle with a piece of plastic or metal molded to the lower end of the gun. This harnesses the gun’s natural recoil, allowing it to slide back and forth freely and rapidly and re-cock after each round fired.” 68% of all comments here — defending bump stocks — DO NOT KNOW HOW FAST THE FIRE!. Or are liars. You have absolutely no fucking idea what you’re talking about, regarding how firearms function. Well reasoned retort! Bump stocks don’t attach anything to the trigger. What part of SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED don’t folks understand? Probably the “shall.” Who the fuck talks like that? Plus back then it was all “?hall not be infringed” and shit. Damn! Probably right. All of it, clearly. What part of Scalia’s Heller ruling don’t you folks understand? Heller Ruling Page One 1(f). United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. ‘Miller’ said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those ‘in common use at the time.‘ We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of ‘dangerous and unusual weapons.'” …. as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment’s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty….. But the fact that modern developments have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right. “At the time” means at ratification. As does bans on “dangerous and unusual weapons” You people are starting to scare me. And you’re armed. PLEASE tell me you don’t vote! I’m very pro gun and I couldn’t care less. They are a means to circumvent laws against fully automatic weapons and should be illegal. Yep. The clear intention and expectation of the legislative history is to ban automatics. One bullet per willful firing. Making your finger part of an automatic fire mechanism is a clever attempt to circumvent those intentions. Maybe the Supremes agree it does. Maybe not. And why should automatics be illegal? I am of the opinion that if the police can have it, the civilian population should as well. They are a civilian police force, not an occupying army and should not be equipped any better than the people in the community where they work. The police are not and occupying army. occupying army and should not be equipped any better than the people in the community where they work. “They are a civilian police force.” Next …. I won’t miss bump stocks, BUT READ THE FINE PRINT! Not only does this effort make possession or manufacture of the stocks illegal, IT WILL REQUIRE CURRENT OWNERS EITHER TO DESTROY ANY THEY OWN OR OBLIGE THEM TO TURN THEM INTO THE GOVERNMENT. Which has to be the WORST precedent attempted in this never-ending battle to “control” guns by violating the Ninth and Second amendments. If the Government can assert power to force a turn-in of the stocks, then that will become precedent for future demands that citizens surrender the entire weapon. Which is why everyone needs to write Congress and the President today, saying you oppose such a ban. So, you oppose pro-life? And are clueless about Court rulings. On what basis do you fantasize that the government has no charge to defend LIFE,liberty and the pursuit of happiness.? Were owners of automatics grandfathered in, or did they have to turn them in? I would have expected the latter. In this case, no one has to turn in their semi autos, they just have to turn in their bump stocks for them. So it’s okay to steal some property? As for full autos (and other NFA items), it was originally possible to keep them, with restrictions only applying to transfers of new and existing machine guns. Over the years, there were several amnesties allowing for registration of existing NFA items. Then the Hughes Amendment banned the sale of any new machine guns to private citizens. Machine guns that were privately owned prior to passage may still be possessed and sold. Making this part of the “Firearms Owners Protection Act” is a bit of irony that I’d savor, if it weren’t so stupid. One more reason I don’t kneel at the altar of Saint Ronnie. As for why it’s stupid, do you know how many crimes have been committed with legally owned machine guns since passage of the NFA? I’m aware of two. Fun fact: both of those crimes were committed by cops, not private citizens. To the best of my knowledge, exactly zero private citizens have committed any crime using a legally owned machine gun. As for why it’s stupid, do you know how many crimes have been committed with legally owned machine guns since passage of the NFA? I’m aware of two But NOT aware of how fast bump stocks fire. How many legal machine guns are there? Whether or not bump stocks are the equivalent of an automatic weapon, or indeed whether automatic rifles etc should be subject to regulation and such does or does not run afoul of the 2A is not the most important part of this discussion. The MOST IMPORTANT idea here is that an administrative agency can declare you to be a felon one day for owning an otherwise benign contraption when 3 times (?) previously it determined said contraption wasn’t a fully automatic weapon and that it couldn’t classify as such under the law. Now it is. This is the RULE OF MEN, not of LAW. It is perhaps the most important idea the Founders fought a Civil War with England over. I’m so glad to see that YOU, and whole lot of other people, no longer give a sh&t about the dangers of the RULE OF MEN. I see you are rather uninformed regarding SCOTUS rulings on 2A Agree on the regulatory authority. Perhaps. The best solution, morally and politically, is a Constitutional amendment to 1) Assure the right of self-defense (already implied by 9A) 2) Repeal 2A as obsolete. You do realize, right? that we have not used a citizens militia to defend the security of a free state for quite some time now, We libertarians HATE the hypocrites who screech about “original text” and “founders intent” unless it’s in-con-veeeeeeeem-yent to their agemda, “We libertarians” who want to “Repeal 2A as obsolete”. I guess that the Royal We of socks Ellis Wyatt and David Nolan. Even pomo Reason hasn’t come out for repealing the 2A yet. EVERY can see the paatheric winger lied about my comment Because I NAILED his sorry ass You do realize, right? that we have not used a citizens militia to defend the security of a free state for quite some time now, HE SAYS WE HAVE NO PROFESSIONAL MILITARY, We libertarians HATE the hypocrites who screech about “original text” and “founders intent” unless it’s in-con-veeeeeeeem-yent to their agenda, A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed Army Navy Air Force Marines And NO militia even exists FUCK your “Living Constitution” And NO militia even exists ?????? wrong. Google “State Defense Force” and tell me there are no militias There’s no CITIZEN militia, Original intent NOT your living constitution. Which is totally irrelevant anyhow, As I stated in boldface, ” we have not used a citizens militia to defend the security of a free state for quite some time now,”. Original intent. NOT your “living constitution.” “I see you are rather uninformed regarding SCOTUS rulings on 2A” I’ve forgotten more about the 2A than you ever knew. As the SC EXPLICITY said in Cruishank (then endorsed AGAIN in Miller) the right to arms existed PRIOR to the adoption of the Constitution/2A and “doesn’t depend on that instrument for its existence”. The militia clause of the 2A is probably the only phrase in the Constitution that actually has ZERO effect. It neither adds nor subtracts from Congress’s power over the militia (ditto for the States). It was a “consolation prize” to the anti-Federalists who tried to stop the adoption of the Constitution, and tried to amend it to remove the power of the Congress to raise a standing army and return control of the militia’s back to the states. They lost at every turn in that regard. All we got from the anti-Federalist opposition to the new Constitution was the Bill of Rights. A bill protecting INDIVIDUAL rights. The militia issues you raise are irrelevant to all of this discussion. I’ve forgotten more about the 2A than you ever knew. I’ll ignore the snippiness. And stick with facts and proof. You explicitly reject the Founder’s intent for a “living constitution.” I cite original intent from SCOTUS rulings. And I’ll respect you enough to PROVE your source is ?dishonest. Or ignorant. As the SC EXPLICITY said in Cruishank (then endorsed AGAIN in Miller) the right to arms existed PRIOR to the adoption of the Constitution/2A and “doesn’t depend on that instrument for its existence”. Do I believe you or Scalia? REASD Cruikshank. That PARAGRAPH says the KKK had engaged in “conspiracy” to deprive the right from blacks, Miller’s RELEVANT part says (by Scalia, to fact-check more easily, link follows) …Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. “At the time” means at ratification. Some say that means “currently.” — which requires ignoring the paragraph! Bans on “dangerous and unusual weapons” also prove them wrong. (Miller cites many sources at ratification) cont’d Part 2/3 The militia issues you raise are irrelevant to all of this discussion. That’s a “living Consrtuition.” Do I believe you or Scalia? Heller Ruling Page One 1(f). United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes (The limitation on protected weapons does NOT infringe on the right, merely defines what the right protects. ) Your source may have ignored (or confused) that Miller has two separate sections, as does Heller, for the same reason. Miller dealt with restrictions on pistols. Then, like Scalia did, the broader right is required for context ? to define the protection is ONLY the modern equivalent of 18tth common weapons. The militia clause of the 2A is probably the only phrase in the Constitution that actually has ZERO effect. You REJECT what the founders ratified?. On what authority?. I’ll take Scalia. cont’d Part 3/3 >It neither adds nor subtracts from Congress’s power over the militia (ditto for the States). Was it ratified? When was it amended? It was a “consolation prize” to the anti-Federalists who tried to stop the adoption of the Constitution,?. So, you AGREE it was the Founders intent They lost at every turn in that regard. Then so do you. Who convinced you, that ANY words in our Constitution can be ignored. When you read the Constitution, Article 5 says how and why you need to amend ) No offense, but I suggest you replace your “living constitution”with … google “originalism.” That’s a lot easier than plowing through Scalia and Miller! Anything else? An actual cogent argument would be nice. But we won’t get that from you so what is the point. He TOTALLY humiliated you! And your severe denial can be a serious mental affliction. Different interpretations of statutory law by different administrations. An inevitable part of the Rule of Law. That’s what SCOTUS does. As a CHECK on the power of the Executive! (And Legislative) Check and Balances. THREE co-equal branches. It needs to get struck down, on separation of powers grounds if nothing else – although it should get whacked on takings clause grounds and second amendment grounds too (I’m not terribly hopeful there). POTUS and his minions – whatever the agency, but in this case the ATF – should NOT be able to unilaterally redefine things to ban them. Allowing POTUS to do that is a horrible, horrible precedent. Except that they won’t stop screaming because we “did something.” The only way to guarantee no mass shootings is to ban an confiscate all guns and institute a police state. Until we do that, they’ll still keep screaming. Oh, they’ll keep screaming even then. Even if it were seriously attempted, universal confiscation is doomed to failure. Even if someone could wave a magic wand and make every firearm on earth disappear, along with the knowledge of how to make new ones, that would hardly put an end to violence. After all, people managed to kill and injure each other for thousands of years before guns were invented. I totally agree that it’s a bad idea to even toss the grabbers a bone with a bump stock ban. When they’re being honest, they freely admit that their proposals are merely first steps. And when those first steps don’t have the desired effect, they’ll just call for more. I find it hard to believe that they will ever step back and admit it’s not working. Failure can only mean we haven’t gone far enough! The only time they’re willing to admit they were wrong and repeal something is if it costs the government money (like the Maryland stamping rule that didn’t solve a single crime). As long as the burden is borne by someone else, they don’t care. That’s why the idiotic interstate handgun ban is still on the books. It’s absurd that if you have a Texas carry license that is honored by Louisiana that you can’t just buy a pistol in Louisiana to begin with. The only way to guarantee no mass shootings is to ban an confiscate all guns and institute a police state. Until we do that, they’ll still keep screaming. That’s all you’ve got? Inconvenient facts (fully documented) FACT: England’s 2nd gun control (1996) saw ONE mass shooting in 22 years FACT: United States had 317 mass shootings from 1999-2013. Adjust for population (5:1) and they had 5 shootings in 22 years … We had 317 in 14 years. Do the math. Mass Shootings Per year UK = 0.2 per year US = 22.6 per year = 11,300% higher (adjusted for population) Are those YOUR values on “sanctity of human life?” Inconvenient questions: 1) If teachers are armed … who will be killed first? 2) MIGHT it be possible that we have so many ARMED bad guys … BECAUSE our citizenry is so highly armed? Might it work in both directions, like the nuclear arms race did? 3) In Britain, Ireland, Norway, Iceland and New Zealand, officers are unarmed when they are on patrol. WHY? And HOW 4) What happens when two absolute rights are in conflict? Which prevails? Who decides? And why? NOT advocating gun grabs, just providing the truth. If your examples covered more than just the US and Britain, you’d have drawn a pretty different conclusion. On a per capita basis, for both death rate and rate of occurrence, we rank below #50 – with “first world” and “developing” countries both above and below us in rates. In 1910, England and Wales had a murder rate of .81. In 2010, it was 1.14. In that timeframe, they went from effectively no gun control, to incredibly strict gun control, and their homicide rate changed very little – in fact, a decade by decade look shows that (at least when data is available) their homicide rate can’t really be attributed to any major policy, because it was incredibly stable for all years that we have data (the record high and low have less than a 1 per 100,000 difference). Over that same timeframe, the US murder rate started at 4.6, ended at 4.8, and had a high of just over 10 per 100,000, and the fluctuations don’t really correlate to the timeline of landmark gun control legislation in the US. Your inconvenient facts aren’t really inconvenient… All they demonstrate is that Brits, for some reason, are unlikely to murder each other, be it individually, or in job lots. Intentional Homicide Rates (Latest available, UN) Per 100,000 population 5.3 United States 3.0 Europe and Asia (each) 1.7 Canada 0.9 UK Thank you for playing, No, thank you for playing. Using UNODC 2016 numbers: The world as a whole is 6.2. The Americas as a whole is 16.3 Africa’s is 12.5. Russia is 10.82 The Czech Republic (with the loosest firearm laws in the world after us) is .61 Switzerland (depending on who’s stats you use, the #2 or #3 country for firearms ownership) is .54 Yemen (the other competitor for #2) is 6.66 About the only thing you can draw from current UNODC statistics is “No Correlation”. The US has twice (or more – estimates for number of guns have been fairly stable at “about 300,000,000” for over a decade) as many guns per capita as the next country on the list. Our high Two of the top three countries by gun ownership are below the average – in Switzerland’s case WELL below the average – and the third is only slightly above it. My link proves you wrong. You link nothing. I’ll add though, that given the EXTREME variance from one estimate to the next, about the only thing that can be said as far as how many guns are out there is that the US has a metric butt ton, probably between 1 and 2 per person. So you can’t get any closer than a 50% margin of error. As for your questions 1. Assuming that voluntarily armed teachers are equivalent to any other voluntarily armed citizen, and assuming that they choose to engage, you’ve got roughly a 75% chance that it’ll be the next asshole who tries to commit a mass shooting, and a roughly 18% chance that they won’t stop the asshole outright, but will reduce the number of innocent lives lost. 2. Australia, the Philippines, and Brazil, with their high numbers of homemade SMGs (some of which are just as good professionally made SMGs) would suggest otherwise. As would the fact that murder and crime rates (both worldwide and internal to the US) don’t correlate to gun ownership. 3. Britain has had a low homicide rate since we’ve been keeping track. The others are all similar, plus their total combined population is less than that of the New York Metrolitan statistical area, spread out over a much larger land area. 4. There are no absolute rights in conflict here. Gun ownership doesn’t have any statistically noticeable effect on murder, mass murder, or crime in general, and there’s no such thing as a right to feel safe. You certainly seem to be advocating a gun grab. Either that, or your Google-fu sucks in just the right way to make it seem like you’re cherry picking statistics. PS: “ActualRightWingPatriot” said “guarantee”, not reduce, so you didn’t actually do anything to disprove his point. 1) Shooter enters … Number of armed teachers irrelevant … If he thinks teachers are armed ? and doesn’t know which ones, he will kill EVERY in his path. Even if none are armed. Right? 2) You show no causation. And that’s not what he asked. 3.) You assume causation in #2. And refuse to accept it here. 4. There are no absolute rights in conflict here. You CANNOT know that. Life is the most obvious. All inalienable rights are absolute. Life, 2 packages you cannot name, Liberty and Pursuit of Happjness. Plus a yet-unknown number of unenumerated rights in 9A. Judges do not “invent” rights. They recognize them, for over 500 years. NO right has existed (in law or natural) until declared by a judge or tribunal. ONLY they may do so, as a check against the other two balances. A right can’t be recognized until there is a judicial proceeding., per founders intent. 9A says ALL unnamed rights may not be abridged or denied by ANY level of government, did not name a singje one.. You certainly seem to be advocating a gun grab. How can you conclude that when you don’t understand a single question, OR what was responde Google-fu sucks in just the right way to make it seem like you’re cherry picking statistics. Follow the link before slandering me. UN statistics for every country on earth. Now another blunder ?. Cont’d Page 2/2 “ActualRightWingPatriot” said “guarantee”, not reduce, so you didn’t actually do anything to disprove his point. WRONG AGAIN!!! Here’s what Nolan quoted, and replied to! The only way to guarantee no mass shootings is to ban an confiscate all guns and institute a police state. Until we do that, they’ll still keep screaming. Plus, it’s stupid, since NOBODY has even mentioned GUARANTEEING non mass shootings. I’m not Nolan, but these have libertarian concepts for 50 years., and constitutional for over 200, I cannot resist. What point have YOU made, by not understanding any of the question, and not knowing what he responded to? (Others may respond to this or further questions. I shall not. I do suggest that ant further comments be both adult and civil) Have a great day and and enjoy the holidays. Aaand… It looks like the GOA may very well have the balls to challenge this. Or at least they’re talking big about it on their Facebook. “Bump stocks are modifications that can be attached to a rifle to increase the rate of fire,” Bump stocks DO NOT increase the rate of fire. A semi-auto rifle can only fire so many rounds per minute regardless of whether the trigger mechanism is being actuated with a finger or bump stock. The ATF evaluated bump stocks and determined they were “accessories.” If the increased the rate of fire the ATF would have banned them for converting a semi-auto rifle to full auto which must be licensed and taxed. Yes, it’s legal to own fully auto firearms provided one pays the licensing fees and taxes.

November 29, 2018 House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has been widely criticized for clogging the leadership pipeline. But she has also worked to create more positions and widen the decisionmaking circle to include newer members. And while the top three leaders chosen by Democrats this week will be the same folks who have been running things for more than a decade – Ms. Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and James Clyburn – at some point this troika will step aside and the next generation will step up. That’s why it’s worth focusing on the winners of the lower-rung positions on the leadership ladder. Among the rising stars is Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a 48-year-old African-American from New York who used a previous Pelosi-created position as a springboard to his new role as chair of the caucus, the No. 5 job for Democrats. He is often talked about as a potential future speaker. Indeed, the group of leaders elected this week is, as Pelosi sometimes calls her colleagues, a “kaleidoscope” – not unlike the diverse Americans who handed Democrats the steering wheel in the House this fall. Here’s a look at some of the newest members of the Democratic leadership team. Leadership is often steeped in lengthy experience. That is certainly the case for the three lawmakers selected to lead House Democrats. But amid growing demand for generational change, they also elevated some new faces. Leadership is often steeped in lengthy experience. That is certainly the case for the three lawmakers selected to lead House Democrats. But amid growing demand for generational change, they also elevated some new faces. Even before Wednesday’s election results were announced, House Democrats knew who their top three leaders would be. It’s the same folks who have been running things for more than a decade – Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and James Clyburn. All pushing 80 years old, they all ran unopposed, with more than three-quarters of the Democratic caucus nominating leader Pelosi to be the next speaker of the House. Ms. Pelosi still has to win over more supporters when the whole House votes for speaker on Jan. 3. But at some point – and critics hope it’s sooner rather than later – this troika will step aside and the next generation will step up. That’s why it’s worth focusing on the winners of the lower-rung positions on the leadership ladder. Usually, only political junkies are curious about these folks, and that’s been especially true for the past eight years that House Democrats have wandered in a political wilderness as the minority power. Not anymore. While Pelosi has been criticized for clogging the pipeline, she has also worked to create more leadership positions and widen the decision-making circle to include newer members. Among the rising stars is Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, an African-American from New York, who used one of those previous Pelosi-created positions as a springboard to his new role as chair of the caucus – the No. 5 job. He’s often talked about as a potential future speaker. Leadership is often steeped in lengthy experience. That is certainly the case for the three lawmakers selected to lead House Democrats. But amid growing demand for generational change, they also elevated some new faces. Leadership is often steeped in lengthy experience. That is certainly the case for the three lawmakers selected to lead House Democrats. But amid growing demand for generational change, they also elevated some new faces. “I think the brilliance of Leader Pelosi was always the ability to create more seats at the leadership table,” says former Democratic Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who once occupied one of those seats. “Rather than being exclusive, she was inclusive. Even in the minority, she found a way to bring people into the conference room for leadership settings and ensure they made valuable contributions.” Of course, standard bearers can emerge from places other than these slots – chairmanships or caucus leaders. For instance, South Carolina’s Congressman Clyburn, now the chief vote counter, or “whip” (the No. 3 slot), began his ascent as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. But the Democratic lawmakers who were elected this week had to make their case before all of their political peers, and those peers took a definite generational turn, electing people in their 50s and 40s, progressive and moderate, minorities and women. The group is, as Pelosi calls sometimes calls her legislative colleagues, a “kaleidoscope” – not unlike the diverse Americans who handed Democrats the steering wheel in the House this fall. Here is a look at some of the newest members of the Democratic leadership team. These days, it’s not unusual for Rep. Ben Ray Luján’s name to come up in talk about the 2018 elections. As the first Latino to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the New Mexico congressman helped raise and direct the funds that ultimately led to the party’s House takeover. He cemented his place in the national spotlight on Election Night when he stood with Pelosi to celebrate the victory. The next day, he launched his bid for assistant Democratic leader, the No. 4 spot in the caucus (he ran uncontested). Congressman Luján also plays up his humbler roots: How his grandfather was a sheep herder and his father an ironworker before becoming speaker of the New Mexico House. The 46-year-old Luján himself worked nights as a blackjack dealer at a tribal casino until he got his college degree in 2007. Luján got his start in politics in 2002 as New Mexico’s deputy treasurer. In 2008, he ran for the Third District, which then-Rep. Tom Udall vacated to run for the US Senate. This will be his sixth term. Democrats opted for generational change when they elected Rep. Hakeem Jeffries to be their caucus chair – the fifth-highest position in leadership, and one that will put the ambitious congressman in the room where the important decisions are made. Some in the caucus speculate that this rising star could eventually become the first African-American speaker of the House. Congressman Jeffries, who hails from Brooklyn, in New York, and is just finishing up his third term, has been a fierce critic of President Trump. But he emphasizes consensus-building among the most diverse caucus in history (a “gorgeous mosaic” he calls it), and the need to work with the president where possible. In college, his fraternity brothers nicknamed him “Kool Ha” for his measured speaking. He narrowly beat the far more experienced and left-leaning Rep. Barbara Lee of California, who is the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus (Jeffries is a member of the caucus). Congresswoman Lee told reporters after the vote that she felt ageism and sexism had played a role. Still, Lee supporters like African-American Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida said they were pleased that a black member who is “young enough, smart enough, and has the respect of the caucus” is in a top slot that could some day lead to the speakership. “This is almost like President Obama’s inauguration!” said Congresswoman Wilson from underneath her trademark star-spangled cowboy hat. With support from Pelosi, Jeffries was elected in 2016 to one of three new co-chairmanships that she created to hone the Democrats’ election messaging. He calls himself a “pragmatic progressive” – a pro-union Democrat with experience as a corporate attorney. The congressman’s passion is criminal justice reform and economic inequality, and he is a top cosponsor of the bipartisan prison reform bill that lawmakers on both sides are trying to push through this lame-duck session. He served in the New York State Assembly for six years before being elected to Congress in 2012. Sen. Elizabeth Warren may be Massachusetts’ liberal star, but Rep. Katherine Clark, who represents the state’s Fifth District, has made her own waves. In 2015, she launched a campaign against online harassment that inspired an anonymous caller to falsely report an active shooter at the congresswoman’s home in Melrose, Mass., bringing armed police officers to her lawn. In 2016, after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Florida, she joined civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia in leading a sit-in on the House floor, demanding that Republican leaders allow a vote on gun control legislation. A year later, a C-SPAN video of Congresswoman Clark grilling Education Secretary Betsy DeVos about discrimination against LGBTQ students in private schools went viral. Now, after besting California Rep. Pete Aguilar for caucus vice chair, Clark is poised to help shape party policy. She’s said her goal is to incorporate the historic diversity of the 116th Congress into the party’s policymaking process. Clark was first elected to Congress in 2013 to fill the seat then-Rep. Ed Markey vacated when he ran for Senate. Prior to the House, Clark served on her local school board and then in the state senate. Last week, Pelosi announced another new position in party leadership: chair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee (DPCC), the caucus’s messaging arm. The next day, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline sent a letter saying he would drop his bid against Luján for assistant Democratic leader and run – unopposed – for the new post instead. Congressman Cicilline had previously served as one of three DPCC co-chairs (which the new position will be above) alongside Jeffries and Rep. Cheri Bustos (D) of Illinois, helping craft the new party slogan, “For the people.” Though not among Pelosi’s favorites for that role – she’d reportedly wanted someone who could appeal to a working-class constituency – Cicilline ran, won, and has since made a case for working families that Pelosi has praised. But Cicilline’s big passion is gun control. As mayor of Providence, he was a founding member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which later helped form the nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety. In 2015, he authored a bill to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons. Cicilline became the fourth openly gay member of Congress when he won the First District seat in 2010. He currently serves as co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus and, following the legalization of gay marriage in 2014, introduced legislation to broaden anti-discrimination protections for the LGBT community. This former reporter from Illinois has been all about one thing: making sure Democrats don’t overlook the Heartland, like they did in 2016. In a leadership team almost exclusively made up of lawmakers from the coasts, she’s the only one from the Midwest. Her district in the northwest corner of Illinois covers a lot of rural territory, and Trump won it (barely) two years ago. Her grandfather was a hog farmer – and also a state lawmaker. Like Jeffries, Luján, and Cicilline, she is sometimes mentioned as a possible speaker down the road, but in an interview earlier this year, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D) of Virginia batted down that idea. As a speaker, he explained, she would regularly have to defend left-of-center positions, and “that would be a kiss of death in a Trump district.” Still, Representative Bustos’s mantra that the party should field candidates that fit the district – including more conservative ones – was shared by Luján, who led Democrats to victory this year as chair of the DCCC. Now she’s got his job after a three-way race that she handily won. In 2020, “every single district will be contested and protected,” she said Thursday. She pointed out that Democrats picked up 16 districts in the heartland this time – about the size of the margin they will have to defend in two years. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Bustos is just finishing up her third term, after working in communications in the health-care industry. She is known as a workhorse – recruiting, fundraising, and mentoring new politicians in her “boot camps.” Back home in Illinois, she likes to try out people’s jobs and talk to folks in supermarkets to stay close to her constituents. Like Jeffries and Cicilline, she used her position as one of the three Pelosi-created co-chairs of the Democrats’ messaging arm as a springboard up the ladder. Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

The biggest increase was in crimes targeting Muslims, Statistics Canada reported, in a year that saw a deadly mass shooting in a Quebec mosque, followed by a government motion to study Islamophobia that itself sparked anti-Muslim sentiment.  The spike mirrors an increase in hate crimes south of the border in the United States, where they rose in 2017 for the third consecutive year, according to the FBI. “We were shocked by the numbers – and, at the same time, we weren’t,” said Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. “This increase didn’t occur in a vacuum.” Canada is not immune to rhetoric coming from the United States, said Amira Elghawaby, a board member of the Anti-Hate Network advocacy group. “It’s a porous border – not just for people and goods but for ideas.” The statistics published on Thursday include crimes reported to police that were determined to be motivated by hatred toward an identifiable group. According to victimization surveys, two-thirds of these crimes go unreported, Statistics Canada said. The number of hate crimes targeting Muslims more than doubled, rising to 349 from 139. The number of hate crimes targeting black people increased by 50%, to 321 from 214. And the number of hate crimes targeting Jewish people increased to 360 from 221. It is not yet known whether the upward trend in hate crimes continued through 2018, which saw such high-profile incidents as a Muslim man beaten in front of his family in a parking lot and Jewish teenagers attacked walking down the street. “We’re following this closely,” Gardee said. “And we’ll continue to raise our voice for more coordinated action across the board.”",2018-11-29 16:41:30,"Canada hate crimes up 47% as Muslims, Jews and black people targeted",,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
41,https://www.denverpost.com/2018/11/29/broncos-bengals-jeff-driskel-von-miller-donates-to-law-enforcement/,"Trending: The Broncos knew what they were encountering with when facing the Los Angeles Chargers’ Philip Rivers and Pittsburgh Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger the last two weeks. Rivers and Roethlisberger have a combined 435 starts and 762 touchdown passes in the regular season and playoffs combined. Sunday at Cincinnati will be the near-literal opposite situation.  The Bengals lost Andy Dalton to a thumb injury in last week’s loss to Cleveland. Jeff Driskel will make his first NFL start. He has 36 career passing attempts (all this year) and was 17 of 29 for 155 yards and one touchdown against the Browns. “You watch him throw the football and he’s pretty accurate,” Broncos coach Vance Joseph said. “He’s an NFL quarterback and we can’t sleep on him. We’re not going to discount the guy’s ability.” The Broncos should expect the Bengals to use Driskel’s athleticism to call run-pass options and to prioritize receiver A.J. Green, back after a three-game absence (toe injury). “I’m not back there looking to run first, but it’s definitely a tool I have and something that generates big plays,” Driskel told Cincinnati reporters. Driskel was a highly recruited high school player in the Orlando, Fla., area and played at Florida and Louisiana Tech. He has a five-game showcase with the Bengals. “It’s just a great opportunity to go out and get a start and not think about anything besides this week,” Driskel said. “If you start to let your mind wander into the distance, you can’t narrow your focus.” Miller leads donation. Led by linebacker Von Miller, the Broncos organization has committed more than $200,000 to SHIELD616, an organization that will help provide law enforcement with 125-plus protective kits designed for police and firefighters responding to active shooter/mass shooting situations. Players will present officers and firefighters with their kits after practice Dec. 20. Each kit will include a ballistic vest and helmet and a wound trauma kit. Also making personal donations were several players and Joseph, general manager John Elway and president/CEO Joe Ellis. Yiadom up next. If third cornerback Tramaine Brock (rib) can’t play, rookie Isaac Yiadom will take his spot like he did against Pittsburgh. The Steelers went after Yiadom, but Roethlisberger was only 1 of 4 for 13 yards against him. “That’s a tough game to come into, going against a Hall of Fame quarterback in the fourth quarter,” Broncos cornerback Chris Harris said. “I think he’ll be ready this week having a whole week to prepare for the Bengals. I expect him to play well for us.” Bierria getting chance. Rookie sixth-round linebacker Kieshawn Bierria has played 10 defensive snaps in the last four games as a way of giving Todd Davis a quick break. “Anytime I can get out there and help the defense, it’s a good thing,” Bierria said. “When I’m out there, it’s not really noticed by a lot of people and that’s a big thing because I’m making sure there isn’t a drop-off. It’s definitely helped my confidence to get some real defensive snaps.” Brandon Marshall (knee) has missed three consecutive games, making Josey Jewell a base-down starter alongside Davis. Bierria has one tackle. Footnotes. Per the NFL’s transaction wire, the Broncos waived first-year linebacker Alexander Johnson after practice on Thursday. … Brock and linebacker Shaq Barrett (hip) did not practice Thursday. Marshall and receiver Emmanuel Sanders (heel) were limited. … Defensive end Derek Wolfe has seven quarterback pressures, three knockdowns and 1 1/2 sacks this year, but is itching for more. He has one sack in the last six games. “I’m definitely getting some extra (blocking) attention out there, but that means somebody else is there to make plays,” he said. … Since firing defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Nov. 12, Bengals coach Marvin Lewis has called the defensive plays in losses to Baltimore and Cleveland. “Their awareness of the opponent needs to continue to grow,” Lewis said. “We lost a little bit of that somehow, but we’re gaining it back day by day. They wanted answers and I’ve given them answers.” … Per the NFL, television ratings for games this year are up five percent compared to 2017. Forty-six of the top 50 most-watched shows (and 19 of the top 20) this year are NFL games.

The weak numbers come in the wake of the Dick's decision in February to not only halt assault weapon sales, but to no longer sell guns to people under the age of 21 in response to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 dead. But broader trends also appear to have had an impact. After breaking records each of the last three years, the number of background checks conducted by the FBI for gun purchases this Black Friday was down 10 percent from that day last year. “In addition to the strategic decisions we made regarding firearms earlier this year, the broader industry has decelerated and remains weak as evidenced by most recent national background check data,'' Lee Bolitsky, Dick's chief financial officer said in an earnings call with investors Wednesday. ""We believe this also contributed to the decline.'' Rather than reconsidering its stance, the retailer is focusing on its private brands, its e-commerce business and its more successful sporting categories. During the third quarter, the retailer removed nearly all of its hunting products at 10 locations, replacing them with baseball-oriented items and licensed merchandise. And it may eventually make a similar move at other stores. More: Gun sales: Will Dick's Sporting Goods be hurt by a gun owners' boycott? More: Black Friday gun checks down 10 percent after 2017 broke records More: Dick's Sporting Goods successfully defies NRA as sales rise despite gun policy ""We are looking at a number of stores where the hunt business significantly under performs, and we will assess whether we want to take it out and replace it with these other categories if that ends up  to be a smart thing to do from a business standpoint,’’ CEO Ed Stack said during the call. There were 182,093 background queries through the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System last Friday. That was a significant drop from the 203,086 checks on Black Friday in 2017, which set a single-day record. The previous one-day highs also occurred on Black Friday, with 185,713 queries in 2016, and 185,345 in 2015. Background checks are required at all federally licensed firearm stores, but the number of such requests isn't an exact snapshot of the number of guns that are sold. Since multiple firearms may be part of a single transaction by one buyer, actual sales are probably higher. Gun sales often spike in the wake of mass shootings, and the record-breaking number of background checks last year followed several such attacks. There have been several mass shootings this year as well, including most recently killings at a Pittsburgh synagogue and at a California bar frequented by college students. But the Parkland shooting launched a national movement that has led to changes in some state laws and corporate policies, like Dick's, to address and stem the violence. Dick's had stopped selling assault-style weapons at its branded stores after the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting in December, 2012. But prior to its policy change in February, the retailer was still selling those guns at its 35 Field & Stream locations, which specialize in hunting and outdoor items.

43,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/11/29/civil-rights-activist-james-carrington-founder-of-orange-countys-first-african-american-church-dies-at-85/,"Trending: In a county with a small African American population, Pastor James Carrington made a huge mark. Carrington founded one of the first predominately black churches in Orange County, opening Friendship Baptist Church in Fullerton in 1964 – the middle of the civil rights movement. Four years later, he and his wife Doris launched their ongoing fight for housing integration. The charismatic preacher died of heart failure Nov. 15 at age 85. Services will be held Saturday, Dec. 1. Born in Pittsburgh, Pa., Carrington moved to Los Angeles after serving in the U.S. Navy. Carrington commuted to his church in Fullerton for several years before looking to move his young family across the county line. Despite the Supreme Court’s 1967 ruling to stop housing discrimination, landlords found excuses not to rent to his family, Carrington told the Orange County Register in 2010. “We took it on ourselves,” he said, “to find out what was going on and how people were being treated.” He and his wife partnered with a white couple to investigate. Responding to ads listing apartments for rent, the Carringtons were routinely turned down while their counterparts swiftly fielded offers. “We went to the city of Fullerton and told them, ‘This is what’s happening to our people. This is real,’” Carrington said. He kept up his activism by helping African American college students secure housing near Cal State Fullerton. In its humble beginnings, the 22-member Friendship Baptist Church held services in a congregant’s house. It soon would grow to attract hundreds and then thousands of visitors from throughout Southern California. After bouncing among seven Fullerton locations, the church finally built a permanent home in Yorba Linda in 1987. Today, Friendship Baptist has about 2,400 members, said Kenneth Curry, who was named pastor after Carrington’s retirement in 2012. As a child, Curry attended Friendship Baptist’s sister church, True Vine Missionary Baptist in Lynwood. “We sometimes would hold services together, so I have looked up to Pastor Carrington as an example of ministry for most of my life,” Curry said. “He was a stirring preacher who loved God’s people. He connected to people young and old.” Carrington counted among his friends Rosa Parks – who in 1955 sparked a major civil rights battle when she refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in Alabama. Although she was Methodist, Parks attended Friendship’s services in the 1990s when she spent winters with her godson in Orange County. Carrington is survived by his wife of 58 years, two children, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. A public viewing will be held Friday, Nov. 30 from 3 to 7 p.m. followed by a Celebration Service from 7 to 8 p.m. at Friendship Baptist Church, 17145 Bastanchury Road, Yorba Linda; a second public viewing will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 1, with a service at 11 a.m., also at the church. Interment will take place at 11 a.m. Monday, Dec. 3, at Inglewood Park Cemetery, 3801 Manchester Blvd., Inglewood. For more information, go to wearefriendship.church.

As The Hill reported, the media wing of the National Rifle Association has laid off several employees after the gun rights lobbying group saw a $55 million drop in revenue from last year. The television network had been the cornerstone of the organization's push into the media realm, led by NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch in a widely marketed talk show. The NRATV network also showed the gun rights group's expansion further into right-wing topics and saw it aim to become a competitor to right-leaning outlets Breitbart News and Fox News. It was not clear exactly how many employees NRATV had to lay off, but network correspondent Cameron Gray took to Twitter to confirm the layoffs and announce that he was among those fired. ""Some personal news: Just shy of my 10-year anniversary, me and several colleagues had their positions terminated this morning,"" Gray wrote in a tweet that was later deleted. ""So, if you have or know of any jobs available in the DC-area, or any that can be done remotely, please let me know."" NRATV has been at the center of a number of controversies since its launch in 2016. In September, Loesch was criticized for using an edited image of the Thomas & Friends cartoon to show the cartoon characters wearing KKK hoods. ""The special focus of her ire? A tank character named Nia from Kenya who was introduced as part of the program's effort to internationalize and diversify its characters,"" noted CNN Wire. ""Horrible as that may seem to Loesch, she capped her critique by displaying a doctored picture of Thomas and two of his friends in KKK hoods riding on track seen to be burning in the background.""NRATV has taken a hit amid the gun group's cash crunch, laying off several employees yesterday, @AlexYablon reports. https://t.co/MimF8aFpmW pic.twitter.com/6p1GDC8BF0— The Trace (@teamtrace) November 29, 2018Just this week, NRATV host Chuck Holton joked about how ""the clowns from Media Matters"" would react to a mass shooting in their building.

45,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/t-magazine/editor-letter.html,"Advertisement Supported by Letter From the Editor By Hanya Yanagihara It is an irresistible reduction to contrast the eras of our former and current president as absolute opposites: one, an age of progress for all of us who’ve felt or feel shut out from the vast tent that is our country; the other, an age of regress. Yet to think this way ignores evidence to the contrary — evidence in the form of human lives. One of the great paradoxes of America is that we could be a country that elected its first black president, one whose term saw, yes, a radically more expansive understanding of what it means to be human, but also one of the worst school shootings in our history, a mass shooting at a gay nightclub and multiple murders of unarmed black boys and men, shot because of who they were, not what they did. Crucially, that president’s reactions to these horrors were markedly different than those of our current president to similar incidents, but the fact remains that no era since our founding has been free of these contradictions (indeed, these murders that occurred during the previous administration were not new developments — it was technology that enabled their immediate and widespread dissemination). The thrill and sorrow of America is that our brief history is one of steps forward and backward, that ours is a nation in a constant state of revision, that we are each of us choreographers of its halting, tripping, sometimes ugly, sometimes transcendent dance. It was late in the second year of what is, for many of us, the most challenging and confounding and frightening government of modern history that we gathered the 32 men you’ll find here: African-American writers of literature, be it poetry, plays or fiction. We assembled them not because there are more of them than ever before, or that they’re collectively more meaningful than they were — as the playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins tells the novelist Ayana Mathis, the author of our story about these artists, “It feels like people are just suddenly noticing that there are black people in the room” — or, importantly, that their voices are somehow more essential than those of black female writers (also numerous and diverse and excellent, beginning with Mathis). We did so because the black male body itself is so particularly freighted in our culture, because it has been used to monger fear, because it has been appropriated as symbol and shorthand. These writers’ works remind us that the black male is not something apart from America: Rather, he is America itself, and that to read literary works by black men is to read America, too. Nearly two years ago, when I was interviewing for my job as editor of T, I told Dean Baquet, The Times’s executive editor, that I wanted the magazine to feel urgent: In extreme political climates, art of all kinds responds to the government under which it’s created, and I wanted this publication to document and comment on the artists whose work engaged in some way with the culture around them. The idea of the artist (or designer or director or author) creating in a vacuum has always been a romance and has never seemed more mythical than it does today. Even the artist who produces work with no discernible traces of the outside world is choosing to make a statement by ignoring it. As Nancy Hass writes about the artist Kiki Smith, “It is [her] very act of working incessantly, of pushing forward to construct a macrocosm evermore expansive and enveloping while everything around her seems to rub and scrape and fall apart, that is itself Smith’s ultimate political act.” For those of us who are not artists, our job is as important: to look and hear and listen with our whole hearts, to be vulnerable in the face of another’s work, to be open to discomfort, to see ourselves in the lives of another. Art cannot save the world, but it isn’t meant to — it is meant to ask what it means to be human, again and again, no matter the state of the world, no matter the cost.

47,https://www.foxsports.com/san-diego/story/mahomes-surprises-youth-football-players-for-sports-matter-113018,"The kids from Kansas City’s inner-city football program were already in the kind of happy-go-lucky mood that comes with a modest holiday shopping spree when they lined up to take a picture.
Some were laughing. All of them were smiling.
Then their idol stepped out from his hiding place and the screaming started.
Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had taken time out of his day off Tuesday to show up at Dick’s Sporting Goods and surprise the kids from KC United. He took photographs, signed autographs and presented the team’s founder, local pastor Adrian Roberson, with $5,000 to fund next season.
“I have no words for it,” said Roberson, who broke into tears.
Mahomes is arguably the hottest player in the NFL this season, his record-setting performance as a first-year starter helping the Chiefs to a 9-2 record. And not surprisingly, that has caused the demands on his time to skyrocket, from the unending interview requests to meet-and-greets and other events.
Somehow, the 23-year-old quarterback has managed to take everything in stride.
“I don’t know if it does something for me. It’s just part of being in this community,” Mahomes said the following day, before stepping onto the practice field to prepare for Sunday’s trip to Oakland.

“This community loves football and they love each other,” Mahomes continued. “It’s more than just football. It’s being a good person and giving back to the community.”
Mahomes has certainly ingrained himself in the community.
He threw out a first pitch at a Royals game over the summer. He was the grand marshal for the NASCAR race, wearing a cutoff jersey from the T-Bones, the local minor league baseball team. He pops up at stores, concerts and restaurants as if he was anybody else, even sitting front row at Sprint Center last week to watch his college, Texas Tech, play in the Hall of Fame Classic basketball tournament.
When he showed up at a Verizon store on Monday for a meet-and-greet, store officials were worried the crowd would be too large and asked that his appearance not be publicized. Several hundred people still found out, forming a line that snaked around the building as they awaited his arrival.
“I feel the excitement and I feel the love not only for me but for the Kansas City Chiefs,” Mahomes said. “It’s special. This is a special place. There’s great people here. That’s one of the main reasons I love playing for this team.”

Von Miller is leading a $200,000 initiative to provide protective kits to first responders in mass shootings and improve local law enforcement relations.
The donation from Miller, his teammates and the organization to SHIELD616, a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit organization, will provide more than 125 advanced protective kits for police and firefighters responding to active shooter or mass shooting situations.
“It’s been 300 mass shootings this year, and I’ve only heard about four. When I was hit with that information, it really hit home for me,” Miller said. “I’ve got personal ties with Colorado — of course, we had the shooting here at the theater my second year in the league — and really heavy ties in Dallas. It was what, two years ago that we had the shooting there.”
Miller said his best friend is a police officer in Arlington, Texas, “so I can help him and some of his colleagues with some of these vests. It’s a real cool deal, the 616 initiative.”
Miller spoke up at a team meeting last week to get his teammates on board with the initiative, and nearly 20 players pitched in, as did team president Joe Ellis, general manager John Elway, and coach Vance Joseph.

		











SHIELD616 kits include a ballistic vest and helmet, along with a wound trauma kit, that upgrade standard equipment to protect against automatic weapons and assault rifles.
The initiative also allows for donors to contact the first responders they are helping protect to foster ongoing relationships, the Broncos said.
“It takes the unification of an entire community to not only better protect our first responders with physical armor, but to break down barriers between first responders and the citizens they serve,” said SHIELD616 President Jake Skifstad, a former police officer who founded the organization in 2015.
“It’s priceless to see complete strangers invest in the safety of first responders, changing their lives and the lives of their families,” Skifstad said. “We are humbled and proud to see that Von Miller, his teammates and the Broncos are utilizing their God-given leadership gifts and influence to not only better protect our protectors, but to also help build positive community relations.”
Joseph said he was proud of Miller for leading the initiative.
“Von is a special person. He wants to help people,” Joseph said. “He’s a great teammate and he’s great in the community. This is huge for Von to provide resources for our first responders. Obviously there have been a number of shootings in our country. It’s a huge issue.”
DAK THE DUCKLING
Dak Prescott’s first game with Drew Brees on the other sideline was a chance for the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year to reflect on the Pro Bowl trip they shared during that magical year for the Dallas quarterback.
Prescott had just led the Cowboys to an NFC-best 13 wins, while Brees got his 10th Pro Bowl nod following his record fifth 5,000-yard season. New Orleans had missed the playoffs for the third straight year, all 7-9 finishes. Prescott, who grew up in Louisiana, wasn’t thinking about those Saints records. He was thinking about Brees’ records.
“You do everything you can,” Prescott said when asked if he picked Brees’ brain during those few days together. “Like a little duckling. You just follow Drew Brees and just figure out what he does, how he does stuff. I was thankful to have him. Drew opened up and he shared some things.”
Prescott also noticed how Brees responded to those three straight losing seasons. With the 39-year-old having one of his best seasons in 2018, the Saints are on the verge of their second straight trip to the playoffs after winning 11 games last season.
“He’s taking care of his body, has done all the right things,” Prescott said. “Especially facing adversity, facing the middle of his career and some people were saying he wouldn’t do what he has done now. It just speaks to the character of that guy.”

		











HOW LOW CAN YOU GO?
The Minnesota Vikings have been at the forefront of the creativity around the league since the celebration rules were relaxed last season to allow for more group play in the end zone.
In a game at Chicago last year, the Vikings initiated a game of “Duck, Duck, Goose” (or “Duck, Duck, Gray Duck,” as it’s called in Minnesota) after a touchdown reception by Kyle Rudolph. In their game against Green Bay last weekend, Dalvin Cook‘s catch, run and score prompted the assembly of a purple-colored limbo line.
Cook exuberantly motioned his teammates over, as offensive linemen Tom Compton and Rashod Hill stood facing each other and wide receiver Adam Thielen was hoisted in the air to serve as the bar. Cook, wide receiver Stefon Diggs and offensive lineman Brian O’Neill each strutted through, with their backs bent backward to try to slide underneath Thielen without touching him.
“It was supposed to be the lightest guy on the field. Diggs was supposed to be up there, but Dalvin really wanted to do it, so I jumped up,” Thielen said.
Said Cook: “I knew Diggs needed to be the one that comes behind me, because he’s more of the dancer.”
Quarterback Kirk Cousins was impressed, though not enough to find a place in line.
“When I heard they were going to do it I thought, ‘That one is going to be a tough one to pull together in 10 seconds,'” Cousins said. “But they did it. It was pretty good.”

Miami Dolphins defensive end Andre Branch says he’s going to start flopping to draw the attention of officials when he’s held.
“I saw J.J. Watt fall over, so I’m going to start doing that,” Branch said. “It’s time for me. I’m pulling out the Vlade Divac.”
His latest source of frustration: Colts left tackle Anthony Castonzo wasn’t called for holding Branch on a key play late in the Colts comeback win over the Dolphins last week.
The video replay was tough to swallow, Branch said.
“I jumped and I got pulled back,” he said. “That was the play of the game.”

Some pro football washouts as quarterbacks might have another avenue back to the NFL: They now have teams in the Alliance of American Football.
The Alliance, with eight teams that will begin play the week after the Super Bowl, conducted a four-round draft of only quarterbacks. Josh Johnson, who has made many stops in the NFL, was the top selection, by San Diego.
Other players who have been on NFL rosters, whether in the regular season or preseason, were selected or protected by their regional franchise and will head to a league training camp in early January. Among those were Aaron Murray and Matt Simms by the Atlanta Legends; Garrett Gilbert and Stephen Morris by the Orlando Apollos; B.J.

The Minnesota Vikings have been at the forefront of the creativity around the league since the celebration rules were relaxed last season to allow for more group play in the end zone.
In a game at Chicago last year, the Vikings initiated a game of “Duck, Duck, Goose” (or “Duck, Duck, Gray Duck,” as it’s called in Minnesota) after a touchdown reception by Kyle Rudolph. In their game against Green Bay last weekend, Dalvin Cook‘s catch, run and score prompted the assembly of a purple-colored limbo line.
Cook exuberantly motioned his teammates over, as offensive linemen Tom Compton and Rashod Hill stood facing each other and wide receiver Adam Thielen was hoisted in the air to serve as the bar. Cook, wide receiver Stefon Diggs and offensive lineman Brian O’Neill each strutted through, with their backs bent backward to try to slide underneath Thielen without touching him.
“It was supposed to be the lightest guy on the field. Diggs was supposed to be up there, but Dalvin really wanted to do it, so I jumped up,” Thielen said.
Said Cook: “I knew Diggs needed to be the one that comes behind me, because he’s more of the dancer.”
Quarterback Kirk Cousins was impressed, though not enough to find a place in line.
“When I heard they were going to do it I thought, ‘That one is going to be a tough one to pull together in 10 seconds,'” Cousins said. “But they did it. It was pretty good.”

		











GETTING THEATRICAL
Miami Dolphins defensive end Andre Branch says he’s going to start flopping to draw the attention of officials when he’s held.
“I saw J.J. Watt fall over, so I’m going to start doing that,” Branch said. “It’s time for me. I’m pulling out the Vlade Divac.”
His latest source of frustration: Colts left tackle Anthony Castonzo wasn’t called for holding Branch on a key play late in the Colts comeback win over the Dolphins last week.
The video replay was tough to swallow, Branch said.
“I jumped and I got pulled back,” he said. “That was the play of the game.”
ALLIANCE QBS
Some pro football washouts as quarterbacks might have another avenue back to the NFL: They now have teams in the Alliance of American Football.
The Alliance, with eight teams that will begin play the week after the Super Bowl, conducted a four-round draft of only quarterbacks. Josh Johnson, who has made many stops in the NFL, was the top selection, by San Diego.
Other players who have been on NFL rosters, whether in the regular season or preseason, were selected or protected by their regional franchise and will head to a league training camp in early January. Among those were Aaron Murray and Matt Simms by the Atlanta Legends; Garrett Gilbert and Stephen Morris by the Orlando Apollos; B.J. Daniels by the Salt Lake Stallions; Christian Hackenberg and Zach Mettenberg by the Memphis Express; and Scott Tolzien by the Birmingham Iron. “I have no words for it,” said Roberson, who broke into tears.
Mahomes is arguably the hottest player in the NFL this season, his record-setting performance as a first-year starter helping the Chiefs to a 9-2 record. And not surprisingly, that has caused the demands on his time to skyrocket, from the unending interview requests to meet-and-greets and other events.
Somehow, the 23-year-old quarterback has managed to take everything in stride.
“I don’t know if it does something for me. It’s just part of being in this community,” Mahomes said the following day, before stepping onto the practice field to prepare for Sunday’s trip to Oakland.

“This community loves football and they love each other,” Mahomes continued. “It’s more than just football. It’s being a good person and giving back to the community.”
Mahomes has certainly ingrained himself in the community.
He threw out a first pitch at a Royals game over the summer. He was the grand marshal for the NASCAR race, wearing a cutoff jersey from the T-Bones, the local minor league baseball team. He pops up at stores, concerts and restaurants as if he was anybody else, even sitting front row at Sprint Center last week to watch his college, Texas Tech, play in the Hall of Fame Classic basketball tournament.
When he showed up at a Verizon store on Monday for a meet-and-greet, store officials were worried the crowd would be too large and asked that his appearance not be publicized. Several hundred people still found out, forming a line that snaked around the building as they awaited his arrival.
“I feel the excitement and I feel the love not only for me but for the Kansas City Chiefs,” Mahomes said. “It’s special. This is a special place. There’s great people here. That’s one of the main reasons I love playing for this team.”
VON’S KITS
Von Miller is leading a $200,000 initiative to provide protective kits to first responders in mass shootings and improve local law enforcement relations.
The donation from Miller, his teammates and the organization to SHIELD616, a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit organization, will provide more than 125 advanced protective kits for police and firefighters responding to active shooter or mass shooting situations.
“It’s been 300 mass shootings this year, and I’ve only heard about four. When I was hit with that information, it really hit home for me,” Miller said. “I’ve got personal ties with Colorado — of course, we had the shooting here at the theater my second year in the league — and really heavy ties in Dallas. It was what, two years ago that we had the shooting there.”
Miller said his best friend is a police officer in Arlington, Texas, “so I can help him and some of his colleagues with some of these vests. It’s a real cool deal, the 616 initiative.”
Miller spoke up at a team meeting last week to get his teammates on board with the initiative, and nearly 20 players pitched in, as did team president Joe Ellis, general manager John Elway, and coach Vance Joseph.

		











SHIELD616 kits include a ballistic vest and helmet, along with a wound trauma kit, that upgrade standard equipment to protect against automatic weapons and assault rifles.
The initiative also allows for donors to contact the first responders they are helping protect to foster ongoing relationships, the Broncos said.
“It takes the unification of an entire community to not only better protect our first responders with physical armor, but to break down barriers between first responders and the citizens they serve,” said SHIELD616 President Jake Skifstad, a former police officer who founded the organization in 2015.
“It’s priceless to see complete strangers invest in the safety of first responders, changing their lives and the lives of their families,” Skifstad said. “We are humbled and proud to see that Von Miller, his teammates and the Broncos are utilizing their God-given leadership gifts and influence to not only better protect our protectors, but to also help build positive community relations.”
Joseph said he was proud of Miller for leading the initiative.
“Von is a special person. He wants to help people,” Joseph said. “He’s a great teammate and he’s great in the community. This is huge for Von to provide resources for our first responders. Obviously there have been a number of shootings in our country. It’s a huge issue.”
DAK THE DUCKLING
Dak Prescott’s first game with Drew Brees on the other sideline was a chance for the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year to reflect on the Pro Bowl trip they shared during that magical year for the Dallas quarterback.
Prescott had just led the Cowboys to an NFC-best 13 wins, while Brees got his 10th Pro Bowl nod following his record fifth 5,000-yard season. New Orleans had missed the playoffs for the third straight year, all 7-9 finishes. Prescott, who grew up in Louisiana, wasn’t thinking about those Saints records. He was thinking about Brees’ records.
“You do everything you can,” Prescott said when asked if he picked Brees’ brain during those few days together. “Like a little duckling. You just follow Drew Brees and just figure out what he does, how he does stuff. I was thankful to have him. Drew opened up and he shared some things.”
Prescott also noticed how Brees responded to those three straight losing seasons. With the 39-year-old having one of his best seasons in 2018, the Saints are on the verge of their second straight trip to the playoffs after winning 11 games last season.
“He’s taking care of his body, has done all the right things,” Prescott said. “Especially facing adversity, facing the middle of his career and some people were saying he wouldn’t do what he has done now. It just speaks to the character of that guy.”

Quarterback Kirk Cousins was impressed, though not enough to find a place in line.
“When I heard they were going to do it I thought, ‘That one is going to be a tough one to pull together in 10 seconds,'” Cousins said. “But they did it. It was pretty good.”

		











GETTING THEATRICAL
Miami Dolphins defensive end Andre Branch says he’s going to start flopping to draw the attention of officials when he’s held.
“I saw J.J. Watt fall over, so I’m going to start doing that,” Branch said. “It’s time for me. I’m pulling out the Vlade Divac.”
His latest source of frustration: Colts left tackle Anthony Castonzo wasn’t called for holding Branch on a key play late in the Colts comeback win over the Dolphins last week.
The video replay was tough to swallow, Branch said.
“I jumped and I got pulled back,” he said. “That was the play of the game.”
ALLIANCE QBS
Some pro football washouts as quarterbacks might have another avenue back to the NFL: They now have teams in the Alliance of American Football.
The Alliance, with eight teams that will begin play the week after the Super Bowl, conducted a four-round draft of only quarterbacks. Josh Johnson, who has made many stops in the NFL, was the top selection, by San Diego.
Other players who have been on NFL rosters, whether in the regular season or preseason, were selected or protected by their regional franchise and will head to a league training camp in early January. Among those were Aaron Murray and Matt Simms by the Atlanta Legends; Garrett Gilbert and Stephen Morris by the Orlando Apollos; B.J. Daniels by the Salt Lake Stallions; Christian Hackenberg and Zach Mettenberg by the Memphis Express; and Scott Tolzien by the Birmingham Iron. “This community loves football and they love each other,” Mahomes continued. “It’s more than just football. It’s being a good person and giving back to the community.”
Mahomes has certainly ingrained himself in the community.
He threw out a first pitch at a Royals game over the summer. He was the grand marshal for the NASCAR race, wearing a cutoff jersey from the T-Bones, the local minor league baseball team. He pops up at stores, concerts and restaurants as if he was anybody else, even sitting front row at Sprint Center last week to watch his college, Texas Tech, play in the Hall of Fame Classic basketball tournament.
When he showed up at a Verizon store on Monday for a meet-and-greet, store officials were worried the crowd would be too large and asked that his appearance not be publicized. Several hundred people still found out, forming a line that snaked around the building as they awaited his arrival.
“I feel the excitement and I feel the love not only for me but for the Kansas City Chiefs,” Mahomes said. “It’s special. This is a special place. There’s great people here. That’s one of the main reasons I love playing for this team.”
VON’S KITS
Von Miller is leading a $200,000 initiative to provide protective kits to first responders in mass shootings and improve local law enforcement relations.
The donation from Miller, his teammates and the organization to SHIELD616, a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit organization, will provide more than 125 advanced protective kits for police and firefighters responding to active shooter or mass shooting situations.
“It’s been 300 mass shootings this year, and I’ve only heard about four. When I was hit with that information, it really hit home for me,” Miller said. “I’ve got personal ties with Colorado — of course, we had the shooting here at the theater my second year in the league — and really heavy ties in Dallas. It was what, two years ago that we had the shooting there.”
Miller said his best friend is a police officer in Arlington, Texas, “so I can help him and some of his colleagues with some of these vests. It’s a real cool deal, the 616 initiative.”
Miller spoke up at a team meeting last week to get his teammates on board with the initiative, and nearly 20 players pitched in, as did team president Joe Ellis, general manager John Elway, and coach Vance Joseph.

		











SHIELD616 kits include a ballistic vest and helmet, along with a wound trauma kit, that upgrade standard equipment to protect against automatic weapons and assault rifles.
The initiative also allows for donors to contact the first responders they are helping protect to foster ongoing relationships, the Broncos said.
“It takes the unification of an entire community to not only better protect our first responders with physical armor, but to break down barriers between first responders and the citizens they serve,” said SHIELD616 President Jake Skifstad, a former police officer who founded the organization in 2015.
“It’s priceless to see complete strangers invest in the safety of first responders, changing their lives and the lives of their families,” Skifstad said. “We are humbled and proud to see that Von Miller, his teammates and the Broncos are utilizing their God-given leadership gifts and influence to not only better protect our protectors, but to also help build positive community relations.”
Joseph said he was proud of Miller for leading the initiative.
“Von is a special person. He wants to help people,” Joseph said. “He’s a great teammate and he’s great in the community. This is huge for Von to provide resources for our first responders. Obviously there have been a number of shootings in our country. It’s a huge issue.”
DAK THE DUCKLING
Dak Prescott’s first game with Drew Brees on the other sideline was a chance for the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year to reflect on the Pro Bowl trip they shared during that magical year for the Dallas quarterback.
Prescott had just led the Cowboys to an NFC-best 13 wins, while Brees got his 10th Pro Bowl nod following his record fifth 5,000-yard season. New Orleans had missed the playoffs for the third straight year, all 7-9 finishes. Prescott, who grew up in Louisiana, wasn’t thinking about those Saints records. He was thinking about Brees’ records.
“You do everything you can,” Prescott said when asked if he picked Brees’ brain during those few days together. “Like a little duckling. You just follow Drew Brees and just figure out what he does, how he does stuff. I was thankful to have him. Drew opened up and he shared some things.”
Prescott also noticed how Brees responded to those three straight losing seasons. With the 39-year-old having one of his best seasons in 2018, the Saints are on the verge of their second straight trip to the playoffs after winning 11 games last season.
“He’s taking care of his body, has done all the right things,” Prescott said. “Especially facing adversity, facing the middle of his career and some people were saying he wouldn’t do what he has done now. It just speaks to the character of that guy.”

		











HOW LOW CAN YOU GO?
The Minnesota Vikings have been at the forefront of the creativity around the league since the celebration rules were relaxed last season to allow for more group play in the end zone.
In a game at Chicago last year, the Vikings initiated a game of “Duck, Duck, Goose” (or “Duck, Duck, Gray Duck,” as it’s called in Minnesota) after a touchdown reception by Kyle Rudolph. In their game against Green Bay last weekend, Dalvin Cook‘s catch, run and score prompted the assembly of a purple-colored limbo line.
Cook exuberantly motioned his teammates over, as offensive linemen Tom Compton and Rashod Hill stood facing each other and wide receiver Adam Thielen was hoisted in the air to serve as the bar. Cook, wide receiver Stefon Diggs and offensive lineman Brian O’Neill each strutted through, with their backs bent backward to try to slide underneath Thielen without touching him.
“It was supposed to be the lightest guy on the field. Diggs was supposed to be up there, but Dalvin really wanted to do it, so I jumped up,” Thielen said.
Said Cook: “I knew Diggs needed to be the one that comes behind me, because he’s more of the dancer.”

Von Miller is leading a $200,000 initiative to provide protective kits to first responders in mass shootings and improve local law enforcement relations.
The donation from Miller, his teammates and the organization to SHIELD616, a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit organization, will provide more than 125 advanced protective kits for police and firefighters responding to active shooter or mass shooting situations.

“It’s priceless to see complete strangers invest in the safety of first responders, changing their lives and the lives of their families,” Skifstad said. “We are humbled and proud to see that Von Miller, his teammates and the Broncos are utilizing their God-given leadership gifts and influence to not only better protect our protectors, but to also help build positive community relations.”
Joseph said he was proud of Miller for leading the initiative.
“Von is a special person. He wants to help people,” Joseph said. “He’s a great teammate and he’s great in the community. This is huge for Von to provide resources for our first responders. Obviously there have been a number of shootings in our country. It’s a huge issue.”
DAK THE DUCKLING
Dak Prescott’s first game with Drew Brees on the other sideline was a chance for the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year to reflect on the Pro Bowl trip they shared during that magical year for the Dallas quarterback.
Prescott had just led the Cowboys to an NFC-best 13 wins, while Brees got his 10th Pro Bowl nod following his record fifth 5,000-yard season. New Orleans had missed the playoffs for the third straight year, all 7-9 finishes. Prescott, who grew up in Louisiana, wasn’t thinking about those Saints records. He was thinking about Brees’ records.
“You do everything you can,” Prescott said when asked if he picked Brees’ brain during those few days together. “Like a little duckling. You just follow Drew Brees and just figure out what he does, how he does stuff. I was thankful to have him. Drew opened up and he shared some things.”
Prescott also noticed how Brees responded to those three straight losing seasons. With the 39-year-old having one of his best seasons in 2018, the Saints are on the verge of their second straight trip to the playoffs after winning 11 games last season.
“He’s taking care of his body, has done all the right things,” Prescott said. “Especially facing adversity, facing the middle of his career and some people were saying he wouldn’t do what he has done now. It just speaks to the character of that guy.”

		











HOW LOW CAN YOU GO?
The Minnesota Vikings have been at the forefront of the creativity around the league since the celebration rules were relaxed last season to allow for more group play in the end zone.
In a game at Chicago last year, the Vikings initiated a game of “Duck, Duck, Goose” (or “Duck, Duck, Gray Duck,” as it’s called in Minnesota) after a touchdown reception by Kyle Rudolph. In their game against Green Bay last weekend, Dalvin Cook‘s catch, run and score prompted the assembly of a purple-colored limbo line.
Cook exuberantly motioned his teammates over, as offensive linemen Tom Compton and Rashod Hill stood facing each other and wide receiver Adam Thielen was hoisted in the air to serve as the bar. Cook, wide receiver Stefon Diggs and offensive lineman Brian O’Neill each strutted through, with their backs bent backward to try to slide underneath Thielen without touching him.
“It was supposed to be the lightest guy on the field. Diggs was supposed to be up there, but Dalvin really wanted to do it, so I jumped up,” Thielen said.
Said Cook: “I knew Diggs needed to be the one that comes behind me, because he’s more of the dancer.”
Quarterback Kirk Cousins was impressed, though not enough to find a place in line.
“When I heard they were going to do it I thought, ‘That one is going to be a tough one to pull together in 10 seconds,'” Cousins said. “But they did it. It was pretty good.”

		











GETTING THEATRICAL
Miami Dolphins defensive end Andre Branch says he’s going to start flopping to draw the attention of officials when he’s held.
“I saw J.J. Watt fall over, so I’m going to start doing that,” Branch said. “It’s time for me. I’m pulling out the Vlade Divac.”
His latest source of frustration: Colts left tackle Anthony Castonzo wasn’t called for holding Branch on a key play late in the Colts comeback win over the Dolphins last week.
The video replay was tough to swallow, Branch said.
“I jumped and I got pulled back,” he said. “That was the play of the game.”
ALLIANCE QBS
Some pro football washouts as quarterbacks might have another avenue back to the NFL: They now have teams in the Alliance of American Football.
The Alliance, with eight teams that will begin play the week after the Super Bowl, conducted a four-round draft of only quarterbacks. Josh Johnson, who has made many stops in the NFL, was the top selection, by San Diego.
Other players who have been on NFL rosters, whether in the regular season or preseason, were selected or protected by their regional franchise and will head to a league training camp in early January. Among those were Aaron Murray and Matt Simms by the Atlanta Legends; Garrett Gilbert and Stephen Morris by the Orlando Apollos; B.J. Daniels by the Salt Lake Stallions; Christian Hackenberg and Zach Mettenberg by the Memphis Express; and Scott Tolzien by the Birmingham Iron. VON’S KITS
Von Miller is leading a $200,000 initiative to provide protective kits to first responders in mass shootings and improve local law enforcement relations.
The donation from Miller, his teammates and the organization to SHIELD616, a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit organization, will provide more than 125 advanced protective kits for police and firefighters responding to active shooter or mass shooting situations.
“It’s been 300 mass shootings this year, and I’ve only heard about four. When I was hit with that information, it really hit home for me,” Miller said. “I’ve got personal ties with Colorado — of course, we had the shooting here at the theater my second year in the league — and really heavy ties in Dallas. It was what, two years ago that we had the shooting there.”
Miller said his best friend is a police officer in Arlington, Texas, “so I can help him and some of his colleagues with some of these vests. It’s a real cool deal, the 616 initiative.”
Miller spoke up at a team meeting last week to get his teammates on board with the initiative, and nearly 20 players pitched in, as did team president Joe Ellis, general manager John Elway, and coach Vance Joseph.

		











SHIELD616 kits include a ballistic vest and helmet, along with a wound trauma kit, that upgrade standard equipment to protect against automatic weapons and assault rifles.
The initiative also allows for donors to contact the first responders they are helping protect to foster ongoing relationships, the Broncos said.
“It takes the unification of an entire community to not only better protect our first responders with physical armor, but to break down barriers between first responders and the citizens they serve,” said SHIELD616 President Jake Skifstad, a former police officer who founded the organization in 2015.
“It’s priceless to see complete strangers invest in the safety of first responders, changing their lives and the lives of their families,” Skifstad said. “We are humbled and proud to see that Von Miller, his teammates and the Broncos are utilizing their God-given leadership gifts and influence to not only better protect our protectors, but to also help build positive community relations.”

“He’s taking care of his body, has done all the right things,” Prescott said. “Especially facing adversity, facing the middle of his career and some people were saying he wouldn’t do what he has done now. It just speaks to the character of that guy.”

		











HOW LOW CAN YOU GO?
The Minnesota Vikings have been at the forefront of the creativity around the league since the celebration rules were relaxed last season to allow for more group play in the end zone.
In a game at Chicago last year, the Vikings initiated a game of “Duck, Duck, Goose” (or “Duck, Duck, Gray Duck,” as it’s called in Minnesota) after a touchdown reception by Kyle Rudolph. In their game against Green Bay last weekend, Dalvin Cook‘s catch, run and score prompted the assembly of a purple-colored limbo line.
Cook exuberantly motioned his teammates over, as offensive linemen Tom Compton and Rashod Hill stood facing each other and wide receiver Adam Thielen was hoisted in the air to serve as the bar. Cook, wide receiver Stefon Diggs and offensive lineman Brian O’Neill each strutted through, with their backs bent backward to try to slide underneath Thielen without touching him.
“It was supposed to be the lightest guy on the field. Diggs was supposed to be up there, but Dalvin really wanted to do it, so I jumped up,” Thielen said.
Said Cook: “I knew Diggs needed to be the one that comes behind me, because he’s more of the dancer.”
Quarterback Kirk Cousins was impressed, though not enough to find a place in line.
“When I heard they were going to do it I thought, ‘That one is going to be a tough one to pull together in 10 seconds,'” Cousins said. “But they did it. It was pretty good.”

		











GETTING THEATRICAL
Miami Dolphins defensive end Andre Branch says he’s going to start flopping to draw the attention of officials when he’s held.
“I saw J.J. Watt fall over, so I’m going to start doing that,” Branch said. “It’s time for me. I’m pulling out the Vlade Divac.”
His latest source of frustration: Colts left tackle Anthony Castonzo wasn’t called for holding Branch on a key play late in the Colts comeback win over the Dolphins last week.
The video replay was tough to swallow, Branch said.
“I jumped and I got pulled back,” he said. “That was the play of the game.”
ALLIANCE QBS
Some pro football washouts as quarterbacks might have another avenue back to the NFL: They now have teams in the Alliance of American Football.
The Alliance, with eight teams that will begin play the week after the Super Bowl, conducted a four-round draft of only quarterbacks. Josh Johnson, who has made many stops in the NFL, was the top selection, by San Diego.
Other players who have been on NFL rosters, whether in the regular season or preseason, were selected or protected by their regional franchise and will head to a league training camp in early January. Among those were Aaron Murray and Matt Simms by the Atlanta Legends; Garrett Gilbert and Stephen Morris by the Orlando Apollos; B.J. Daniels by the Salt Lake Stallions; Christian Hackenberg and Zach Mettenberg by the Memphis Express; and Scott Tolzien by the Birmingham Iron. Miller spoke up at a team meeting last week to get his teammates on board with the initiative, and nearly 20 players pitched in, as did team president Joe Ellis, general manager John Elway, and coach Vance Joseph.

		











SHIELD616 kits include a ballistic vest and helmet, along with a wound trauma kit, that upgrade standard equipment to protect against automatic weapons and assault rifles.
The initiative also allows for donors to contact the first responders they are helping protect to foster ongoing relationships, the Broncos said.
“It takes the unification of an entire community to not only better protect our first responders with physical armor, but to break down barriers between first responders and the citizens they serve,” said SHIELD616 President Jake Skifstad, a former police officer who founded the organization in 2015.
“It’s priceless to see complete strangers invest in the safety of first responders, changing their lives and the lives of their families,” Skifstad said. “We are humbled and proud to see that Von Miller, his teammates and the Broncos are utilizing their God-given leadership gifts and influence to not only better protect our protectors, but to also help build positive community relations.”
Joseph said he was proud of Miller for leading the initiative.
“Von is a special person. He wants to help people,” Joseph said. “He’s a great teammate and he’s great in the community. This is huge for Von to provide resources for our first responders. Obviously there have been a number of shootings in our country. It’s a huge issue.”
DAK THE DUCKLING
Dak Prescott’s first game with Drew Brees on the other sideline was a chance for the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year to reflect on the Pro Bowl trip they shared during that magical year for the Dallas quarterback.
Prescott had just led the Cowboys to an NFC-best 13 wins, while Brees got his 10th Pro Bowl nod following his record fifth 5,000-yard season. New Orleans had missed the playoffs for the third straight year, all 7-9 finishes. Prescott, who grew up in Louisiana, wasn’t thinking about those Saints records. He was thinking about Brees’ records.
“You do everything you can,” Prescott said when asked if he picked Brees’ brain during those few days together. “Like a little duckling. You just follow Drew Brees and just figure out what he does, how he does stuff. I was thankful to have him. Drew opened up and he shared some things.”

“I jumped and I got pulled back,” he said. “That was the play of the game.”

Some pro football washouts as quarterbacks might have another avenue back to the NFL: They now have teams in the Alliance of American Football.
The Alliance, with eight teams that will begin play the week after the Super Bowl, conducted a four-round draft of only quarterbacks. Josh Johnson, who has made many stops in the NFL, was the top selection, by San Diego.
Other players who have been on NFL rosters, whether in the regular season or preseason, were selected or protected by their regional franchise and will head to a league training camp in early January. Among those were Aaron Murray and Matt Simms by the Atlanta Legends; Garrett Gilbert and Stephen Morris by the Orlando Apollos; B.J. Daniels by the Salt Lake Stallions; Christian Hackenberg and Zach Mettenberg by the Memphis Express; and Scott Tolzien by the Birmingham Iron. “Von is a special person. He wants to help people,” Joseph said. “He’s a great teammate and he’s great in the community. This is huge for Von to provide resources for our first responders. Obviously there have been a number of shootings in our country. It’s a huge issue.”
DAK THE DUCKLING
Dak Prescott’s first game with Drew Brees on the other sideline was a chance for the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year to reflect on the Pro Bowl trip they shared during that magical year for the Dallas quarterback.
Prescott had just led the Cowboys to an NFC-best 13 wins, while Brees got his 10th Pro Bowl nod following his record fifth 5,000-yard season. New Orleans had missed the playoffs for the third straight year, all 7-9 finishes. Prescott, who grew up in Louisiana, wasn’t thinking about those Saints records. He was thinking about Brees’ records.
“You do everything you can,” Prescott said when asked if he picked Brees’ brain during those few days together. “Like a little duckling. You just follow Drew Brees and just figure out what he does, how he does stuff. I was thankful to have him. Drew opened up and he shared some things.”
Prescott also noticed how Brees responded to those three straight losing seasons. With the 39-year-old having one of his best seasons in 2018, the Saints are on the verge of their second straight trip to the playoffs after winning 11 games last season.
“He’s taking care of his body, has done all the right things,” Prescott said. “Especially facing adversity, facing the middle of his career and some people were saying he wouldn’t do what he has done now. It just speaks to the character of that guy.”

		











HOW LOW CAN YOU GO?
The Minnesota Vikings have been at the forefront of the creativity around the league since the celebration rules were relaxed last season to allow for more group play in the end zone.
In a game at Chicago last year, the Vikings initiated a game of “Duck, Duck, Goose” (or “Duck, Duck, Gray Duck,” as it’s called in Minnesota) after a touchdown reception by Kyle Rudolph. In their game against Green Bay last weekend, Dalvin Cook‘s catch, run and score prompted the assembly of a purple-colored limbo line.
Cook exuberantly motioned his teammates over, as offensive linemen Tom Compton and Rashod Hill stood facing each other and wide receiver Adam Thielen was hoisted in the air to serve as the bar. Cook, wide receiver Stefon Diggs and offensive lineman Brian O’Neill each strutted through, with their backs bent backward to try to slide underneath Thielen without touching him.
“It was supposed to be the lightest guy on the field. Diggs was supposed to be up there, but Dalvin really wanted to do it, so I jumped up,” Thielen said.
Said Cook: “I knew Diggs needed to be the one that comes behind me, because he’s more of the dancer.”
Quarterback Kirk Cousins was impressed, though not enough to find a place in line.
“When I heard they were going to do it I thought, ‘That one is going to be a tough one to pull together in 10 seconds,'” Cousins said. “But they did it. It was pretty good.”

Daniels by the Salt Lake Stallions; Christian Hackenberg and Zach Mettenberg by the Memphis Express; and Scott Tolzien by the Birmingham Iron. In a game at Chicago last year, the Vikings initiated a game of “Duck, Duck, Goose” (or “Duck, Duck, Gray Duck,” as it’s called in Minnesota) after a touchdown reception by Kyle Rudolph. In their game against Green Bay last weekend, Dalvin Cook‘s catch, run and score prompted the assembly of a purple-colored limbo line.
Cook exuberantly motioned his teammates over, as offensive linemen Tom Compton and Rashod Hill stood facing each other and wide receiver Adam Thielen was hoisted in the air to serve as the bar. Cook, wide receiver Stefon Diggs and offensive lineman Brian O’Neill each strutted through, with their backs bent backward to try to slide underneath Thielen without touching him.
“It was supposed to be the lightest guy on the field. Diggs was supposed to be up there, but Dalvin really wanted to do it, so I jumped up,” Thielen said.
Said Cook: “I knew Diggs needed to be the one that comes behind me, because he’s more of the dancer.”
Quarterback Kirk Cousins was impressed, though not enough to find a place in line.
“When I heard they were going to do it I thought, ‘That one is going to be a tough one to pull together in 10 seconds,'” Cousins said. “But they did it. It was pretty good.”

Miami Dolphins defensive end Andre Branch says he’s going to start flopping to draw the attention of officials when he’s held.
“I saw J.J. Watt fall over, so I’m going to start doing that,” Branch said. “It’s time for me. I’m pulling out the Vlade Divac.”
His latest source of frustration: Colts left tackle Anthony Castonzo wasn’t called for holding Branch on a key play late in the Colts comeback win over the Dolphins last week.
The video replay was tough to swallow, Branch said.
“I jumped and I got pulled back,” he said. “That was the play of the game.”

49,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/11/30/with-each-new-mass-shooting-san-bernardino-terror-attack-victims-worry-about-being-forgotten/,"Trending: Three years after the San Bernardino terror attack left 14 people dead, 22 with gunshot wounds and others suffering from PTSD, many of the victims have settled workers’ compensation claims or taken medical retirement. Few still work for San Bernardino County. Making matters worse, survivors say America’s continuing string of mass shootings has further haunted their lives. Workers’ compensation attorney Geraldine Ly said about 80 percent of her dozen clients who filed claims in the San Bernardino mass shooting “have sought or will be seeking” to take medical retirement. “They attempted to go back to work, but psychologically they just couldn’t do it,” Ly said. “The memories of their deceased friends are with them 8 to 10 hours a day” as they try to do their job, she said. All but one of the 14 who died in the Dec. 2, 2015, attack worked for San Bernardino County’s Environmental Health Services Division. Many of their colleagues in the room, including those not struck by bullets, suffered post-traumatic stress disorder. Authorities put the number of survivors at 57. They had gathered at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino for a training event and holiday party when co-worker Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, a health inspector, and Tashfeen Malik, his Pakistani-born wife, began shooting. Either before or after the attack, Malik, 29, had posted allegiance to ISIS on a Facebook account, authorities said. The Redlands couple died later the same day in a shootout with police.  The victims who lost their lives in the Dec. 2, terror attack in San Bernardino were: Robert Adams, Isaac Amanios, Bennetta Bet-Badal, Harry Bowman, Sierra Clayborn, Juan Espinoza,  Aurora Godoy,
Shannon Johnson, Larry Kaufman, Damian Meins,  Tin Nguyen, Nicholas Thalasinos, Yvette Velasco,

The Inland Regional Center Conference Center still sits gated on Wednesday, May 25, 2016 in San Bernardino. The conference center was the site of the December 2 terrorist attack that occurred in San Bernardino.  A memorial site at the corner of Waterman Ave. and Orange Show Road, just north of the Inland Regional Center Conference Center still exists on Wednesday, May 25, 2016 in San Bernardino. The conference center was the site of the December 2 terrorist attack that occurred in San Bernardino.  People gather at the memorial site on the corner of Waterman Ave and Orange Show Rd for the shooting victims on Saturday, Dec.05, 2015 in San Bernardino.  Survivors complained in the two years after the attack that San Bernardino County’s workers compensation review system denied or delayed needed medicines, procedures, and psychological care. The county insists it “went far above and beyond the call of duty in streamlining the flow of compensation and benefits.” The stances have not changed in 2018. Beyond that, survivors struggle with constant reports of new mass shootings, most recently the Oct. 27 attack by a gunman at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh that killed 11, followed by the Nov. 7 massacre at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, with 12 victims dead before the gunman took his own life. “As each one happens, the other one is being forgotten. There was a shooting at a synagogue just before Thousand Oaks, and then by Thousand Oaks, the synagogue is forgotten. These are scores of people being murdered, and each one before is forgotten,” said Julie Swann-Paez, 53, who was wounded in the San Bernardino attack. “There are some people now who don’t know about the Dec. 2 shooting, and it breaks my heart,” said Swann-Paez, who has taken medical retirement and moved last summer to Flagstaff, Arizona, with her husband and daughter. In a telephone interview, she said more former colleagues left the county workforce after the Borderline shooting. “One or two people who just decided they can’t do it. It’s just hard and the environment is not great for understanding” how a mass shooting can affect people who have been through one, she said. Ray Britain, 50, who was the county Environmental Health Services division’s interim chief at the time of the San Bernardino attack, still struggles to understand how a co-worker could do such a thing. “It was one of our own employees,” he said in a telephone interview. “He didn’t show any signs or symptoms; it was not a disgruntled employee — he never showed his cards to us. That was a big betrayal that we never saw coming.”  For those shot in the attack, workers’ compensation filings outline their terrible wounds in flat notes: “face-forehead, cheeks, eyelids;” “back – including back muscles, spine and spinal cord;” “neck, arm-elbow (head of radius, upper extremities, multiple parts…knee (patella), digestive system – (stomach)” read a few. Many also include “nervous system-not specified” and “nervous system-psychiatric/psych.” Of the 20 cases found in a search of state workers’ compensation court electronic files with known survivor names linked to the attack, nine had reached some kind of settlement by late November. Everyone who was in the room when the shooting started “has a major injury that will be with them for the rest of their lives,” said Britain of the PTSD. “What happened on Dec. 2 will change my life forever.” Of the 57 survivors, 42 had returned to work for the county at some point, San Bernardino County spokesman David Wert said in an email. As of late November, 14 were working full time — one had transferred to a different county department — five were working part-time with doctor-required work restrictions, 19 were out on medical leave and 19 had left county employment. Wert said it can’t be assumed that the attack is the reason for all of the job changes in the past three years. Some of those who returned and are currently off work may be so for reasons other than the attack, he said. And others may have retired, taken jobs elsewhere or “separated from the county for reasons other than the attack.” Britain, 50, who returned to work the day after the attack, said he lasted at work until about mid-January 2016. He is now medically retired. His personal estimate is that out of the 114 employees working in the Environmental Health Services Division at the time of the shooting, about 15 are still working full time. “They lost a whole division,” he said. “When I look back … I was operating on emotion after the event. I had an expectation that, ‘this happened at work, and we would be taken care of,’ ” he said. “It became very apparent that help was not to be provided, and we would be on our own,” he said. His application for psychological treatment under the county’s workers compensation program was initially denied, he said, but finally approved about a year later. Swann-Paez, who had part of her pelvis destroyed in the shooting, said a doctor’s request for a post-surgery home-care nurse late last year was initially denied, then approved — months after the need had passed. Several of the survivors went public with accounts of their struggles and said the county should have stepped past the workers’ compensation utilization review system, in which contracted outside physicians decide whether an injured person’s doctor’s medical request is necessary. Swann-Paez said part of her pelvis is gone, but the only classification for her wound under the workers’ compensation system was “fractured pelvis.” “They could not think outside the box, they could not treat this as an extraordinary situation,” she said of the county’s self-funded system. “The California Department of Industrial Relations investigated the workers’ comp issue in relation to the attack in 2016-2017, examined all documentation, and found delays and denials were extremely rare, were almost always upheld on appeal, and were attributable to failures by the survivors’ healthcare providers,” county spokesman Wert said in statement. He said the county created “new processes and enhanced benefits for the survivors” that received awards from the National Association of Counties and the California State Association of Counties. “The county would have had no motive to unnecessarily delay or deny treatment. Doing so would not have saved the county any money, time or effort,” he wrote. But Britain and Swann-Paez said some approvals were past the time of need for the survivors, who had to make do or find workarounds to get the timely treatment they needed. In 2017, Assemblywoman Eloise Reyes, D-Grand Terrace, introduced AB 44, a bill designed to allow workers or first responders hurt in a terrorist attack or workplace violence to bypass utilization review. The bill also would have extended benefits from two years to four and a half years. The language was stripped from the bill, but Reyes said in a telephone interview she is not done trying to address the issues through legislation. “The entire utility review process, we have known for years, is a problem for injured workers … and is something that needs to be addressed,” said Reyes, who was a workers’ compensation attorney before being elected. The issues for the Dec. 2 attack survivors, she said, “brought out more acutely the failings of the system. … My team and I are looking into ways that we can address this legislatively, to find just ways of treating victims in future incidents,” she said.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Stephen Paddock carried out the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Here’s what authorities know so far about the 64-year-old Nevada man. The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday announced that it would provide more than $16 million to aid those affected by the deadly Las Vegas shooting in October 2017 that left 58 people dead and hundreds more injured. The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history occurred when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from a room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino onto a crowd of concertgoers attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival. LAS VEGAS MASSACRE SURVIVOR DIES IN CALIFORNIA BAR SHOOTING Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who announced the funding during a speech in Cincinnati, was quoted in a news release saying that although the DOJ “cannot undo the harm” inflicted in the massacre, officials are “doing what we can to help Las Vegas heal.” Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker speaks during a news conference, Friday in Cincinnati. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) Since the shooting, the DOJ has given “$3 million to cover expenses for state and local law enforcement in Las Vegas and in Clark County,” Whitaker said in the news release. “Today we take the next step in providing more than $16 million for the victims of that tragedy and for the first responders who came to the scene, to help pay for counseling, therapy, rehabilitation, trauma recovery and legal aid,"" he said. LAS VEGAS MASSACRE SURVIVOR LEAVES HOSPITAL YEAR AFTER SHOOTING The total amount allocated -- Antiterrorism and Emergency Assistance Program funding -- is about $16.74 million, and is intended to help a slew of individuals including ticketholders, family members and law enforcement and medical personnel, the DOJ said. The funding will also ""supplement the massive outlays incurred by the Nevada victim compensation program,” according to the DOJ. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

53,https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/30/with-each-new-mass-shooting-san-bernardino-terror-attack-victims-worry-about-being-forgotten/,"Trending: Three years after the San Bernardino terror attack left 14 people dead, 22 with gunshot wounds and others suffering from PTSD, many of the victims have settled workers’ compensation claims or taken medical retirement. Few still work for San Bernardino County. Making matters worse, survivors say America’s continuing string of mass shootings has further haunted their lives. Workers’ compensation attorney Geraldine Ly said about 80 percent of her dozen clients who filed claims in the San Bernardino mass shooting “have sought or will be seeking” to take medical retirement. “They attempted to go back to work, but psychologically they just couldn’t do it,” Ly said. “The memories of their deceased friends are with them 8 to 10 hours a day” as they try to do their job, she said. All but one of the 14 who died in the Dec. 2, 2015, attack worked for San Bernardino County’s Environmental Health Services Division. Many of their colleagues in the room, including those not struck by bullets, suffered post-traumatic stress disorder. Authorities put the number of survivors at 57. They had gathered at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino for a training event and holiday party when co-worker Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, a health inspector, and Tashfeen Malik, his Pakistani-born wife, began shooting. Either before or after the attack, Malik, 29, had posted allegiance to ISIS on a Facebook account, authorities said. The Redlands couple died later the same day in a shootout with police.  The victims who lost their lives in the Dec. 2, terror attack in San Bernardino were: Robert Adams, Isaac Amanios, Bennetta Bet-Badal, Harry Bowman, Sierra Clayborn, Juan Espinoza,  Aurora Godoy,
Shannon Johnson, Larry Kaufman, Damian Meins,  Tin Nguyen, Nicholas Thalasinos, Yvette Velasco,

Swann-Paez said part of her pelvis is gone, but the only classification for her wound under the workers’ compensation system was “fractured pelvis.” “They could not think outside the box, they could not treat this as an extraordinary situation,” she said of the county’s self-funded system. “The California Department of Industrial Relations investigated the workers’ comp issue in relation to the attack in 2016-2017, examined all documentation, and found delays and denials were extremely rare, were almost always upheld on appeal, and were attributable to failures by the survivors’ healthcare providers,” county spokesman Wert said in statement. He said the county created “new processes and enhanced benefits for the survivors” that received awards from the National Association of Counties and the California State Association of Counties. “The county would have had no motive to unnecessarily delay or deny treatment. Doing so would not have saved the county any money, time or effort,” he wrote. But Britain and Swann-Paez said some approvals were past the time of need for the survivors, who had to make do or find workarounds to get the timely treatment they needed. In 2017, Assemblywoman Eloise Reyes, D-Grand Terrace, introduced AB 44, a bill designed to allow workers or first responders hurt in a terrorist attack or workplace violence to bypass utilization review. The bill also would have extended benefits from two years to four and a half years. The language was stripped from the bill, but Reyes said in a telephone interview she is not done trying to address the issues through legislation. “The entire utility review process, we have known for years, is a problem for injured workers … and is something that needs to be addressed,” said Reyes, who was a workers’ compensation attorney before being elected. The issues for the Dec. 2 attack survivors, she said, “brought out more acutely the failings of the system. … My team and I are looking into ways that we can address this legislatively, to find just ways of treating victims in future incidents,” she said.

55,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/arts/design/love-is-love-comic-trevor-project.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By George Gene Gustines “Love Is Love,” a 144-page benefit comic book that was originally published in 2016, has become a force in charitable giving. This year, sales of the anthology have raised $51,000 for the Trevor Project, a crisis intervention and suicide prevention organization for young gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer people. The donation will be presented on Sunday at a “TrevorLive” gala in Beverly Hills, Calif. The project was originally conceived by the comic book author and screenwriter Marc Andreyko to aid those affected by the mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., on June 12, 2016. Now, the proceeds will benefit different L.G.B.T.Q. organizations each year. “The Trevor Project is a wonderful organization that saves lives, so it is a privilege to make them the 2018 recipient of our donation,” Andreyko wrote in an email. “Love Is Love,” produced by IDW Publishing with the support of DC Comics, includes pages from the documentarian Morgan Spurlock, the actor Matt Bomer, the comedians Patton Oswalt and Taran Killam, as well as many comic book writers and artists. It costs $9.99. By March 2017, sales of the comic had raised $165,000, which was given to Equality Florida for the OneOrlando Fund that was set up for victims of the Pulse attack and their families. “That ‘Love Is Love’ continues to resonate with readers around the world and generate much-needed funds for the L.G.B.T. community is a testament to the powerful works the book contains and a beautiful way to honor the memories of those 49 lost at Pulse,” Andreyko wrote in the email. The book is currently in its sixth printing and is available via comic book stores, online booksellers and digital platforms.

Paul Sancya/AP/REX/Shutterstock Kid Rock has been removed from his duties as Grand Marshal of Nashville’s 2018 Christmas Parade, following backlash over comments he made during a television appearance on Friday morning. Replacing him in the honorary position is James Shaw Jr., better known as the Waffle House hero for his effort to thwart a mass shooting in Nashville in April. The move comes after Kid Rock made an appearance on Fox & Friends, which was shooting on location in downtown Nashville at Kid Rock’s newly opened Big Ass Honky Tonk Rock N’ Roll Steakhouse. Kid Rock live on Fox & Friends: 'Screw that Joy Behar bitch' pic.twitter.com/N2fYLqm4vL — Aidan McLaughlin (@aidnmclaughlin) November 30, 2018  After taking a swig of whiskey and giving an impassioned plea to host Steve Doocy about the need for people to come together and have calm, civil discourse, Kid Rock couldn’t leave well enough alone. “I would say, love everybody. . . except screw that Joy Behar bitch,” he said, forcing a flustered Doocy to repeatedly apologize for the artist’s language. Kid Rock quickly noted that he was joking, but stopped short of asking forgiveness. “I apologize for the language, not the sentiment,” he said. Behar was quick to fire back during today’s episode of The View: “This bitch and these bitches will be happy to have you on the show and have a beer,” she said. See Also

End of story,” he wrote. “I apologized for cursing on live tv, I will not for my sentiment nor do I expect an apology from her or anyone else who has choice words for me or doesn’t like me.” Problems began to escalate for Kid Rock when city councilman Freddie O’Connell tweeted that he wouldn’t be participating in the parade because the choice of Grand Marshal “evokes neither the spirit of Christmas nor the inclusivity I think represents the best of Nashville.” Nashville Mayor David Briley also noted that he was considering sitting out the event. “If Kid Rock is still the grand marshal tomorrow, the mayor is inclined not to participate,” Briley spokesman Thomas Mulgrew told Nashville’s WSMV. Parade organizers – which included Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt, Piedmont Natural Gas and Tennessee Holiday Productions – eventually issued a statement that Kid Rock would be replaced as Grand Marshal by Shaw, who tweeted about getting some exciting news early in the afternoon. Shaw became a local hero in April, when he charged at a gunman who had entered a Waffle House and started shooting. “I was just trying to live,” Shaw told the New York Times about tackling shooter Travis Reinking as he reloaded. Complicating parade matters further is Steve Smith, owner of Nashville honky tonk Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge and partner in Kid Rock’s bar. Smith is a co-sponsor of the parade through his various downtown entertainment properties, including Rippy’s and the Diner. He remained steadfast that Kid Rock would still be serving as the parade’s Grand Marshal. “If the city wants to refund me my quarter of a million, they can run the parade,” Smith told reporters. “He will be in the parade tomorrow and will be the Grand Marshal.” Later on, Smith backed off slightly, saying that Kid Rock would still be participating in the parade. Kid Rock has been no stranger to controversy in recent years. In 2016, he expressed his feelings about NFL players’ protests during the national anthem, saying, “Man, fuck Colin Kaepernick” at one of his concerts. The avowed Donald Trump supporter also teased a senate run in his home state of Michigan as a way to gin up publicity for his latest album, Sweet Southern Sugar. Over the weekend, the FEC dismissed complaints about Kid Rock’s political fakeout, saying he didn’t appear to have “taken even the most basic steps to become a candidate.” The 2018 Nashville Christmas Parade is scheduled to take place on Saturday (December 1st) at 8:30 a.m. CT.

        Gabriel H. Sanchez Posted on December 1, 2018, at 9:48 a.m. ET This is a somber and brutally honest look at the lives left shattered in the wake of a mass shooting in the US. With their own words, the survivors and family and friends of victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, share their testimonies of this senseless tragedy. Photographer Jeff Vespa captures each word with all its poignancy, but it’s the look of their faces as they recount their experiences that will stay with you long after you read this story. —Gabriel H. Sanchez, photo essay editor, BuzzFeed News There’s a lot in this feature that makes so much sense when reporting on children traveling with the migrant caravan in Latin America. For one, it’s the closest to a firsthand witness you can get. Taking away the third-party element in the scene gives a more authentic account of the event. This story allows young people to dictate the narrative, to represent themselves and their experiences, and that’s something we don’t get to see often. —Anna Mendoza, photo editor, BuzzFeed Australia Photographer Tabitha Barnard’s deeply personal work on femininity, sexuality, and Christianity is like a hauntingly beautiful fever dream. “Cult of Womanhood” features images of her sisters exploring their identities, their bodies, each other, and nature in a most visceral way. Over the course of six years, she documented them as they navigated their way from childhood to womanhood while living in a deeply religious community where sexuality and feminine growth was stymied. Through portraits and images often punctuated by the color red, Barnard’s images make clear that the forbidden offered more promise to her sisters than the familiar. —Laura Geiser, senior photo editor, BuzzFeed News This entire issue of Cal Sunday is a wealth of treasures. The photo essay by Carlos Chavarría on the number of homes that one foster kid had lived in I found particularly smart and haunting, while the Holly Andres series is a thoughtful behind-the-scenes look at the things that drive us crazy once we get in the door. Take your time and go through it twice; it’s worth it. —Kate Bubacz, deputy photo director, BuzzFeed News On the occasion of a retrospective on pioneer street photographer Helen Levitt’s work at Laurence Miller Gallery in New York City, the Guardian has shared a collection of some of her most revered images of New York City during the early 20th century. These pictures, as with much of her work spanning some 70 years, feel quick, unplanned, and raw. Levitt’s photographs have the uncanny ability to transport viewers into a casual stroll through another time and place. —G.H.S. This photo series is an important demonstration of the value of diversity and representation in photography, both in its subject as well as with the person behind the camera. Brian Adams knew the best way to portray the Inuits and how to hurtle past the tropes, simply because he is one of them. The result is a fresh look at what life is like for the indigenous people in Alaska, a people who dwell in modernity but are proud of their ancestry. —A.M. Add India’s Ghoramara Island to the growing list of disappearing islands and environmental refugees caused by the rising sea levels. The reality for the island’s residents is not a future concept, but something they are already staring in the eye. And there are so many of these islands that bear similar stories and face the same fates, many we’ll never hear about without the diligence of visual journalists who report back. —A.M. A focus on rehabilitation is considered an important step forward in modernizing a prison system based solely on imprisonment, and this work by photographer Brian L. Frank offers an intimate look at the paths of three young men passing through a rehabilitative prison camp. Frank’s images invite us into the lives and minds of these young men as they practice skills and focus on getting out. Once they are released, Frank shows us a slice of the life the young men inhabit on the outside, and as always, it’s a challenge to return back home to old friends and old habits. —L.G. First, this series on African photographers is incredible and worth watching as the creativity and energy in photography that has been coming out of the continent is undeniable and way too often overlooked. Second, this essay on Zinyange Auntony in particular is good because it shows some of the softer, more subtle scenes around the election and protests that rocked Zimbabwe this summer. Win-win. —K.B.

On Friday, as reported by the Inquisitr, Kid Rock (real name: Robert James Ritchie) was being interviewed in Nashville by a remote Fox & Friends crew when the subject of the tense and divisive mood in the country came up. Rock suggested that political correctness and a general sense of uptightness ruled the day, making it easy for people to be offended, and that things would be better if everyone just lightened up. Except for Joy Behar.""People need to calm down, get a little less politically correct and I would say you know, love everybody. Except, screw that Joy Behar b***h.""The remark caught the Fox & Friends hosting panel off-guard, so much so that co-host Steve Doocy apologized and chided Rock for the remark (""you cannot say that, we apologize for that."") Further, co-host Ainsley Earhardt also apologized when the cameras cut back to the show's studios in New York. Besides getting himself an immediate and on-air dressing-down from the Fox & Friends cast, it appears now that Rock's remarks have cost him his job as the Grand Marshall of Nashville's Christmas parade.BREAKING: Kid Rock out as Grand Marshal of Nashville Christmas Parade after controversial comments; replaced by Waffle House shooting hero James Shaw Jr.  https://t.co/xSgE8uNwV9— Joey Garrison (@joeygarrison) November 30, 2018Over in Nashville, parade organizers were quick to distance themselves from Kid's remarks. In a joint statement, parade sponsors Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Piedmont Natural Gas, and Tennessee Holiday Productions all said that Kid Rock's former job would go to James Shaw Jr. Shaw, for those not familiar, is considered a local hero in Nashville for having thwarted a mass shooting at a suburban Nashville Waffle House in April, according to Variety.""Parade organizers feel that the grand marshal should personify the spirit of the Nashville community and have invited James Shaw, Jr., who became a community hero after stopping a shooting at a local Waffle House earlier this year, to be honored.""Meanwhile, Rock has apologized - sort of - for the remark about Behar. On Facebook, Kid said he shouldn't have used naughty language on live TV, but that he will not apologize for his feelings about Behar.""I apologized for cursing on live tv, I will not for my sentiment nor do I expect an apology from her or anyone else who has choice words for me or doesn't like me.""Behar, for her part, invited Kid Rock to come to the View any time he would like to discuss things.

61,https://www.thewrap.com/nashville-christmas-parade-funder-threatens-legal-action-kid-rock-not-grand-marshall-video/,"""We are doing our due diligence and looking into legal options,"" Tootsies Orchid Lounge attorney said Friday night The attorney for Steve Smith, the owner of Tootsies Orchid Lounge and the majority funder of the Nashville Christmas Parade, said his client may take legal action over Kid Rock being booted as grand marshal of Saturday's event. Smith and Tootsies donates $250,000 to the annual parade efforts, Bryan Lewis said during a Friday night press conference, which he believes makes his client the ""majority stockholder"" of the event. Despite that status, Lewis says parade producer Tennessee Holiday Productions, which booted Rock from the honorary post after he called ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar a ""bitch,"" did not consult Smith in the decision. Rock was replaced in the role by James Shaw Jr., an electrical engineer hailed as a hero after disarming a rifle-wielding gunman during a mass shooting at a local Waffle House earlier this year.

""Kid Rock intends to show up tomorrow for the parade and be the grand marshal,"" Lewis told reporters Friday night. It appears that Rock did show up at the event but was not reinstated as grand marshal. The musician, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, posted the following Saturday morning on his Facebook page: Well folks, it is official...My parade has been rained on! But in the end, it is not about me. It is about the kids and the wonderful work they do at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital. Either way, myself, family and especially my granddaughter, are gonna enjoy today. Sending well wishes for a break in the rain and a successful parade. I love Nashville and the people she holds.

This week, Jews around the world will celebrate the miracles of Hanukkah. @FLOTUS Melania and I send our very best wishes for a blessed and Happy Hanukkah! https://t.co/LrnGcc86w4 pic.twitter.com/Kdjeyvkzmb — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2018 Hannukah (alternatively spelled “Chanukah,” a transliteration of the Hebrew “חָנֻכָּה”) celebrates the re-dedication of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem in the 2nd century B.C., after the Jews, led by the Maccabees, defeated the occupying army of the Seleucid Greeks and cleansed the sanctuary of pagan worship. Jewish tradition holds that when the Jews searched the Temple for oil to light the menorah, a sacred candelabra, they only found enough to last one day, but it lasted for eight. Jews observe the holiday by lighting candles (or oil lamps) on a special menorah — also called a “Chanukiah” — each night, adding a new light in ascending in order each night until the eighth night, when every light is ablaze. The holiday is associated with various other traditions as well. Many Jews eat delicacies fried in olive oil, including potato pancakes (“latkes”) or special jelly doughnuts (“sufganiot”). Children gamble for low stakes with special four-sided tops called “dreidels,” with each side marked with a Hebrew letter standing for the words in the phrase, “A great miracle happened there.” (In Israel, the phrase reads slightly differently: “A great miracle happened here.”) Friends and relatives often exchange gifts — typically “gelt,” small amounts of money or chocolate coins. (In the U.S., people tend to give larger gifts for Hanukkah, owing largely to the influence of the Christmas holiday.) Many Jews believe that it is essential to publicize the miracle of Hanukkah, and so many communities hold public menorah lightings. Doing so is seen partly as a symbol of communal survival in the face of centuries of persecution. In his greeting, President Trump made special mention of the recent mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh: Unfortunately, Jews today continue to face many different forms of violence, hatred, and bigotry around the globe.  We remember all those from the Tree of Life—Or L’Simcha Congregation—whose lives were tragically taken in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, this past October.  As one Nation, we pledge our continued love and support for the victims, their families, and the community, and we pray that the victims’ families find some measure of peace and comfort during this holiday season.

64,https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/583358270/0/alternet,"Each December, Time magazine announces its Person of the Year. It’s the individual (or group) who, “for better or for worse,” as the magazine puts it, had the greatest influence on the events of the year. This year, it should be no contest. The greatest influence in America this year came from Democratic women. Time has been choosing the year’s major person of influence since 1927, when aviator Charles Lindbergh graced the magazine’s cover for the first time. It was usually a Man of the Year (Wallis Simpson broke through in 1936 as the Woman of the Year because of her romance with British King Edward VIII, prompting his abdication). In 1999, the magazine realized it had better get with the times and designated the achievement as Person of the Year. Displaying his typical (yet undeserved) over-the-top egotism, Donald Trump announced that “I can’t imagine” anyone other than himself as Time’s Person of the Year. Timeusually picks the winner of a presidential election as Person of the Year, so he got the call in 2016, as did Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and other presidents before him. Too bad the public disagrees. In Time’s readers’ poll (no doubt social media-driven) on who should get the honor, Trump got only 2 percent of the vote. He was beaten out by 23 other candidates, including Robert Mueller (that’s gotta sting), Christine Blasey Ford, Michelle Obama (hey, her book Becoming outsold any of Trump’s books—bigly), Colin Kaepernick, and Jeff Bezos (owner of the “failing” Washington Post). Also getting 2 percent of support were Maxine Waters and Stormy Daniels—like that company, Trump? At least he got more votes than Melania. The top vote getter was the South Korean boy band BTS, so that’s how seriously we should take this survey. It’s fair to say that the people who had the most influence on the country this year were Democratic women. It’s not just one woman but a female Democratic collective: the candidates, the voters, the canvassers, the marchers, the resisters, the legislators. And they’re just getting started. The candidates: We’ve all seen and read the numbers: Emily’s List got inquiries from more than 42,000 women wanting to run for office in 2018, up from 920 in 2016. Out of that total, upwards of 5,000 received candidate training, and 500 were endorsed by Emily’s List. There was a record number of women running for state and federal office. In total, there were 235 women running for the House and 22 for the Senate. Of those, 182 House candidates were Democratic women and 15 Senate candidates were Democratic women. Not all of them won, but 60 percent of Democratic women won in House seats that flipped from red to blue. As a story in The New York Times put it: It is the most racially diverse and most female group of representatives ever elected to the House in its 116-year history. And it boasts an avalanche of firsts, from the first Native American congresswomen to the first Muslim congresswomen. … [M]any of the members of the freshman class [are] blazing a trail for other candidates of color. Several of the freshmen-elect are the first African-American women to be elected by their states, and voters in Kansas and New Mexico will send the first-ever Native American women to the House. With Nancy Pelosi (who raised boatloads of money for Democratic candidates to help them win) headed to another term as House speaker; Democratic women making more media appearances and becoming more influential on social media; and some Democratic women possibly gearing up for a 2020 presidential run, it’s clear that women legislators will have growing influence in coming months. Across the aisle, on the GOP side? Not so much—there were only four newly elected Republican women. The voters: Traditionally, more women than men turn out to vote, and that likely held true in 2018, although numbers are still being crunched. What is clear is that women boosted overall voter turnout to 49 percent in the 2018 midterms. Midterm turnout usually averages about 40 percent. The gender gap showed that 60 percent of women voted for Democrats, while only 47 percent of men voted blue. So all those new Democratic officeholders have women voters to thank: “Democrats won women’s vote for Congress by the largest margin seen in midterm exit polls” was a post-election headline in The Washington Post. There is further breakdown by age, race, and education level. According to another story in The Washington Post: White women without college degrees moved modestly toward the Democrats, more so than white men without college degrees. But a far greater proportion of white college-educated women swung to the Democrats, even beyond their previous support for Democratic candidates in previous elections. Key to the Democratic successes were the most reliable Democratic voters of all: black women. According to figures from Pew Research, 92 percent of black women voted Democratic, and they turned out in huge numbers, just like they always do. But they weren’t quiet about their role—they wanted to make sure candidates sought their input and spoke to them directly. Stacey Abrams knew that in Georgia. While she might have fallen short in the governor’s race (voter suppression was obviously a major factor), she knew she needed to court black women voters and talk about the issues most important to them. According to a story in Essence magazine: [Abrams] has been firm and consistent in her message from the jump, detailing plans to address health care and education, issues that she knows are important to Black women. “We are leveraging the enthusiasm and support of the African-American women’s community to motivate and galvanize the communities that they touch — and that means every community in the state of Georgia,” Abrams told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. And it is a level of outreach that has not gone unnoticed. Paula Benton, a resident of Stone Mountain, said that she is happy that Abrams is actively targeting black women. “It’s time black women started getting the recognition they’re getting,” Benton told AJC. “We’ve always been the backbone of everything.” Latinx women voters also played a big part: According to data from Pew, 73 percent of Latinas voted Democratic in congressional races. The marchers, the resisters, and the organizers: Millions of people—not only women, but a big majority of them were female—turned out in January 2017 to register their feelings about Trump’s presidency in a Women’s March that exceeded all expectations in marches across the country. The second march in January 2018 also attracted millions, with a focus on running for office and voting. All of that energy turned into the Resistance, but that’s only one part of it. After the Valentine’s Day mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17, masses of people—again, the majority of them women—joined local chapters of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Now, along with the affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety, it’s 5 million members strong. The organization backed candidates in state and federal races across the nation, registering voters, knocking on doors, phonebanking, and performing other GOTV efforts. The gun reform groups proudly claimed after the election that their volunteers had helped to deliver a “gun sense majority” to the House. No surprise: Nearly all of the people wearing those recognizable red T-shirts are women. And just in case you were wondering, there already are plans for a Women’s March on January 19, 2019, which is being dubbed the #WomensWave. It makes sense: The Blue Wave wouldn’t have been possible without a Women’s Wave. All of the energy from Democratic women was the driving force in taking back the House and in electoral wins across the country at all levels. And whether or not the editors at Time take my advice in naming the Democratic woman as the Person of the Year, I can’t wait to see what Democratic women accomplish in 2019 and beyond.   So do we.

Rabbi Jeffrey Myers watches the installation of a menorah outside the Tree of Life Synagogue before holding a celebration on the first night of Hanukkah, Sunday, Dec. 2, 2018, in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. A gunman shot and killed 11 people while they worshipped Saturday, Oct. 27, at the temple. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) PITTSBURGH – Sunday's public lighting of a Menorah outside a Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting was an opportunity to honor the dead, mark Hanukkah's theme of survival and allow the community to reinforce its solidarity. ""To me, it's a simple message: The light is the message,"" Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said, pointing to the Menorah standing at the corner where a makeshift memorial for the 11 victims once stood and was visited by thousands paying their respects. Five weeks after the massacre — believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in the U.S. — about 500 people gathered outside Tree of Life to pray, sing songs and witness the lighting of the Menorah. ""We are practicing our Jewish faith publicly and proudly,"" said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light, whose congregation, along with congregants from Dor Hadash and Tree of Life, had gathered at the synagogue when the shooting occurred Oct. 27. The fact that hundreds of people showed up for the ceremony came as no surprise to officials of the three congregations. ""I don't think there are enough adjectives to describe the community support,"" said Myers, who was leading Shabbat services at Tree of Life synagogue Oct. 27, when the shooting occurred. ""We're such a tight-knit community,"" said Ilana Kohanbash, who attended the Menorah lighting with her husband, Jason. ""It's also a wake-up call for what we need to do to keep our faith, and (that) we need to take precautions. It could happen to anybody."" The suspected shooter, Robert Bowers, raged against Jews during and after the shooting, authorities said. He remains jailed without bail, and has pleaded not guilty to numerous murder and hate crime charges. David Hausdorff, 53, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was in town on business and came to the lighting ceremony to show support. ""It's unfathomable, this act of violence,"" Hausdorff said. It's unconscionable in any house of worship, let alone in a neighborhood I grew up in. If I weren't here to actually see it, I wouldn't grasp the totality of the emotional devastation."" The Menorah lighting comes less than a week after the end of Shloshim, a 30-day mourning period observed by Jews following a death. ""We all begin the process of moving forward,"" said Ellen Surloff, president of Dor Hadash. ""You move forward one day at a time. You have good days and some not-so-good days."" Although the gunman targeted the Jewish community, Cohen cautioned that the shooting serves as a warning. ""The reality is it affects other religious communities, too,"" he said. ""We are coming together in comradeship and to help to see if we can work together. What happened here, clearly this is a sign, this is a signal and it can't be ignored.""

(Photo by Will Lester, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin/SCNG)  On a bright Sunday afternoon about 40 people gathered at Cal State San Bernardino to memorialize the 14 victims of the Dec. 2, 2015 terrorist attack, but especially the five who graduated from the school’s College of Natural Sciences. Friends, family, professors and at least one co-worker gathered to hear a bell ring 14 times — one ring for each victim — in the Peace Garden, a groomed outdoor space of trees, boulders, and a low wall, perfect for sitting and visiting. “Every year I come out here, I say the same thing, that somehow today will be easier than the year before. And it’s not,” Bill Van Dyke, an adjunct professor at the university, said before the bell-ringing, his voice breaking. Time does not take away the pain, he said. “Every year we come here and we feel the same thing and the hurt never stops.” Cal State San Bernardino and its College of Natural Sciences is intimately tied to the victims of the shooting. All but one of the 14 who died in the attack worked for San Bernardino County’s Environmental Health Services Division. They had gathered at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino for a training event and holiday party when co-worker Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, a health inspector, and Tashfeen Malik, his wife, began shooting. The Redlands couple died later that same day in a gunfight with law enforcement. The slain county health services workers who were Cal State San Bernardino alumni include Robert Adams (public health education, 2011); Juan Espinoza (biology, 2002); Shannon Johnson (environmental health science, 2004); Yvette Velasco (environmental health science, 2013); and Michael Wetzel (biology, 2001). Since 2016, when the garden was dedicated, each graduate who died in the attack has had their name and school information affixed to an individual plaque, one for each of the five sides of a slate-rock pedestal that serves as a base for a pole holding a memorial bell. It is rung 14 times, only once a year on Dec. 2, College of Natural Sciences Dean Sastry G. Pantula  said. The pedestal was laden with flowers Sunday, placed there by the visitors who either brought their own or took one offered to them as the arrived. One woman, who declined to give her name, was a co-worker in the room during the shooting, both she and Pantula said.  She placed a flower on each side of the pedestal. “I appreciate that the university has gone through the diligence,” said Michael Nguyen, 29, who took classes with Velasco and had the honor of ringing the bell. “This is such a small community. It’s hard to forget them,” he said of the natural sciences school. Nguyen, the environmental health and safety administrator for the San Bernardino Community College District, said the Cal State San Bernardino program has a reputation for producing highly sought environmental health specialists The losses “had a profound reach throughout Southern California, ” he said. Van Dyke, an  assistant district manager for the Corona-based Northwest Mosquito and Vector Control District, told the gathering to take comfort from the memorial. “We are here today to remember, and to allow our souls the time to contemplate the beauty and the grace we felt in the presence of the people we loved,” said Van Dyke. And the ceremony journeyed from tearful and heart-wrenching to warm and social, with the attendees staying long after the bell was rung. Children played and shouted amid the boulders while adults talked, hugged and visited along the sitting wall, which bears an inscribed quote from Albert Einstein, “Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.” Robert Velasco, 62, of Fontana, said he and his family come to the Peace Garden on occasions other than Dec. 2 to remember daughter Yvette, who was born on an Easter Sunday. The family has a picnic, and the young nephews play, as they did on Sunday. The ceremony was special, Velasco said, but “we remember her every day.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

Van Dyke, an  assistant district manager for the Corona-based Northwest Mosquito and Vector Control District, told the gathering to take comfort from the memorial. “We are here today to remember, and to allow our souls the time to contemplate the beauty and the grace we felt in the presence of the people we loved,” said Van Dyke. And the ceremony journeyed from tearful and heart-wrenching to warm and social, with the attendees staying long after the bell was rung. Children played and shouted amid the boulders while adults talked, hugged and visited along the sitting wall, which bears an inscribed quote from Albert Einstein, “Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.” Robert Velasco, 62, of Fontana, said he and his family come to the Peace Garden on occasions other than Dec. 2 to remember daughter Yvette, who was born on an Easter Sunday. The family has a picnic, and the young nephews play, as they did on Sunday. The ceremony was special, Velasco said, but “we remember her every day.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

68,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/583417444/0/phoenix/nation~aposThe-light-is-the-messageapos-Pittsburgh-synagogue-holds-Hanukkah-ceremony-at-mass-shooting-site/,"PITTSBURGH – Sunday’s public lighting of a Menorah outside a Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting was an opportunity to honor the dead, mark Hanukkah’s theme of survival and allow the community to reinforce its solidarity. “To me, it’s a simple message: The light is the message,” Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said, pointing to the Menorah standing at the corner where a makeshift memorial for the 11 victims once stood and was visited by thousands paying their respects. Five weeks after the massacre – believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in the U.S. – about 500 people gathered outside Tree of Life to pray, sing songs and witness the lighting of the Menorah. “We are practicing our Jewish faith publicly and proudly,” said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light, whose congregation, along with congregants from Dor Hadash and Tree of Life, had gathered at the synagogue when the shooting occurred Oct. 27. The fact that hundreds of people showed up for the ceremony came as no surprise to officials of the three congregations. More: Hanukkah 2018: When is the Jewish holiday this year? And isn't it spelled Chanukah? “I don’t think there are enough adjectives to describe the community support,” said Myers, who was leading Shabbat services at Tree of Life synagogue Oct. 27, when the shooting occurred. “We’re such a tight-knit community,” said Ilana Kohanbash, who attended the Menorah lighting with her husband, Jason. “It’s also a wake-up call for what we need to do to keep our faith, and (that) we need to take precautions. It could happen to anybody.” The suspected shooter, Robert Bowers, raged against Jews during and after the shooting, authorities said. He remains jailed without bail, and has pleaded not guilty to numerous murder and hate crime charges. David Hausdorff, 53, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was in town on business and came to the lighting ceremony to show support. “It’s unfathomable, this act of violence,” Hausdorff said. It’s unconscionable in any house of worship, let alone in a neighborhood I grew up in. If I weren’t here to actually see it, I wouldn’t grasp the totality of the emotional devastation.” The Menorah lighting comes less than a week after the end of Shloshim, a 30-day mourning period observed by Jews following a death. Opinion: Synagogue shooter hated Donald Trump and shows what real hatred, anti-Semitism looks like “We all begin the process of moving forward,” said Ellen Surloff, president of Dor Hadash. “You move forward one day at a time. You have good days and some not-so-good days.” Although the gunman targeted the Jewish community, Cohen cautioned that the shooting serves as a warning. “The reality is it affects other religious communities, too,” he said. “We are coming together in comradeship and to help to see if we can work together. What happened here, clearly this is a sign, this is a signal and it can’t be ignored.”",2018-12-02 21:29:04,&apos;The light is the message&apos;: Pittsburgh synagogue holds Hanukkah ceremony at mass shooting site,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

In addition the musical performances for which the artists donated their time, all of the food and drink from restaurants such as Nobu Malibu and Élephante was donated too.

Kelley, Contributing Photographer)  But mostly what stood out throughout the day was the warmth and community between friends and neighbors and strangers alike who came together to celebrate the resiliency of those from Malibu to Thousand Oaks to Calabasas who’d either lost a home or business or knew someone who had. “Tragedy strikes many communities all around the world and it takes the love of good people to get the community put back on track,” said singer Robin Thicke, whose home was lost in the wildfire. Thicke said he didn’t hesitate when producer and songwriter Linda Perry, another of the organizers, called. “Especially when you lose yourself you realize how many other people lost more,” he said. Singer Rita Wilson, who opened the show on Sunday, said as a lifelong Angeleno she’d grown up hanging out in Malibu and its beaches before settling there with her husband, actor Tom Hanks. “I love that this community came together so quickly,” said Wilson, whose home was not affected by the fires. The fires broke out the day after a mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill, also in Thousand Oaks, a venue Wilson had played just days earlier. “This community has been hit so hard,” she said of the one-two blow of shooting and fire. “The feeling was one of hopelessness, and then it turned into community.” One of the organizations the fundraiser will benefit, the Boys and Girls Club of Malibu, has already received some money  from the Malibu Foundation, the non-profit started after the fires to help all affected by the Woolsey Fire, said Kasey Earnest, executive director of the club which is helping with community wide relief efforts. Earnest came on stage between acts with two young people whose families lost homes and received emergency assistance grants already through the groups. “I lost a lot of things in my bedroom,” said Reghan Marlow, 10, whose family home in Coral Canyon was destroyed. “And I feel bad for my mom because she lost all of her pictures of her dad.” Reghan teared up as she spoke backstage standing with Earnest and Misael Espinoza, 23, a Boys and Girls Club staffer whose family of six lost their home in Encinal Canyon. “It’s been a rough couple of weeks,” said Espinoza, who like Reghan’s family had been helped by an emergency infusion of cash for living expenses. “It’s sad, I’m angry and upset, but as long as we have our family that’s all that matters.” Musical acts early in the day included Pete Molinari, Best Coast, Natasha Bedingfield and Dorothy. The evening ended with Joe Walsh, Brandon Boyd, Mike Einzinger and Ben Kenney of Incubus, Rick Springfield, Rita Ora and Macy Gray. The headliners and biggest crowd-pleasers came in the middle of the bill, starting with Katy Perry, who arrived in stage dress for Christmas — red leather skirt, green sweater and red ornament earrings — to perform songs such as “Roar” and “Firework.” After her three songs — everyone did somewhere between two and four — she stuck around for most of the rest of the day, signing autographs, taking selfies and giving out hugs to fans, and then just treating it like a backyard barbecue with a few thousand of her friends. When Alanis Morissette followed Perry to the stage Perry watched from the crowd, singing along with Morissette on “Ironic” like the fan girl she surely was when that song was first out. Morissette was great, warm and inviting, her full band adding Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins for one number. Watching from the side of the stage was Dick Van Dyke — who knew he was an Alanis fan? — whom Perry brought on stage after Morissette finished up with “Thank U.” “I’m what’s left of Dick Van Dyke,” the 92-year-old actor joked. “They needed an old person to represent all the old folks and I was the only one who could leave the house.” Then he got a little more serious, noting that in an era in which the nation is often bitterly divided an event like One Love Malibu is special. “If you’re worried about our country this is what it’s all about, this feeling,” Van Dyke said. After a beautiful set from singer Brandi Carlile, actress Demi Moore came on stage  before Gwen Stefani’s two numbers, both of them No Doubt hits. “This is what love can do,” Moore said. “This is what community can do, it’s amazing.” Stefani probably had the biggest crowd of the day. On a day where the audience had more celebrities than the stage — in addition to Moore you could spy actress Courteney Cox and actor Gerard Butler wandering around the field — Stefani had the biggest wattage in the spotlight of the stage. She sang “Underneath It All” to start as boyfriend Blake Shelton looked on from the wings, followed by “Don’t Speak,” during which someone’s toddler daughter crashed the stage and followed Stefani around as she sang, staring intently until Stefani finally picked her up and the kid waved to mom or dad off stage. Live and silent auctions were also part of the day’s events, with items such as a two-day SEAL training course for five going for $40,000 and a picture by Kanye- and Rolex-approved artist Wes Lang bringing in $10,000. But it was Perry, still having a blast, who stole the auction, walking out to offer her boyfriend actor Orlando Bloom’s services: a ride on the back of his motorcycle — “you holding him in a way that I am NOT excited about” — to a lunch date with Bloom. After revving up the crowd to the point that some woman named Laura bid $20,000 for the ride and lunch, Perry played dirty, announcing she was bidding $50,000 for her boyfriend’s services. Too bad for Laura, good for the benefit though. The Malibu Foundation will continue to collect donations even after the festival at malibufoundation.gvng.org. And these communities, places were longtime residents have always known the risks, will rebuild. “It’s just the Malibu spirit, to help each other,” said Dru Jacobson, who’s lived in the Point Dume area for more than 50 years. “This is lovely,” she said early on Sunday afternoon. “It really is a small town.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

70,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/03/lars-von-trier-on-filmmaking-and-fear-sometimes-alcohol-is-the-only-thing-that-will-help,"His new film, the typically shocking The House That Jack Built, is supposed to be the director’s big comeback. But his demons seem to have the upper hand Lars von Trier has a new film coming out and, no surprise, it is a full-blown assault on the senses. The House That Jack Built casts Matt Dillon, that 80s beefcake, as a smirking psychopath who views his killings as performance art and his grisly trophies as stand-alone installations. Jack kills without remorse, and seemingly without consequence, merrily bouncing from one atrocity to the next. There is a mass shooting in a sunlit meadow, sexual violence inside a cramped apartment and a scene in which a small boy cuts the legs off a duck. Von Trier’s story is intentionally brutal; it dares you to stick with it. But the shock of watching the film is nothing compared with the shock of meeting its maker. It is perhaps the fate of all enfants terribles to eventually slip up and be trampled – either by their own demons or by the weight of public opinion. But Von Trier has fallen harder than most and been steamrollered more thoroughly. For years, like his character Jack, the Danish director rolled the dice and rode his luck. He was the impish scourge of bourgeois sensibilities, a gleeful chronicler of so much human cruelty. Now he is physically spent and emotionally shot. His tussle with alcohol and depression has taken its toll. He believes his ill-starred 13th feature will be his movie swan song. “When I saw it on screen, I felt that very strongly,” he says. “It looked to me like some kind of last testament.”  We speak in May at a big, rented property in the suburbs of Cannes, Von Trier’s gated retreat from the festival fray. On the face of it, the place offers a serene haven. The director’s production staff are quietly tucking into their breakfast; David Bowie’s Heroes is playing at a discreet volume. But outside, the swimming pool pump has become detached from its moorings. It rears its head, like a snake, to spray water at the windows. The publicist thinks the machine has probably eaten some leaves and is puking them up. She shouts: “Keep away from the pool! The pump’s gone insane!” The director is sitting at a table behind a door marked “Private”, specs perched on his nose. The word “FUCK” is tattooed across his knuckles. His hands are shaking and his speech is laboured; he keeps losing his thread. Von Trier explains that the tremors are caused by antidepressants, although they may also be caused by alcohol withdrawal. He is largely sober these days, but recently fell off the wagon. “It’s hard to be in Cannes and not drink,” he says. Cannes, for better or worse, runs clean through the director, like lettering through a stick of rock. It has been the scene of his greatest victories and his worst defeat; his Agincourt and his Waterloo. He won the Palme d’Or for Dancer in the Dark, and sent the festival into uproar with the scandalous Antichrist. Then, in 2011, came an infamous press conference in which he airily joked about sympathising with Hitler. He was expelled by the organisers and subsequently investigated by the Danish police. Many saw this humiliation as the man’s just deserts. “The thing about Lars is that he always plays this game of teasing the grownups, pushing the boundaries,” his friend and fellow director Thomas Vinterberg told me afterwards. “And nobody ever said no to him until that day. He found his wall and it was right in front of him in Cannes, which I thought was beautiful. You couldn’t have written it better.” Von Trier begs to differ. The furore was horrible; it marks him to this day. “It was really tough,” he says. “Because I was persona non grata for seven years, and I was also threatened with five years in jail in Marseille, which, I think, neither you nor I would benefit very much from.” He didn’t seriously believe he was going to prison, did he? “Well, I’m easily scared. I’m sure that if two officers from your local police force turned up at your door, telling you how you were going to be handcuffed and taken to a cell, then you’d be scared, too. So it was a really hard punishment.” He gives a mirthless laugh. “I mean I never thought they would have me killed. But, yeah, it was painful.” The House That Jack Built is meant to be his triumphant Cannes comeback, heralding the return of the prodigal son. Instead, it becomes more akin to a public flogging. I think the film is tremendous: a baroque provocation, ironised and stylised in every aspect apart from its violence, which it shows as gut-wrenching and horrific, resolutely unglamorised. But most others disagree. Von Trier’s picture is described as vile, vomitous and vacuous. It prompts more than 100 walkouts at the morning screening. The director insists that the official premiere was better. He says: “The audience was kind to me, which was touching. When you get older, you get more touched by these things.” He gropes for his water glass as if lifting heavy furniture. His hands shake, and the water slops. The whole endeavour is almost too agonising to watch. Von Trier is only 62, but he carries himself like a man in his 80s. His health, he admits, remains a work-in-progress. “I’m working on my alcoholism, which is good. I had an eight-month period where I didn’t drink, and I’ll get back to that again soon. But I have this alcohol ‘tool’ that I use when I have to. And, if I have a really big anxiety attack, it’s the only thing that will help.” I am now wondering to what extent alcohol has influenced his career. Has he ever been drunk when directing his films? “Hmm,” he says. “Well, it depends on the form of the day. I mean, it’s not a spur to work; it’s only self-medication. But when you feel that level of anxiety you’ll do anything to push it away. So, sometimes it helps. It gives you the room to come out with what you already had in mind.” Von Trier likes to say that everything in life scares him except the content of his films. Directing, therefore, has been a means of harnessing his demons, of shedding light on dark corners. His greatest pictures (Dogville, Antichrist, The Idiots) amount to flayed human epics with all the nerve endings exposed. The danger is that the demons and darkness have a habit of spilling over into real life. Helena Bonham Carter turned down the lead role in Breaking the Waves because she decided the director was “a bit of a weirdo”. Paul Bettany had such a terrible time making Dogville that he refuses to watch the film. Von Trier, Bettany felt, was a control freak and an autocrat. “He’s a precociously brilliant director,” he says. “But he has no interest in what the actors think.” Off set, too, there have been other problems. Recently, the Danish authorities were called to investigate claims of sexual harassment at his film company, Zentropa. The organisation’s co-founder, Peter Aalbæk Jensen, reportedly groped the breasts of young interns and ordered them to strip at the office Christmas party. Jensen’s subsequent apology hardly did him any favours. He said he had always liked “slapping asses” and felt rather sad that he now had to stop. I suggest that what Zentropa bosses may have regarded as a culture of sexual liberation was a clear case of systemic abuse. But Von Trier, alarmingly, remains reluctant to condemn it. “Well, you know Peter,” he says. “He’s crazy. I’m crazy. Zentropa is crazy, to some degree. But when I look at the corporation – in this house, for instance – the young people are all having a good time.” He pauses. “I don’t even know what Peter is meant to have done.” “Slapped asses,” I tell him. “Slapped asses,” he says. “Yeah. But that’s what we all want to do. He’s living his dream. Yeah, it’s not OK. Nobody should be forced to do something they don’t want to do. That’s a very important rule. But I wouldn’t necessarily say that something wrong was done.” It would be helpful to cast Von Trier as an innocent bystander here. But the evidence suggests this may not be entirely true. Last year, Björk hinted, without naming names, that he had harassed her during the making of Dancer in the Dark. Specifically, the singer said that she received “unwanted whispered sexual offers … with graphic descriptions”. Von Trier denied any wrongdoing. I have also heard a story that he once stripped naked in front of Nicole Kidman. The director blinks. “I did what?” Stripped naked in front of Nicole Kidman. This would have been on the set of Dogville. Von Trier snorts. “Well, again, as with Peter, it sounds likely. But Nicole was ready to come back and do more films with me, so it can’t have shocked her very much.” Another snort. “But, yeah, it’s a crazy business. And it was a little bit our lives, as well. That’s where the films came from – that sense of freedom.” All of which may well be true. But freedom for whom and at the expense of who else? Dogville, incredibly, just turned a shade or two darker. Today, he accepts that the culture has changed. He can’t make his films in the way he once did, although he feels that this is more down to his own frailty than to a wider corrective in the world at large. He explains that he has obsessive-compulsive disorder; that he is not physically fit to be on set any more. In the future, he thinks he might make some short films. A few days here and there, nothing very taxing. Shooting a feature is too exhausting, too stressful. The House That Jack Built finally convinced him of that. I can’t quite believe this has always been the case. Von Trier’s best work is such an exuberant dance, so obviously fuelled by abandon and risk, it is hard to accept it was all born out of torment. There must have been one film that was pure pleasure to make. Von Trier mulls this over and recalls Melancholia. This was his acclaimed apocalypse drama from 2011, the film that indirectly landed him in all that hot water at Cannes. “Melancholia was the one where we had the most fun,” he says. “We were so drunk. It was a fantastic experience. We were all so drunk.” This is his problem in a nutshell. He associates the source of all pleasure with the very thing that may kill him. “Well, yeah,” he says, as though I have just remarked that the sea is blue. “But it was a very important part of that particular film.” He admits that his characters are alter egos of sorts. He was raging Charlotte Gainsbourg in Antichrist, depressive Kirsten Dunst in Melancholia, victimised Kidman in Dogville (possibly also wheedling Bettany, who becomes her main captor). So, it is no surprise that he feels an affinity with Matt Dillon’s Jack, who fondly believes he is getting away with his crimes, only to belatedly twig that he is being pitched straight to hell. Because, for all its anarchic spirit, Von Trier’s work inhabits a strict moral universe. It is a place of saints, martyrs and sinners. And if Jack comes to believe in the concept of divine retribution, it must follow that the director does, too. “No, no,” he says. “It is a picture, remember? The film implies that Jack has a romantic attachment to that notion. I really don’t – I’m not religious at all. But I did just read a book by Stephen Hawking, and he says this thing that has stuck with me. He says that we begin as stardust and we end as stardust. And that’s a liberating feeling – not in a religious sense, but in an emotional sense. I like the idea that there are multiverses. I like the photo from the Hubble telescope that defines the universe, that shows the stardust. That’s liberating for me. I take a comfort from that.” In the late 90s, he made a TV show called The Kingdom and installed himself as its master of ceremonies. Von Trier would appear in a tuxedo at the end of each episode, commenting on the action with a live-wire wit. He was ablaze with charisma, full of punk mischief, not entirely to be trusted. But that was a different man, another multiverse. Today, the director seems corroded, defeated. He says that it typically takes five years to emerge from a bout of depression. He estimates that he is about 18 months through the trip. Outside the house, the pump continues spewing water. The production crew have gathered poolside to observe its meltdown. I shake Von Trier’s hand and urge him to look after himself because I have rarely met someone so in need of close policing. “Yes, OK,” he replies. “I will try not to get drunk.” But, for some reason, this prospect strikes him as deeply amusing. He is still chuckling to himself as the door swings shut.

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The California Democratic Party has been rocked by a sexual misconduct scandal. I asked Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, about what’s ahead for the organization. As you wrote recently, these are heady times for California Democrats. Orange County turned totally blue in the midterms, and even Representative David Valadao, the last flippable Republican, seems likely to be out. But the state party feels a bit as if it’s in crisis. Why is that? The California Democratic Party has always been a bit of a caldron, filled with some of the most activist, liberal Democrats in the state. Unrest is kind of a state of being there. But last week, the party was roiled by sexual harassment allegations directed at its leader, Eric Bauman. Mr. Bauman originally said he would wait out an investigation into the allegations, which were raised by a party vice chairman, but when a Los Angeles Times article appeared detailing a series of accusations, he was out of there. Does Mr. Bauman’s resignation signal anything broader about the party or California’s political culture? And how likely is it that his resignation will pave the way for change? There is a lot of talk now that the kind of easygoing, roughhouse culture of a political committee — a culture that Mr. Bauman, who was very much a creature of the Bronx, reflected — will have to change. I think we can expect that to be a top pledge of whomever takes over the job. What about politically? Does the Bauman exit tell us anything about where the party might be going? Mr. Bauman squeaked into office by about 60 votes out of 3,000 votes cast. He was widely viewed as too moderate — and too old-school in his political tactics — for many in the party. His closest rival was Kimberly Ellis, a San Francisco Democratic activist and one of the leading contenders to succeed him. Keep in mind: The California Democratic Party is clearly more liberal than the state’s overall Democratic electorate. The party refused to back Senator Dianne Feinstein for re-election, supporting instead her more liberal challenger, Kevin de León, a state senator. She won handily. So we should be careful in drawing broad lessons about the politics in California from whomever is elected to succeed Mr. Bauman when the party convenes in San Francisco on May 31.

After seeing a local news piece about the couple, one woman volunteered her services as a wedding coordinator and caterer, enlisting Inday’s, a nearby Filipino restaurant, to provide a reception dinner of chicken adobo, jasmine rice and cucumber ginger salad. And on Nov. 24, the couple tied the knot after all. “There are angels walking around among us,” Mr. Best said. Read their whole love story here.

See Offers  SAD 54 officials have said on their website that the threat is not credible but have taken measures to increase security, including assigning an additional police officer to the school. Skowhegan police and school district administrators are taking seriously a threat posted on social media Sunday morning to have someone shoot up Skowhegan Area High School “and leave a few students in a bloody pool.” Police Chief David Bucknam said Monday morning that he added a police officer for security at the high school. School Administrative District 54 posted on its website that the threat is not believed to be credible, but they are not taking any chances. While there has been an apparent lull in school threats or in the reporting of such threats in Maine, names associated with the social media threat made to Skowhegan Area High School have turned up in previous investigations, namely several conducted by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office in Florida, which Bucknam said the police are investigating. A notification on the SAD 54 website reads, “As with all school threats, we take this very seriously and are following our regular school-day safety protocols. We believe our schools are safe. If you have any questions don’t hesitate to reach out to your school’s principal.” The threat is on the Facebook page of someone calling himself Osama Kingdata, but refers to another person called Jesus Wellington Kong as the one who would hire others to do the shooting. The first post appeared at 7:08 a.m. Sunday, Dec. 2: “Just a fact,.,,, I wouldn’t post the military I am joining on facebook,,,,because,,,,,i am the man that keeps threatening to shoot up skowhegan area high school and leave a few students in a bloody pool,,,,now and days shooting up a school is really cool,,,,if you ain’t shooting up a school you just ain’t cool,,,, yup and part of rules is temporarily shutting down a school,,,,” A second post six minutes later at 7:14 a.m. reads: “New video coming soon,,,.., from the man that not only threatened … a mass shooting at skowhegan area high school,,,, the man also has a promising military career,,,,,watch out ,,,, new video coming soon,,,,” The threat is the third in a string of violent, online postings this calendar year, the first of which forced SAD 54 schools to close in February. Schools were closed Feb. 28 after officials were alerted to a social media post showing an image of an AR-15 assault rifle accompanied by a threat. The post on Snapchat said, “Skowhegan, February 28, 2018 you’re all DEAD.” The post later was circulated on other social media sites. The image was of the AR-15 assault rifle, which is like the one used Feb. 14 in a Florida school shooting that killed 17 people, including 14 students. Three boys were taken away in handcuffs from Skowhegan Area High School in February after a second threat was posted on social media threatening violence. Two of the boys later were charged. Because they are juveniles, the names of the boys were not released. The boys in that case — one a Skowhegan Area High School freshman, the other a sophomore — were arrested and taken to the Long Creek Youth Development Center in South Portland. Both could have been charged with class C felony terrorizing, punishable as an adult by up to five years in prison, authorities said at the time. Bucknam said Monday that the courts and the office of probation are handling the cases, but could not discuss it further because of their age. Maeghan Maloney, district attorney for Somerset and Kennebec counties, said the juvenile code does not allow her to release information on adjudication of the previous Skowhegan school threats, except to say they were not charged in felony juvenile petitions. “They were not adjudicated on a felony,” Maloney said. “Meaning the court did not find them responsible for a felony.” Steve Bailey, executive director at the Maine School Management Association, said by phone Monday afternoon that he had conferred with Eileen King, executive director at the affiliated Maine School Superintendents Association and neither had heard of any other recent school threats. “We usually get word of those,” Bailey said. “There have been none that we have been aware of and certainly nothing recently, certainly as of today or last week.” The SAD 54 notification was posted on Monday at 09:43 a.m. “Good morning, Please be aware that the Skowhegan Police Department has been investigating threats made on social media by an individual who is believed to be out of state and have been working with state and federal law enforcement to follow-up. Police became aware of these threats over the weekend and as of last night, have been in regular contact with school administration. “The threat is not believed to be credible. As with all school threats, we take this very seriously and are following our regular school-day safety protocols. We believe our schools are safe. If you have any questions don’t hesitate to reach out to your school’s principal. Thank you, MSAD54.” The Orange County Sheriff’s Office investigators in Florida in August 2016 said they wanted to talk to Jesus Wellington Kong, 23, about similar threats made at schools in the Orlando area, according to a story on the clickorlando.com website. Deputies increased patrols around at least five schools that month after violent threats against the schools and their students surfaced online. Investigators said one of the threats made reference to shooting up a high school, while others involved planting pipe bombs at another high school and a middle school. Kong, who also goes by Jesus Henry Kong, Jesus Matute and Jessie Eloah Calix, is described by deputies as 5 feet 5 inches tall and 140 pounds, with a mole on his left cheek and burn scars on his hand and chest. He is a transient, but appears to move between California, Virginia, Maryland and Florida. A follow-up story in the Orlando Sentinel reported that a spokeswoman for the FBI said Kong was not a threat to the Orlando area. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Orlando declined to press charges. Bucknam said in a text message to the Morning Sentinel that the online threat is being investigated. “Yes we take this seriously,” he said. “We are currently investigating this threat. At this time there does not seem to be any credible evidence as to the threat. He has done similar things out in Florida, if you Google his name. “The police department and school are taking appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the kids in MSAD 54. Investigation ongoing. I have added an additional officer at the school. If at any point we need to elevate school posture we will.” Bucknam later in the day on Monday posted to the Skowhegan Police Department’s Facebook page that the department “takes all threats to our children very seriously and we are diligently investigating this threat. Although we do not have any credible information leading us to believe this is true we are still taking precautions. “Additional officers have been added to assist School Resource Officer (SRO) David Daigneault and we are in close communications with Superintendent Brent Colbry. If you have any information which may assist us in our investigation please contact SRO David Daigneault at 207-474-6386 or message us on the Skowhegan Facebook page.” Doug Harlow — 612-2367 [email protected] Twitter:@Doug_Harlow Success.

74,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/04/texas-seven-joseph-garcia-set-to-be-executed,"Garcia was sentenced to death under the ‘law of parties’, which his lawyers argue is unconstitutional Last modified on Tue 4 Dec 2018 11.12 GMT The horror of the crime is not in doubt: a notorious gang of heavily-armed prison escapees shot a police officer 11 times and ran over his body. What is questionable is the fate of Joseph Garcia, who is set to be put to death in Texas on Tuesday even though he insists he did not fire a shot.  If the 47-year-old’s last-ditch appeals fail, his death will add to an uptick in the number of Texas executions in a year in which Donald Trump repeatedly threw his weight behind a form of punishment that has declined in the US in recent years. Garcia argues he did not kill or intend to kill Aubrey Hawkins and prosecutors were unable to prove the identities of the shooters. Still, he was sentenced to die under Texas’s “law of parties”, which in some situations enables people to be held responsible for murders they did not personally commit. Garcia has launched a flurry of appeals, including claims of ineffective counsel and questioning the quality of the state’s lethal injection drugs. BuzzFeed News reported that the Texas prison system, which shrouds the sources of its drugs in secrecy, has bought supplies from a pharmacy with a disturbing safety record. His legal team hopes the US supreme court will decide that the law of parties, which is unusually broad in Texas, violates the ban on cruel and unusual punishments in the eighth amendment to the US constitution. The supreme court affirmed in 1987 that defendants can be put to death even if they did not kill or intend to kill, but Garcia contends that public and legal opinion has since evolved towards a narrower view of when the death penalty should be applied; capital punishment for juveniles, for example, was banned in 2005. “At this point there is a consensus against the death penalty in circumstances such as those in this case,” said Mridula Raman, Garcia’s lead counsel. “You’re punishing someone with death for a crime that they neither themselves committed nor intended to commit so how is that serving a deterrent value?… [The country is] supposed to reserve the death penalty for only the worst of the worst.” Trump, though, has named two highly conservative justices to the US supreme court, shifting its ideological balance to the right. “I think some of the justices are too new to the supreme court for us to have a good sense of where they may come out on some of these issues,” Raman said. Trump’s stance has long been clear. He took out full-page advertisements in New York newspapers in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the “Central Park Five”, black and Latino teenagers who were accused of assaulting and raping a jogger but exonerated years later. As a politician he has repeatedly backed capital punishment for crimes such as terrorism and the killing of police officers. After the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October he said that “we have to bring back the death penalty” (which, in fact, is still on the books federally and in 31 states). In March, addressing the opioids crisis, he called for the death penalty for drug dealers. Though there are 63 inmates on federal death row, the federal government has not conducted an execution since 2003. Meanwhile, Texas, by far the nation’s busiest death-penalty state, has executed 267 inmates since the start of 2003. While far below its modern-era high of 40 executions in 2000, Texas has seen a rise in judicial killings – from seven per year in 2016 and 2017 to 11 so far this year, with Garcia and Alvin Braziel Jr scheduled to die this month. That is more than half of the current national total: single executions have also been carried out in Florida, Ohio, South Dakota and Nebraska, with two each in Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. Texas’s figure is likely a result of fewer successful appeals this year than last, said Kristin Houlé, executive director of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. “The actual number of execution dates that have been scheduled has not increased over the last couple of years. What has changed though is the number of stays of execution granted by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals,” she said. Houlé doubts that presidential rhetoric will spark a capital punishment renaissance at state level. “I actually think we see quite the opposite. The decisions to pursue the death penalty and to use it are made at the county level by elected district attorneys in Texas and like the rest of the country we’ve seen the election of reform-oriented prosecutors in Texas,” she said. “I think that we will continue to see a decline in the number of death sentences imposed.” Garcia took part in one of the biggest prison breaks in Texas history. Seven men serving long sentences for violent offences escaped from a maximum-security unit near San Antonio in December 2000. They robbed a sporting goods store near Dallas on Christmas Eve, stealing 44 firearms. Hawkins, 29, responded to the incident and was killed in a gunfight. Garcia was originally serving a 50-year sentence for stabbing a man to death, an act he claimed was self-defence. If his appeals fail he will be the fourth of the “Texas Seven” to be executed; two remain on death row. Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, filed a brief to the supreme court on Monday opposing a stay of execution, arguing that the court’s 1987 decision should remain valid and the officer was an “entirely foreseeable” victim.",2018-12-04 06:00:38,'Texas Seven' Joseph Garcia set to be executed under controversial law,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

12.4.2018 11:15 AM In the midterm elections, the Democratic Party gained control of New York's state Senate from the Republicans, thus giving the Dems unified control of the governor's mansion and state legislature. It also gives extra energy to a gun-control bill introduced on November 30 by state Sen. Kevin Parker, who represents Brooklyn for the Democratic and Working Families Parties. It's not quite as bad as a Black Mirror episode or reports out of China about using social media as a means of social control, but it's inching in that direction. (Side question: How did someone not start a social media platform called Panopticon?) The bill would mandate that ""prior to the delivery of any rifle or shotgun sold by a licensed dealer to any person, the purchaser shall consent to have his or her social media accounts and search history reviewed and investigated by the police authority of the locality where such sale is made."" The legislation says cops should check out three years of activity on Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram and includes three years of searches on Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Parker introduced the legislation after the mass shooting at a synagogue in Pennsylvania on October 27. Although a number of accounts have said permit seekers would have to fork over their actual passwords to law enforcement, Parker says he is agnostic on that question. Following the typical script of panic-driven legislating, Parker stresses the ""newness"" of social media: ""We're in a new age with new technology, and we need new rules,"" Parker said. ""So we need to begin a conversation about the way that we monitor social media and use that in the context of giving out dangerous weapons that can in fact hurt or kill people."" When asked whether his law threatened various constitutional limits on government power, he responded: ""Ask the families of the people who were murdered in Pittsburgh if they thought it would be too far to make sure that that murderer didn't get his hands on a dangerous weapon."" Of course, any such legislation will face any number of challenges on First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment grounds. There is also a nearly endless litany of common-sense complaints: Why is any of this necessary, especially to exercise a constitutional right? Why only Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram and three search engines (not to give him any ideas, but if I were Parker, I'd try figuring out how to corral DuckDuckGo, a search engine whose selling point is privacy, into the matter somehow). Does Parker understand that histories can be altered or deleted? At the state level, New York already has very restrictive gun laws, with all counties and municipalities adding relatively tougher conditions to the owning and carrying of handguns. Throughout the state, handguns and carry permits are done on a ""may issue"" basis rather than the less-restrictive ""shall issue"" standard (basically, in ""shall issue"" jurisdictions, the default setting is that an individual has a right to own whatever he wants unless his record indicates a problem; ""may issue"" rules give greater discretion to law enforcement to deny permits). Given the relative lack of regulation on long guns in New York, Parker's law might actually have a bigger effect on people buying rifles and shotguns than those seeking handguns. The good news is that the bill doesn't currently have a sponsor in the state assembly and thus has no chance of moving forward at the current moment. The bad news? It may well get a sponsor. More importantly, it represents that direction in which the country seems to be headed: toward a ""mother-may-I"" world, in which some authority must always be consulted with before we are able to get on with our lives. After decades of filling up prisons and criminalizing more and more parts of everyday life, we seem to be correcting course by pushing for criminal justice reform, an end to the war on drugs (or at least on weed), and getting rid of mandatory sentencing run amok. But in other ways—and I think Parker's proposed law speaks to this—some of us are trying mightily to control and regulate so many aspects of our lives, regardless of the efficacy of any particular restriction, or the violence it does to basic norms of individual freedom.

The libertarian moment fizzled out. Which of the Reason staff seeks to control every aspect of our lives? ASK THE PEOPLE WHO WERE VICTIMS IF THEY THOUGHT PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY WAS IMPORTANT. You didn’t get the memo? Everyone is a victim! I asked them . No answer. In that case you get to make up an answer for them. Poster child for Franklin’s thought on liberty vs. safety. The bill would mandate that “prior to the delivery of any rifle or shotgun sold by a licensed dealer to any person, the purchaser shall consent to have his or her social media accounts and search history reviewed and investigated by the police authority of the locality where such sale is made.” “I don’t own a computer or phone. Now sell me my goddam gun.” Wait… ‘rifle or shotgun’? Not even pistols? Aren’t pistols the mode of weapon favored by bad guys* in just about every scenario from muggings to mass shootings? So this proposed law wouldn’t even be that good at what it proposes to do?? *And as a kind of corollary, aren’t rifles and shotguns the mode of weapon favored by people with what the media deems to be ‘legitimate’ usage of weapons, i.e. hunting, target shooting, etc? Not to say that pistols can’t be used for hunting or target shooting… Or that the concept of ‘legitimate’ usage of weapons is necessary for the right to be exercised of course. Just that I always see the argument: ‘Guns have only one use: To KILL’, and it would seem to me that if you buy that argument, it’s more truthy for pistols than for rifles/shotguns. Ah well, I give up trying to understand this logic. Then they get you for felony fraud. “I don’t own a computer or phone. Now sell me my goddam gun.” First you have to go buy a computer of phone, get several social media accounts and post for three years. then reapply. Clearly, if you do not have social media accounts, you are a ‘lone wolf’ terrorist, or just plain anti-social. Either way, common sense says “no gun for you”. The wording of the law illustrates the problem. After clearing a federal background check, you must undergo a second investigation where the rules and standards are totally subjective. Like may issue gun licenses, police would simply reject everyone except the very wealthy and politically connnected who have control over their jobs and continued employment. Everyone would be denied. Search histories? And if I clear them routinely? Or use the library? These people are morons. What’s funny is the government already has them (or can easily reconstruct them from ISP logs). So it’s irrelevant if you clear your history or not. That they even are asking for them is testament to the fact that they shouldn’t be doing so. Meaning: they already have your histories but don’t want to use them for fear of being deemed intrusive or creepy and thus generating political will to remove that particular power. But it’s not intrusive or creepy if you submit them voluntarily. Not necessarily. These people are disingenuous by habit. Their STATED reasons for wanting a law are seldom their REAL reasons for wanting a law. In this case, I suspect that this is the entering wedge, and that the actual goal, some years down the road, is placing the same requirement on obtaining a drivers’ license. The Progressive Left’s goal is always, Always, ALWAYS increased surveillance of the common citizen, who they consider to be a dangerous fool. Clearing your search history doesn’t clear it *at the ISP level*. Of course, that gets muddled because everything coming out of your house is on in IP address – so your ‘how to kill my wife’ searches are mixed in with your wife’s ‘how to kill my husband’ searches and your kid’s ‘how to kill my parents’ searches. And that would include stuff on phones if they’re done through the home wifi network. And it gets more complicated if you routinely use the library (as pointed out) or force an IP address refresh. Google keeps records of your searches and your ISP knows every URL you connect to. Google, Facebook and Twitter track your online activity even when you’re not logged into your accounts. And Chrome is a Trojan horse created to gather as much data about you as possible. If you use the library’s computer, they can still track you if you log into any of your accounts. The Niskanen Center is hosting a shindig, and all the best people are invited. #RecoveringLibertarian #PassionateModerate Off-topic, obviously. “I come from the libertarian movement, whose errors & darker impulses certainly contributed to the rise of Trumpism,” tweets Brink Lindsey. Please laugh. nonsense statement. what ‘darker impulses’ come from a concept that favors individual liberty, free economic exchange, and living & letting live?? how does striving against most of what Mr. Trump stands for – cronyism, autocracy, protectionism, exploitation, misogyny – ‘contribute to the rise of Trumpism’?? “We’re in a new age with new technology, and we need new rules,” Parker said Parker is full of it. The “new age of technology” doesn’t enter into it. This type of process would have been possible before the internet age, it’s just that the cops would have had to interview everybody that the applicant talked to before he/she could be given the gun. Social media just makes it easier and cheap. “We’re in a new age with new technology, and we need new rules,” Parker said” translates as “We think we can get away with it now,” Parker said. And who determines what is a good social life? what ever happened to the right to privacy or does that only apply to abortions these days where far more have been murdered than by all gun murders in the U.S.. Soon they will want our social histories to vote as well Precisely. Which is why I favor reformulating the Second Amendment as follows; “The occasional horsewhipping, defenestration, or lynching of an offensive government stooge being necessary for the security of a free people, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” And who determines what is a good social life? Officer discretion. And this people are not subjective? This people can not fall prey to their own flaws? To their own jelousy? Couldn’t some of them be racist? Couldn’t some of them not understand dark humor? Dude your social media should not be ground for your right to defend against criminals who will always have a gun. Fuck youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu. And even if you are a full-on Nazi who thinks the Jews should all be shot, odds are you are never going to go out and murder a bunch of people. So between the first and second amendments, it’s still pretty clearly an unreasonable imposition. Unpleasant people with terrible beliefs have the right to have guns too. “Unpleasant people with terrible beliefs have the right to have guns too.” They intend to fix that too, preferably by eliminating the Second Amendment. Of course with their attitude, as Obama said, that the Constitution is a list of “don’ts” instead of things the government should do, they would be even happier getting rid of the Constitution completely. wow. don’t remember that quote – can you cite?? love to read in context. I was not aware that Mr. Obama was actually a competent Constitutional scholar (so many of his statements clearly indicate otherwise). damn right the Constitution is a list of don’ts directed at government. it was written that way, over the objections of those who thought it was a straitjacket that could prevent the government from doing “good things that needed to be done”. the potential for abuse of government power is nearly unlimited, and a straitjacket is our only protection. we can only afford to ALLOW the government to do those specific tasks that can achieve broad consensus, and only in the form narrowly limited to achieve that task. Maybe we can right the ship if we required people to submit their social media histories before being allowed to exercise their 1st amendment rights. I’m thinking primarily speech here, but I’d be willing to entertain religion and assembly too. What? That’s not the way it works, you say? But but but I can make all the same arguments that apply to restricting the 2nd amendment apply to restricting the 1st. And before you criticize, I also would be (sarcastically) in favor of forcing people to quarter troops unless they submit their SM history as well. Because politicians have proven very dangerous to the liberties of Americans, I think they should be required to submit their social media histories to the public before they are allowed on the ballot! I, for one, look forward to the day I’m required to have a Facebook and Twitter account, posting regularly. And woe unto he who posts something that is deemed to be wrongthink. Even years later. Shit, I meant woe unto he/she/it/nogender/everygender who posts something that is deemed to be wrongthink. And I don’t mean ‘woe unto’ in a religious kind of way. Although neither do I mean it in an a-religious kind of way. But I also respect every religion. Even the corny ones. But I don’t mean ‘corny’ in a disrespectful way. Nor do I mean it in a respectful kind of way. Fuck. They’re not going to let me have any guns now. Or a woman. They will end up killing social media. If posting on social media means risking your career and social standing on the whims of the SJW trash who inhabit it, people will just stop using it. “They will end up killing social media.” Eh. I mean, would that be a bad thing, necessarily? We could always just use that time to go back to concentrating on pooping. It would also basically put an end to SJWs because without Social Media they would be forced to actually (non-anonymously) confront people they disagree with in a public setting. Something not all of them have the stomach for. I don’t think it would be a bad thing at all. But it will be a bad thing to the social media companies. Yet, they continue to pursue a path that will lead to their demise. Doesn’t seem to be doing it any harm now. In fact, like 90% of the internet is for porn, 90% of social media is for virtue signalling. So if you’re not on Twitter tearing other people apart, you’re suspect and in danger of being torn apart yourself. If posting on social media means risking your career and social standing on the whims of the SJW trash who inhabit it, people will just stop using it. Seems like we are already half-way there. And it hasn’t worked yet. This is why I won’t use social media with my real name. I like not having much come up when you Google my name. All you get is work stuff and some paper I wrote in high school on some weirdo’s website about Francis Bacon. Not just wrongthink. You will be punished if you don’t praise the right ideas. Having a page full of cute cat photos is no defense. True, that. Virtue signaling is a valuable skill and should be taught in universities if it isn’t already. And if that person doesn’t use any social media and doesn’t use tracking search engines? Read Brians comment above soon it will be a requirement to have a social media account just like health insurance and you must check in everyday and post your most meaningless thoughts. better yet lets just put an observer into every home just like China is doing by posting a million observers in muslim homes Who needs observers when telescreens are so much more efficient? If you like your social media account, you can keep your social media account. better yet lets just put an observer into every home I see commercials for them every day. Check out the Black Mirror episode “Nose Dive” “[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” —Fourteenth Amendment Since when has submitting one’s social media history to arbitrary scrutiny by the police been sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process? “Since when has submitting one’s social media history to arbitrary scrutiny by the police been sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process?” For purposes of civil asset forfeiture, filing charges against property is good enough to satisfy the due process requirements, according to the courts. If “United States vs. An Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes, More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls” is good enough, then this proposal will be super good enough. Clacker Balls is my porno name. I mean, now it is. Because they’re wrong about civil asset forfeiture, doesn’t make them right about this. Jeez, the depths we’ve gone to for the drug war. Black Mirror episode or reports out of China about using social media as a means of social control, but it’s inching in that direction. I’m not sure if I’d call it “inching” in that direction, but ok. Fortunately, I can’t imagine a bill like this actually passing and if it did, it seems a court would be quick to strike it down for multiple infringements into personal liberty. Madison was initially against enumerating individual rights as a Bill of Rights since he assumed that any rights which weren’t enumerated would be consumed. Jefferson argued that it was important to demark clear barriers where the government wasn’t allowed to infringe. At this point it feels like Jefferson was right. The government is trying to destroy even the rights we have explicitly listed and the only barrier stopping it is the explicit words stating the government isn’t allowed to do that. I understand Madison’s concerns but Jefferson was clearly correct here, just another example of the old saw, “get it in writing”. Unfortunately in the modern era the “clear barriers” have been honored more in the breach than the observance. “So we need to begin a conversation When a politician says we need to “begin a conversation”, knuckle up. We need to have a conversation that consists of you shutting up and this clown telling you how it is going to be. More importantly, it represents that direction in which the country seems to be headed: toward a “mother-may-I” world, in which some authority must always be consulted with before we are able to get on with our lives. It’s already that way when it comes to the economy. Want to do something that creates value for society, and generates a profit in the process? Get ready to start asking permission and obeying orders. It’s only a matter of time before it’s like that in our personal lives as well. If it was just social media, I’m good since I only have LinkedIn. The only way I have a shot with the search history is if they don’t know about incognito viewing (which they may not). Kevin Parker should be prosecuted for attempted mass identity theft and fraud for even proposing this. People should call Kevin Parker an Uncle Tom. Gun control is mainly a racist method used to keep black people from having guns. And just like all other gun control laws, this one will grow in scope. They’ll demand that gun owners submit to social media monitoring going forward, and all emails and texts as well. Why not force-initiating politicians? Have they got something to hide? Nothing from Reason so far concerning yesterday’s victory for the First Amendment out of the 9th Circuit. Wasn’t even mentioned in the morning links. Maybe Reason’s coming around to the ACLU’s way of seeing things. What case was that? https://www.yaf.org/news/yaf-wins-landmark-free -speech-lawsuit-uc-berkeley-to-pay-70000-and- rescind-unconstitutional-policies/ So far, complete silence here on an important First Amendment decision. The real Berkeley Free Speech Movement. Good for YAF. Back in the 80s, when the existence of the LP was a closely guarded secret. Some looters came into a UT YAF meeting and flung a hard plastic pudding package into a speaker’s face as he extolled the benefits of nuclear power plants. So the initiation of force to silence non-communist campus speakers has been going on at least 40 years now. Thanks Alci… And the no-border-inspections 9th Circuit, no less. This is news! 2nd Amendment: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. The genius of the 2nd Amendment protection of the People to keep and bear Arms is that it does not matter what new technology comes along. Its all protected from government infringement. Laser rifles of the future will also be as protected as swords, grenades, bombs, knives, pistols…. Reassuring, until you read the text of the Kristallnacht and Enabling Act laws passed in Germany. The Wikipedia has the German and English of that Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the Reich. Bear in mind that this was not long after the Reichstag Fire Act, which is a teeny-weeny bit like “our” Patriot Act scribbled in haste after Saudi religious berserkers flew planes into NY buildings. Germany at that time was about 98% Catholic and Protestant, much like Tea Partisans, Prohibition Party members,. American Party supporters and God’s Own Proselytizers. So tell me again It Can’t Happen Here… Of course it can happen here. That is why we keep guns. Wrong think again it is called the goverment,It is a huge dildo up your ass going state by state deciding arbitrarility how far your “rights” go. You are not allowed to own a bomb or genades since rhey are not common use weapons. I just love moronic statements like this one. “Ask the families of the people who were murdered in Pittsburgh if they thought it would be too far to make sure that that murderer didn’t get his hands on a dangerous weapon.” *facepalm* A modest suggestion: Let the looters lead by example and publish THEIR social media data for the past three years on all those platforms to show us how unthreatening it is. Indeed, since legislators have whack jobs with guns at their beck and call to run out on coercive missions as SWAT teams and cigarette hunters, politicians and their piggies First Responders? should be the first to reassure citizens of their own peaceful intentions. All of those politicos are absolutely committed to the initiation of force to accomplish their goals, exactly like kingfish and kingpins. Most of the “black lives matter” signature complains are far more complicated than they make them out to be. I saw a video the other day of a black guy going case by case explaining how this cases were not neccesarily racism even if they might have been in some cases. It’s a good thing his proposed law doesn’t mention woodchippers. ‘Give us your social media account’? 1. Are these things so ubiquitous that you can reasonably expect someone to have one and that its current? I mean, I have a Facebook and Twitter account (and, technically, Google Hangout? Whatever its called – they’re shutting it down anyway) but I haven’t even logged in to the Facebook account for at least a year now, maybe two. Similar with Twitter. 2. Does this guy explain how non-activity would be viewed? You can’t have a gun unless you have a at least 15 pieces of flair – but 15 is just the bare minimum and you need to guess how many would satisfy?3 2. And what about SnapChat or WhatsApp? Do those count as social media? 3. Wouldn’t you just create dummy accounts? Especially criminals and terrorists? At least the ones that can plan ahead? I can just see the results now: Read about school shooters – might be planning one – denied. Didn’t read about school shooters – obviously, he’s hiding something – denied. Not enough posts/friends – too much of a loner – denied. Posted a comment on Reason.com – Holy Christ, we’ve got to keep this free thinking, pro-independence maniac from owning a plastic butter knife! What will happen with this is it won’t be only the nutjobs who post rambling stuff about government conspiracies or Jews who will be denied gun permits by the benevolent State of New York. Anyone who posts photos of their kids or grandkids will be denied too, because the children might get access to guns. As will anyone who is recently divorced because maybe they want to take out their ex, or widowed, because maybe they are suicidal. Of course, anyone who complains about their job or school will be flagged too. Anyone black because of racist cops,anyone white because of racist cops,anyone skinny because of resentful fat bitches,anyone fat because of resentful skinny bitches…etc up to the infinite. Yeha i want to add more subjective requirements made by flawed people with low paying jobs. Yeha i want my own personal defense to be at the hands of someone who could totally discriminate against me for making too much or too little money or a million other posibilitys. These people don’t even fucking think before they act. They have no values .They don’t have the morals of second thinking the ramifications of this things. This guy should be executed for the amorality it is that someone with that position of power would present such and insane law. The bill would mandate that “prior to the delivery of any rifle or shotgun sold by a licensed dealer to any person, the purchaser shall consent to have his or her social media accounts and search history reviewed and investigated by the police authority of the locality where such sale is made.” Cool, now let’s apply the same requirement on anyone seeking an abortion. False equivalence – nobody’s using an abortion to kill….oh, wait. I completely agree that NYers should have the government pry into their private lives in order to buy a gun. They deserve to reap what they sow. I essentially started three weeks past and that i makes $385 benefit $135 to $a hundred and fifty consistently simply by working at the internet from domestic. I made ina long term! “a great deal obliged to you for giving American explicit this remarkable opportunity to earn more money from domestic. This in addition coins has adjusted my lifestyles in such quite a few manners by which, supply you!”. go to this website online domestic media tech tab for extra element thank you . http://www.Mesalary.com have his or her social media accounts and search history reviewed and investigated by the police authority Any guesses on how long that review will take? I suspect that there will be one person assigned, preferably one with a chronic illness requiring frequent doctor visits. The primary problem with this law is it imposes the exact opposite of what the 2nd amendment protects. If you must pass some arbitrary “test” to exercise your right to own a firearm for self defense then it is not a right, but a privilege p. i saw this idiot on Tucker Carlson last night and he was unable to ask a simple question- what justifies singling out gun owners for special investigation by compelling them to give up their passwords for social media? When Carlson asked why not just make everyone give up their passwords, the politician just stammered. The intent of this bill is very clear. Give police and politicians the ability to deny anyone from owning a gun. It isa defacto ban. This proposal only proves the first inclination of government is the restricting, not expanding of individual rights. This type of “law” is exactly why we have a Bill of Rights. The Founding Fathers by studying history knew any government over time will become oppressive under the guise of “social welfare” and “for the good of the people” since it has happened again and again. There always have been and always will be those who they know what is besf for everyone and will use whatever means necessary, including force to impose their will. This is just another great example. Please log in to post comments Elizabeth Nolan Brown

77,https://dailycaller.com/2018/12/04/stanford-frat-american-flag-offensive/,"SANDY HUFFAKER/AFP/Getty Images Stanford University fraternity Sigma Chi had a unique response to an administration official who said their American flag was “offensive, intimidating, aggressive or alienating.” After receiving said criticism, the fraternity decided to hang a much bigger flag outside their house. The story emerged from student newspaper “The Stanford Review,” which detailed an administration official — called “Mr. Z” in the report — advising a troubled fraternity last year on how to comply better with university policies.

Ron Helus at The Calvary Community Church for memorial service in his honor on November 15, 2018 in Westlake Village, California. Sgt. Helus was killed in a mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California on November 7. (Barbara Davidson/Getty Images) According to the report, the Stanford admin official asked the fraternity to remove a large American flag flying outside their frat building because the symbol may offend other students and faculty. Sigma Chi was told by an unnamed administration official that their flag made others “uncomfortable” and “tainted Sigma Chi’s reputation.” The report reads: The flag made others uncomfortable but that it’s being flown tainted Sigma Chi’s reputation and, presumably, worsened its chance of survival … The American flag, as a symbol, could be intimidating, aggressive or alienating — Mr. Z’s tone further signaled to [a student involved] that he found the mere sight of the American flag to be offensive. It continues: In protest of Mr. Z’s suggestion, the house declined to remove the flag, instead choosing to replace it with an even bigger one. Some members, of course, abstained from the discussion about and decision to purchase a bigger flag. The following day, by [the student’s] doing, Sigma Chi upgraded from a three-by-five-foot flag to a four-by-six-foot flag. The former flag was then framed and placed on display inside the house. This decision was, in Lozano’s words, a “silent but visible protest” against the classification of the American flag as a potentially stigmatizing symbol by a member of the Stanford administration.

SANDY HUFFAKER/AFP/Getty Images (RELATED: Here’s A Look Back At George H.W. Bush’s Life In Pictures) The report went on to detail how Sigma Chi’ was eventually banned from campus after the protest for other infractions against the Greek community and campus rules. The report ended with this potent line by opinion author Antigone Xenopoulos: “Next time you hear someone degrade a symbol of the United States — whether in the form of a flag, the Constitution, or the national anthem — you can defend the principles of this nation through oration or just go out and, like Sigma Chi, buy a bigger one.” ",2018-12-04 15:22:15,"Stanford Frat Told Their American Flag Was &#8216;Offensive&#8217; By Admin, Hangs Much Bigger Flag",,18775,http://dailycaller.com

Landry College Prep, a small Louisiana school that gained national fame for sending black students to some of the nation’s most prestigious universities, has a website that says it all — the complete sales pitch for parents and college admissions officers. The school promises to promote “each child’s self worth and dignity in a supportive, educational and safe environment…. T.M. Landry’s goal is that every child not only gets into, but gets THROUGH college.” But, as a New York Times investigation found last week, based on interviews with 46 people, the Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, school’s founders may also be perpetrating a well-orchestrated scam, an educational fraud befitting our times. The Times found that the school had doctored and even invented backgrounds for its students designed to appeal to Ivy League admissions officers looking for inspirational stories, while also abusing and manipulating students. Michael and Tracey Landry, the husband-and-wife team who opened the school, delivered a “slick sales pitch” in which they played on racial stereotypes in two ways, said Camille Zubrinsky Charles, a professor of sociology, Africana studies and education at the University of Pennsylvania who researches college admissions. First, the Landrys drew black and low-income parents by using the legitimate concerns many have about the quality of their local schools and the way that a poor education can lock children out of opportunity. Then, they distorted and invented stories of deprivation about those children for their college applications that were lapped up by colleges and an American public eager for evidence that hard work and so-called old-fashioned discipline are all that’s needed to “make it” in America. That myth also took in parents, who wanted to give their children the best chance of success, the Times reported. In reality, Landry Prep appears to operate with few teachers, relying on optional attendance, student-led learning, physical and emotional abuse and elaborately arranged scenes of academic achievement to paint a picture of a high-functioning, if unorthodox, school, the Times reported. “It’s clear,” Charles said, “that what was happening at the Landry school embodies a whole lot of things about education in America that just make you want to take a shower.” When confronted with the allegations, Michael Landry denied altering students’ transcripts and inventing stories about them but admitted that he physically punished students, the Times reported. Many of Landry Prep’s students come from Breaux Bridge and nearby Lafayette, Louisiana, and it’s not hard to see why parents jumped at what the school seemed to offer. In Breaux Bridge, just 15 percent of the town’s 8,323 residents has a college degree, half the national average, Census data shows. About 22 percent live in poverty, nearly twice the national figure. Lafayette is larger, home to a university and a more educated population, with a lower poverty rate of 5 percent. Both towns have a racial gap in high school graduation rates. In Lafayette, the graduation rate was 81 percent for white students and 68 percent for black students in the 2015-16 school year, the most recent for which data is available. That year in the parish of St. Martin (the Louisiana equivalent of a county), which includes Breaux Bridge, the graduation rate was 86 percent for white students and 75 to 79 percent for black students. (The National Center for Education Statistics releases ranges when student counts are so small that a specific number might reveal information about individual students.) This is not simply a local problem. Nationally, low-income black and Latino children are significantly more likely than white students to be assigned to public schools with the least qualified teachers, the lowest-quality facilities, fewer books and a less rigorous curriculum, a U.S. Department of Education study found this year. As a result of that pattern and disproportionate poverty, they also tend to not score as high as whites on standardized exams. College admissions officers often enter the field for the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of students who have been trapped by this inequality, said David Hawkins, executive director for educational content and policy at the National Association for College Admission Counseling, a group of about 15,000 people who work on the high school-to-college transition. “Most admissions officers understand very well the education divide in this country,” Hawkins said. “Then you take that Horatio Alger thing that got you into the field and then the recognition that many students have a tremendously hard time even getting to the point of application and yes, many admissions officers are keen to identify those students, those stories, and create those bridges to opportunity.” That’s exactly what Michael Landry appears to have been counting on, said Charles, the sociology professor. “He seems to have coerced and staged a play that he knew would work for his audiences,” said Charles, who learned of the issues at T.M. Landry through the Times investigation. “That it did says something, just not the things that I think bigots who may want to read into this situation will leap to.” With Harvard and other colleges and universities under fire or facing litigation over their efforts to admit a diverse student body, Charles said the Landry story produced the same feeling she gets in the first moments after news of a mass shooting breaks. There’s dual concern about the injured and dead as well as how all people of color will be described, or treated with added suspicion, if the person responsible is not white. With affirmative action in place, students of color remain vastly underrepresented on prestigious campuses, Charles said. But public comments about the Landry Prep situation have already come to feature a heavy dose of input from those who regard it as proof students of color can’t keep up at highly selective colleges and affirmative action programs represent an organized form of admissions rigging, giving too many slots away to people of color. One major flaw in that logic is that all of the colleges that admitted T.M. Landry students can argue they did not lower their standards to do so. Their admissions decisions were based on doctored but stellar transcripts. While the allegations against Landry Prep are egregious, there are parallels in the claims of many charter and private schools. Many tell parents that they have identified the elusive no-excuses yet loving environment that will eliminate years of educational disadvantage, said Will Stancil, a researcher at the University of Minnesota who focuses on civil rights in education. Many of those claims are false or overblown. Education quality and increased segregation are persistent issues at many charter schools. And unregulated and unaccredited private schools like Landry Prep maintain conditions that are, by design, unknown and unmonitored. Landry Prep receives no federal or state funding, which means the Louisiana Department of Education has no oversight. “We see a lot of outrageous claims that aren’t backed up by data from these experimental schools,” Stancil said, “a lot of fear tactics aimed at parents who know their kids really are disadvantaged. Then, for those parents and the general public, there are these videos out of places like Landry of these highly improbable, against-all-odds, really emotional success stories."" “One exploits legitimate fears,” Stancil continued, “and the other distracts people, makes them believe that a quick fix is possible and that they don’t need to demand and focus on systemic change.” Janell Ross is a former reporter for NBC BLK. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2018-12-04 11:37:00,"What the T.M.

80,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/12/house-democrats-gun-control-background-checks/,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Mike Thompson address gun violence during a February news conference.Tom Williams/Congressional Quarterly/Newscom/ZUMA House Democrats plan to prioritize a bill that will require a background check for every gun sale, according to multiple sources close to the matter. The legislation represents an aggressive shift in strategy by Democrats and their gun reform allies, who in previous years had tended to pursue more modest background check bills that would have exempted large numbers of gun purchases. Federal law currently only requires licensed firearm retailers, such as gun stores or hunting shops, to run the would-be buyer through the FBI’s National Instant Background Check System. This means any firearms purchased outside those venues—on the internet or from a private dealer at a gun show, for instance—can be sold without taking that step. According to a 2017 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine, which was funded in part by supporters of gun control, 22 percent of US gun owners obtained a firearm without a background check over the past two years. Attempts to strengthen background checks have languished at the federal level since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left 26 dead. In the wake of the massacre, the Senate failed to pass a bipartisan measure sponsored by Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) that would have partially closed the private gun sale loophole but would not have required background checks when family and friends wanted to sell firearms to one another. Though Manchin proclaimed at the time that “if you’re a law-abiding gun owner, you’ll love this bill,” an intense lobbying campaign by the National Rifle Association destroyed its prospects. Since then, legislation that echoes the Manchin-Toomey provisions has languished in the GOP-controlled Congress. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) and Peter King (R-N.Y.) have reintroduced the measure twice in the last four years, but House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) refused to bring the bill up for a vote—even as it racked up 208 co-sponsors, including 14 Republicans. But with Ryan leaving Congress and Democrats winning control of the House, Thompson now plans to introduce a bill that will go further than any of those earlier proposals: It will require a background check for every gun sale or transfer, regardless of who’s doing the selling or transferring. The move has been in the works since before the election, when Thompson met with outside gun reform allies like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Everytown for Gun Safety, the Center for American Progress, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and Giffords to talk about what they might push for if Democrats won the House. To take such a hard line with no track record of legislative success could be a risky move, but gun control advocates point to the 2018 midterms as proof the political calculus on guns has shifted. A record 97 percent of people polled voiced support for universal background checks in the wake of the February shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and many Democratic congressional candidates successfully flipped red seats while running on platforms calling for stricter gun regulations. Earlier this week, 46 incoming House Democrats wrote a letter to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the likely speaker, calling for gun reform to be among the first priorities Democrats address in January. Thompson also expects the background check bill to have some Republican support when he introduces it in the next session; indeed, King’s office confirmed to Mother Jones that he plans to sign onto the bill. “The American people are on our side,” says Robin Lloyd, director of government affairs at Giffords, which was founded by former Arizona congresswoman and mass shooting survivor Gabby Giffords. “We’ll get strong universal background checks out of the House, and we believe it’s going to be bipartisan.” The precise details of the legislation have not been finalized; Thompson is still discussing the bill with his fellow Democrats and plans to release more specifics sometime before the end of the year. Pelosi’s office told Mother Jones it could not confirm details about when the bill would be introduced in the next session, but its emergence makes good on a promise Pelosi made to the student survivors of the Parkland shooting—with whom she regularly discusses gun reform priorities—about passing universal background checks if Democrats regained control of the House. And while the bill will almost certainly pass the House, there’s little evidence to suggest Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will bring it up for a vote or that President Donald Trump would be willing to sign it. But success in the House would be a signal to voters of Democrats’ commitment to the issue. A House vote would also put Republicans on the record on the matter—something that hasn’t happened during eight years of GOP control.

4 Famed New Orleans district attorney’s information on the JFK murder may finally become public thanks to award-winning journalist and documentary producer. By Donald Jeffries John Barbour, the Emmy award-winning journalist and show business veteran, has announced his intention to release long-suppressed files from the investigation conducted by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. The renegade district attorney drew the ire of the entire establishment with his investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which began in 1967 and inspired Oliver Stone’s award-winning 1991 film “JFK.” Barbour was granted the only interview Garrison gave after losing the Clay Shaw trial and would produce the documentaries “The Garrison Tapes” and the recent, groundbreaking “The American Media and the 2nd Assassination of President John F. Kennedy.” When Harry Connick took over as district attorney in New Orleans, he ordered a police officer to destroy all of Garrison’s files. That officer felt the records were historically important and had them copied. Geno Munari, owner and proprietor of Houdini’s Magic Shop in Las Vegas, found the Garrison files for sale on eBay and bought them. After viewing Barbour’s new film on the media and the JFK assassination, he was so moved that he sent him $500. He followed that up by giving him the massive treasure trove of Garrison files—67 boxes in all.  Barbour was drawn in by the very first file he read, which was David Ferrie’s admission that he was affiliated with the CIA. Barbour actually mentioned another one of these files in his film, which dealt with a 1967 CIA memorandum to its legal staff instructing them to render all possible aid to Shaw, the man Garrison was prosecuting. Garrison was attacked relentlessly in the mainstream media, with a furor that was unmatched until the election of President Donald Trump. This included Johnny Carson dropping any pretense of impartiality during Garrison’s appearance on “The Tonight Show” and an NBC special that was so overtly biased the network was forced to grant the embattled district attorney air time to respond. Garrison was left to try Shaw alone, after all his most important witnesses either died unnaturally or were protected by governors of other states (including California’s Ronald Reagan and, ironically, Texas’s John Connally), who denied Garrison’s extradition orders. Garrison attempted to charge Shaw with perjury immediately after the trial, but a typically biased judge issued an injunction forbidding the district attorney and his office from further prosecution of him. Barbour told this reporter that he felt a historical responsibility to release such important information to the public. “Jim Garrison chose me, quite by accident, to give his only interview in all the years following the Shaw trial,” Barbour said. “I was honored to be his Boswell, and to tell his whole story to the American people.” Barbour said he was pleasantly surprised by all the attention he garnered from a recent appearance on the popular “SGT Report” podcast, inspiring him to share the files. Garrison had explained to Barbour that, while the Warren Commission files were sealed for 50 years following the release of the long-discredited Warren Report, his own files weren’t scheduled for release until 20 years after that. Barbour had a long career in the entertainment field, as a screenwriter for various 1960s television shows, as a standup comic, and as creator and co-host of the number one show “Real People.” He has been called the “godfather of reality television.” Barbour also was Frank Sinatra’s personal writer, until their relationship ended over Barbour’s support for beleaguered “coroner to the stars” Thomas Noguchi, whose findings had contradicted the official conclusions in the assassination of JFK’s brother, Robert F. Kennedy. Barbour’s interest in the assassination was initially piqued when he read Garrison’s first book on the subject, Heritage of Stone, and he later attempted unsuccessfully to chronicle the actual story of his investigation on “Real People.” Barbour plans a gradual release of the files, beginning with all the information Garrison compiled on Shaw. While it is unlikely there is a “smoking gun” in Garrison’s files, Barbour’s announcement comes at a time when Trump has waffled back and forth on releasing the remaining classified government documents relating to the Kennedy assassination. Initially, Trump boasted about making all the files public but in April of this year was pressured by the intelligence agencies to withhold some of them until the year 2021. “The continued withholdings are necessary to protect against identifiable harm to national security, law enforcement, or foreign affairs that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure,” Trump declared. Trump did not explain just what “national security” concerns there could be, if the government’s long discredited theory that JFK was killed solely by minimum-wage loser Lee Harvey Oswald without any help from anyone connected to “national security,” is correct. Donald Jeffries is a highly respected author and researcher whose work on the JFK, RFK and MLK assassinations and other high crimes of the Deep State has been read by millions of people across the world. Jeffries is also the author of two books currently being sold by the AFP Online Store.  Lets hope they are real and not phonies designed to mislead like those other files “renegade” Trump put out.

83,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/4NW_4MTd6AA/,"House Democrats plan to introduce legislation criminalizing private gun sales once the new Congress is in session. Mother Jones reports that Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) met with gun control groups that included the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Everytown for Gun Safety, the Center for American Progress, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and Gabby Giffords’ group. He asked them what they wanted, and a bill to criminalize private gun sales was on their wish list. So Thompson will sponsor legislation requiring a background check before someone may buy a gun from his neighbor, a co-worker to get a background check before buying a gun from a co-worker, and so forth. The bill will go so far as to require a son to get a background check before a father can give him a gun as a gift. Private gun sales are legal and have been an American tradition since 1791, the year the Second Amendment was ratified. Ironically, a ban on private sales would not have stopped a single mass shooting witnessed to this point in the 21st century because nearly every mass shooter acquires his guns at retail via a background check. The exceptions to the rule are the mass shooters who steal their guns. While the Democrats’ gun control push will not prevent mass shootings, it will criminalize a grandfather for passing his goose gun to his grandson without government permission. It will also criminalize a mother who gives her college-age daughter a revolver for self-defense without first getting government permission.

86,https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/vox-lux-movie-review-760289/,"Welcome, The star gives a take-no-prisoners performance as chart-topping musician formed (and scarred) by tragedy Film Critic Natalie Portman and Raffey Cassidy in 'Vox Lux.' Atsushi Nishijima/Neon Brady Corbet’s knockout of a second feature (following 2015’s The Childhood of a Leader, about the growing pains of a fascist tyrant) damn near explodes off the screen. Yes, a movie about the traumatic childhood that formed a formidable pop diva might be too much for some people. But this actor-turned-director doesn’t use Vox Lux to show off … though there is admittedly a little of that. And you should prepared to be wowed by Natalie Portman, who delivers a take-no-prisoners performance as Celeste, a swaggering rock diva who tends to burn down everything in her path, especially when she’s crossed. Often on the verge of a nuclear meltdown, fueled by alcohol and drugs, Celeste never leans on anyone; she’s all she needs, with any leftover glimmers of vulnerability banished from her brand. Hair slicked back, her face slathered in glitter to hide the creeping darkness, this singer-songwriter is a tiny time-bomb of talent and ruthless need. You speculate about how this fame monster lost her innocence — how her star ever got born. Related Reviews

						Meet the Beatle: A Guide to Ringo Starr's Solo Career in 20 Songs Which is why Vox Lux begins with our antiheroine’s wonder years. Willem Dafoe is the narrator who introduces us to the 13-year-old Celeste, played by the remarkable Raffey Cassidy (The Killing of a Sacred Deer): “In the beginning, she was kind and full of grace,” he says of this shy, Staten Island schoolgirl. Out of the blue, she finds herself badly injured during a Columbine-like school shooting, a tragic common-occurrence staple of the new century. The incident inspires her to write a musical lament — and the song, cowritten with her older sister Eleanor (Stacy Martin), surprisingly catapults her into the celebrity sphere virtually overnight. Suddenly, Celeste is being commodified by a manager (Jude Law, sleaze personified) and sold to the highest bidder. From L.A. video shoots to recording studios in Stockholm, the teenager is shoved into a world for which nothing has prepared her, especially a pregnancy that results from a one-night stand with an older Brit rocker. Corbet and the gifted cinematographer Lol Crawley bring tremendous energy and momentum to the scenes of a young woman’s rise in a broken pop universe — she’s Madonna, Britney and Katy rolled into one confused pop princess. In a smash cut to the present, we meet Portman’s now-adult Celeste; in a nice touch, Cassidy plays the singer’s estranged, teen daughter Albertine. This hardened, jaded chanteuse exaggerates everything from her New Yawk accent to her diva demands, yet she’s still taken aback when she learns that the terrorists behind a mass shooting in Croatia were wearing masks copied from one of her best-known videos. At an ambush of a press conference, Celeste vainly tries to swat away the intrusive questions about her music being a spark to violence. The stage is the only place she has left to belong. At the hometown, stadium concert that ends the film with the star singing rousing, electro-pop anthems (written by the “Chandelier” powerhouse Sia), Celeste carves out a safe harbor in the blinding glare of the spotlight. Striding on stage in dance routines choreographed by Portman’s husband Benjamin Millepied, this woman refuses to bear the burden of the film’s title to be a voice of light. “I don’t want people to think, I just want them to feel good,” she says. But can they? Can Celeste? Can we? Corbet asks those questions with undeniable verve and feeling. That’s what makes Vox Lux such a dynamite provocation. The film creates a universe where fame crowds out humanity. You can’t stop thinking about it. In This Article:

Dan + Shay Dan + Shay enjoyed a victory lap on Tuesday’s episode of Good Morning America, performing their romantic hit “Speechless” while the song sits at Number One on Billboard‘s Hot Country Songs chart for a second week. On the GMA stage, “Speechless” is a showcase for Shay Mooney’s athletic vocals, diving and twisting around in dramatic fashion every time they arrive at a chorus. Dan Smyers provides some low-end vocal support, adding a sturdy foundation for Mooney’s sky-high leads amid the piano-driven groove. The second single from their self-titled third album, “Speechless” is only the third song of 2018 to reach Number One on the multi-metric chart, with the Florida Georgia Line and Bebe Rexha collaboration “Meant to Be” dominating for 50 consecutive weeks until Kane Brown’s “Lose It” finally unseated it in November. But the singles from Dan Smyers and Shay Mooney’s third albums have been streaming and airplay giants thus far, with their previous hit “Tequila” coming it at Number Three on Billboard‘s year-end Hot Country Songs chart.  Dan + Shay recently held a benefit concert in Smyers’ hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to raise funds for the Tree of Life Synagogue, where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting in October. The sold-out event raised $60,000 through ticket sales, merchandise and donations. Next up, the duo will head to the U.K. for a brief run of shows in January, with plans to launch “Dan + Shay The Tour” in late February. In This Article:

Spielberg's Academy Award-winning film about the Holocaust, ""Schindler's List,"" is returning to select theaters this week in honor of its 25th anniversary. It's a story that still resonates today, he said in an interview with ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt airing Wednesday. ""I think there is more at stake today than even back then,"" Spielberg said, referring to when the film was released. ""When collective hate organizes and gets industrialized, then genocide follows,"" said Spielberg. ""We have to take it more seriously today than I think we have had to take it in a generation,"" he said during a time of heightened identity politics and the massacre of 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in which the suspected shooter left a trail of anti-Semitic posts online. ""Schindler's List,"" released in 1993, tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman whose efforts to employ Jews during the Holocaust saved 1,200 people. Although he made some of the most popular and enduring blockbusters in history — from ""E.T."" to ""Jurassic Park"" to ""Jaws"" — it was ""Schindler's List"" that earned Spielberg his first Academy Award. But he never imagined it would also earn commercial success. ""I couldn't imagine based on the story that we told that an audience would tolerate just the amount of violence, human against human. Or inhuman against human,"" Spielberg, 71, said. ""No one thought the film was going to make any money."" But it did, and then some — snagging $320 million worldwide. Ultimately, it was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including best director and best picture, and is widely considered to be one of the most important films of all time. Spielberg shot the film in Poland, where the real Schindler first brought on Jews to run his factory, saving them from death camps. The film pulled no punches, bound to the history of brutality, fear and inhumanity. One such scene depicts a group of women who are led to the showers at Auschwitz, afraid that they will be gassed. ""No one acted that day,"" Spielberg said. ""There was kind of a virtual panic that really happened in that very dark space."" The film took a personal toll on both Spielberg and the cast. ""I think everybody felt that we were memorializing something,"" Spielberg said. ""I've only had this experience twice, one was shooting 'Schindler's List,' and the second time, it was very reverential, was shooting 'Lincoln.' The two times that I think the entire company came together to pay their respects."" ""Schindler's List,"" which clocks in at over three hours, was shot in black and white — a decision Spielberg said the studio was against. ""I don't know the Holocaust in color. I wasn't around then,"" he said. ""But I've seen documentaries on the Holocaust. They're all shot in black and white. That's my only reference point. I wanted it to feel real."" Real — not just for the audience — but for the survivors Spielberg had met along the way. ""God bless the one Schindler survivor that came over to me,"" Spielberg told Holt. ""She said, 'I want to tell you my story.' And I said, 'Well, I'm telling your story.' She said: 'Oh, that's nothing. That was a tiny part of my life. I want to tell you my entire story of what my life was like, who I am. I want you to see me.'"" That conversation was the seed that planted what would become USC Shoah Foundation. Founded by Spielberg in 1994, the institute videotapes and preserves interviews with survivors of the Holocaust and other genocides. The collection now contains testimony from more than 55,000 survivors and witnesses. Testimony that otherwise would have become ""lost history,"" Spielberg said. For a man who is no stranger to ""best-of"" lists, Spielberg still ranks ""Schindler’s List"" as one of the most personal films he has ever made. ""I don't think I'll ever do anything as important,"" he said, adding, ""So this, for me, is something that I will always be proudest of."" ""Schindler’s List"" was produced by Universal Pictures, which is owned by NBC News' parent company, NBCUniversal.

90,https://www.thedailybeast.com/alabama-mall-shooting-shows-again-that-theres-no-second-amendment-for-black-men?source=articles&via=rss,"SEARCH Somehow when the good guy with a gun is black, like EJ Bradford, police all too often perceive a threat—and respond to it with deadly force. Contributing Editor They shot him in the back. According to an independent forensic examination commissioned by the family of Emantic “EJ” Bradford, Jr., the 21-year-old was shot three times from behind—in the head, neck and back. And then, they lied. They said the former Army private had been involved in a Thanksgiving night shooting at a suburban Birmingham mall. They said he was the same man who got into a fight on the second floor and was suspected of firing the shots that wounded an 18-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl. Just before 10 p.m., “one man pulled a gun and shot the other twice in the torso” near the entrance of Foot Action, a popular sneaker store, reported a local ABC station, citing an account offered by the Hoover police department.” First, police claimed that a responding officer shot and killed EJ, the man they said was responsible for the bloodshed, within seconds of the shooting. They said EJ, who was armed, was running away from the scene when Hoover, Ala. officers encountered him. They portrayed their officers as heroes who acted quickly to “take out the threat,” according to the Montgomery Advertiser. But a day later, law enforcement officials revealed that a second gun had been found in the mall and they were forced to admit that EJ was not the shooter. His gun was cold and had never been fired that night. They remained convinced, they said in a press conference, that the former soldier  was still somehow involved in the incident. ABC pasted a note atop the previous day’s story: “UPDATE (11/24): According to a release from the Hoover Police Department, new evidence suggests that EJ Fitzgerald Bradford, who was shot and killed by officers, may have been involved in the original altercation, but he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old.” That was also a lie. (The police will say now that they were responding to information as it came in, but when that information always ends up putting the person the police shot in the worst possible light, the word “lie” applies.) Witnesses say the two undercover officers never identified themselves, nor did they give any orders to anyone, before one of them fired the fatal shots. Though he was licensed to carry, witnesses say EJ never produced his weapon. He never threatened anyone. Yet, Hoover police released a statement the following Monday saying EJ “had a gun in his hand” and that “Mr. Bradford brandished a gun.” Brandish, Webster’s Second tells me, means “To shake or wave (a weapon), usually menacingly.” Witnesses who contacted the family’s attorney dispute that account and believe mall surveillance and police body camera video will prove the weapon was found still attached to his pants. Undisputed is the fact that, despite EJ carrying identification, Hoover police did not notify his family for hours and left  his body in public view for some of that time. His parents  did not receive confirmation of their son’s death until his father, a former corrections officer battling cancer, contacted a Hoover police detective around 5 a.m. Friday morning. EJ, they were told, had shot two people at the Riverchase Galleria mall before he was killed by officers on the scene. Yet, according to witnesses, EJ did everything right. He was trying to help other shoppers get away. He was a law-abiding citizen who had a concealed carry permit and, thus, the legal right to have a gun in his possession at the mall. Within days, after the official story had unraveled and protesters took to the streets, Alabama state law enforcement tracked down the man they now say was the real shooter. Why was EJ Bradford shot? A police officer “saw a black man with a gun and he made his determination he must be a criminal,” the family attorney—who previously represented the families of  shooting victims Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown—said in a press conference. I am a gun owner and have been for the better part of my adult life. I gave up carrying a few years ago, in the wake of a high-profile mass shooting. Recently, however, I made the decision to purchase a new gun when I became concerned about my personal security. While my family’s safety was the deciding factor, I am mindful of the inherent risks that come with being black and owning a gun. By the time I am seen as “a good guy” it may well be too late. State and federal firearms laws will do little to protect me from an officer who sees me a threat and the statistics say a jury will almost certainly agree, if things even get that far. For us, the Second Amendment all too often does not apply. In mid-November, a suburban Chicago police officer killed a black security guard who was attempting to detain someone involved in a fight at a bar. Jemel Roberson, who had a gun, was wearing gear that plainly identified him as a guard. “Everybody was screaming out, ‘Security!’,” witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV. Responding officers ignored them. We know that 12-year-old Tamir Rice will never come home again. A Cleveland police officer shot him in a public park where he had been seen playing with a toy gun. Given no time to respond to commands (if any were made at all), Tamir was shot within seconds of the officer exiting his squad car by a cop who had been previously ruled unfit for duty by a neighboring police department. We know that the Second Amendment did not protect Philando Castile, who was shot by an officer in Minnesota, even though he told the officer that there was a gun in the car. Officer Jeronimo Yanez said he had “no choice.” Castile was killed as he reached for his identification. A jury acquitted Yanez of manslaughter. Then there was John Crawford III, who picked up a toy gun in an Ohio Walmart. He had threatened no one. There was no inciting incident. “Police said Crawford, who was 22, didn't obey commands to drop what they learned later was an air rifle he was carrying from a store shelf,” according to NBC News, despite video showing Crawford was shot immediately when officers entered the aisle. No one was ever charged in his killing. After the Alabama shooting, the National Rifle Association—a group that pays and publicly touts several prominent black spokespersons—said what it does after nearly every incident involving police shooting a black man with a legal weapon: nothing. Writing in The Atlantic, Adam Serwer named it The Rice Rule: There are no circumstances in which the responsibility for a police shooting of an unarmed black person cannot be placed on the victim. The same applies, of course, to an armed black person. “I did not want to see pictures of my son laying in a pool of blood and when I accidentally came across it I broke down,” said Bradford’s mother, April Pipkins, who stumbled across the horrific image as it circulated online and who has said that she believes she son would still be alive if he had been white. “And I can’t get it out of my head. I cannot get the scene out of my head of my child laying there, nobody around him trying to help him, just laying like a piece of trash where everyone can walk around and parade and post pictures of him on social media.” Hoover city officials—including the mayor and police chief—apologized to the family in a private meeting the following Tuesday. They offered their sympathies and said they were sorry for publicly misidentifying EJ as the shooter, but not for shooting him. After all, he was carrying a gun. Because he had a gun, they said, EJ was “heightening” the threat and thus culpable in his own death—after they shot him three times in the back.",2018-12-05 20:57:28,"Alabama Mall Shooting Shows, Again, That There's No Second Amendment for Black Men",,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

92,https://www.dailynews.com/2018/12/05/cal-state-northridge-condemns-hate-message-threatening-a-shooting/,"Trending: Cal State Northridge is on heightened alert after an apparent threat of a mass shooting and a swastika were found scrawled on the walls of Sierra Hall. The message, discovered Wednesday, read: “Mass shooting in Sierra Hall 12/12/18” and pictured a swastika below. Other racist and hateful messages – including “Die N****** & Jews” and another swastika – have been reported in recent days in the cluster of buildings known as the Sierra complex, university officials said. CSUN police Chief Anne Glavin did not say how many such messages there were. But she did say they involved “several buildings” and that most were scrawled in men’s bathrooms. “From everything that we and our law-enforcement partners have looked at about this, there is no credible threat,” Glavin said. “It does not mean we are done investigating. We are not.” The department is working with several other law enforcement agencies while investigating the messages. The chief noted that the mass shooting threat for Dec. 12 coincides with final exams week. She said it’s “always possible” that could have been a motivating factor. Meanwhile, the campus is stepping up visible patrols and has added officers from other California State University campuses. No person of interest had been identified, the chief said. However, she added, police have received tips. CSUN President Dianne F. Harrison said classes will remain in session and finals “will continue as planned.” She urged those who are particularly affected by the threat and hate-filled language to speak to their instructors or supervisor about any requests for academic or work adjustments. “Additionally, CSUN will be evaluating what accommodations may be needed for students as they head into finals,” she said in a statement. “We will closely watch the situation and communicate with students and employees should we need to make changes relating to finals and the status of campus.” David Katz, executive director of Hillel 818, a 58-year-old Jewish student group on campus, said it has been in “close coordination” with the university to ensure a safe, warm and comforting environment for all students. “While our students are upset and concerned, we’re really looking to provide them with the support they need during this troubling time,” Katz said. The center has close ties with the Jewish Federation’s Community Security Initiative and the Los Angeles Police Department, he added. “CSUN is one of the warmest and most welcoming campuses to Jewish students and to students from all backgrounds,” Katz said. “While issues like this have come up at other campuses, it really hasn’t been an issue here in a very long time.” Meanwhile, campus assaults on Nov. 27 and 28 against female students have also attracted headlines. Peter Wei, 26, of Northridge was charged with two felony counts of assault to commit a felony, including rape, sodomy or oral copulation and one misdemeanor count each of battery and resisting, delaying or obstructing an officer, according to Los Angeles County prosecutors.

These efforts reveal how much saying #MeToo can cost you. By
      
        Jessica Testa Posted on December 6, 2018, at 6:22 a.m. ET In a sign of #MeToo’s influence in 2018, crowdfunding giant GoFundMe announced Thursday that a legal defense fund for victims of workplace sexual misconduct raised more money than any other campaign this year — making it the biggest fundraiser in the history of the platform. The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund has brought in more than $22 million since its launch in December 2017. Last year’s top campaign, which raised money for victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting, amassed just over half that: $11.7 million. Moreover, the Hollywood-backed campaign came close to matching what all of the top 10 campaigns of 2017 combined earned (about $23.5 million). And while nearly $30 million was raised on GoFundMe this year for California fires relief, those donations were spread across several campaigns; Time’s Up is the largest single fundraiser. As the Time’s Up fund thrived in 2018, victims of sexual misconduct in desperate financial situations took notice. A search for “rape” on the platform yields about 4,000 campaigns, while “sexual harassment” turns up nearly 500. Some of these pages date back years; some were created this week. Some campaigns are run by do-gooders, like marathon runners and youth organizations looking to support local victims charities, or artists working on zines and stage productions devoted to survivors. But many fundraisers have been created by the victims themselves, or in their names by loved ones. Most famously, a campaign for Christine Blasey Ford launched in September, about a week before she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, asking for help covering her family’s security, transportation, and temporary relocation expenses. The goal was $150,000, but Ford raised $647,610 before ending the campaign in November. “Because of your support, I feel hopeful that our lives will return to normal,” she wrote to nearly 14,000 donors. Any leftover funds would be donated to organizations that help trauma survivors, she added. “Throughout the year, we saw people respond to the news and come together to stand up for women’s rights and fight sexual harassment and violence against women,” GoFundMe CEO Rob Solomon said in a statement. “From friends supporting each other in local communities to women on the national stage, such as Dr. Ford, we saw people engage, find community, and turn compassion into action.” But the remarkable prosperity of Ford’s and Time’s Up’s campaigns is not the norm. Crowdfunding can only go so far, and sometimes it doesn’t go anywhere at all. Scores of campaigns for sexual assault victims have raised $0, or received a handful of donations but then dried up, meeting less than 10% of their goals. This can be devastating for the people behind the fundraisers, particularly when the stakes are so high — a matter of life or debt. Christine Blasey Ford testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27. Lesser-known GoFundMe campaigns offer an incomparable glimpse into the private aftermath of sexual assault: An Ohio campaign sought funds for a woman’s second-trimester abortion after her rapist impregnated her; a woman pleaded for help paying her phone bill, explaining she’d been out of work since being diagnosed with PTSD following her rape; another asked for $300 to replace her bedding “to remove the emotional stain” of her attack. Dozens more sought help paying medical or therapy bills. And many victims, looking for the same kind of relief Time’s Up promised, have asked for thousands or tens of thousands to help pay legal bills incurred while either suing abusers or defending themselves against lawsuits. For three years, singer-songwriter Katie Armiger has been in an on-and-off legal battle with her former record label, Cold River Records, stemming largely from her allegations that she was groped and harassed by country music industry professionals when she was as young as 15. Early on, Armiger learned that even though her lawyers had taken on her case pro bono, she was still responsible for a variety of legal fees and court costs. When her first case settled in 2016, for example, she had to pay a mediator a few thousand dollars — her total earnings from touring that year. Last November, Armiger, 27, decided she wanted to take her case to trial once and for all, and she knew that would cost her. So she launched a GoFundMe with a $20,000 goal for legal expenses. A year later, she’s raised about $9,000 from 200 donors. This spring, Armiger was relieved to hear that Time’s Up would begin sponsoring her legal fight. She’s studying sociology at a Nashville community college while trying, in spurts, to make music again. Without crowdfunding — her own or Time’s Up’s — she said she’d be “living in fear, every day,” figuring out how to afford these legal costs on top of her living expenses and student loans. Katie Armiger in 2014. “That's why a lot of these cases don’t go to trial,” Armiger said. “Even if your attorneys are kind enough to donate their time, there's still a lot of money you have to pay on top of that. People don’t have it.” This fall, Alex McCall, a 50-year-old contractor for a federal agency in Colorado, struggled to find an attorney. In August, she’d reported to her supervisors and authorities that a colleague sexually assaulted her while they were on a break at work, she said. While her allegations were being investigated, she learned the accused coworker had apparently hired a criminal defense lawyer. She thought she should have an attorney too. McCall first contacted the National Women’s Law Center, which administers the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund. The organization gave her a list of Denver-area lawyers who might be able to help. She called a few but couldn’t get an appointment. She ended up hiring an attorney recommended by a friend. He charged $2,000 for a retainer, which McCall said she didn’t have. Her GoFundMe, created in mid-October to help cover the retainer, had raised $965 at publication time. McCall paid for the rest, sending her “personal finance situation into turmoil,” she said. As she waited for months to hear anything from her bosses or the district attorney’s office on the fate of her alleged assailant, she began feeling like she was “going broke fighting what looks like a lost cause.” “I'm out of gas. I don’t know that I have much left for this fight,” McCall continued. “I feel a lot of regrets that I ever said a word.” When crowdfunding is successful, the money can become a symbol of community solidarity and reassurance, even validation. “When it’s not successful,” explained another GoFundMe campaigner, Monica Morrison, “we can feel abandoned and isolated.” In April, when a friend offered to set up a GoFundMe for her, Morrison was grateful but nervous about how people might react. The 33-year-old writer from Queens, New York, was trying to raise $5,000 to hire a First Amendment attorney to protect her from being silenced by the man she accused of sexual assault. “People seem to think rape victims are opportunistic,” Morrison said, “like they’re trying to get a cash settlement. When really, there are so many untold costs of victimization that never get paid for.” In January, partially inspired by the #MeToo movement, Morrison decided to contact the employer of the man she said assaulted her at a Dartmouth College fraternity party in 2005. She’d seen on LinkedIn that he had a high-powered job that involved working with colleges. Concerned, she said, she notified his HR department that he’d sexually assaulted her when she was in college. When the man then threatened a slander lawsuit and tried to get her to sign a promise to never talk about the alleged assault again — or face a $500,000 penalty — Morrison said she knew she needed an attorney. Her GoFundMe has fallen thousands of dollars short, though. Within the campaign’s first month, Morrison raised nearly $3,000 from 50 donors, all of which went to her lawyer’s retainer, she said; she paid the remaining $2,000 out of pocket. Her costs only increased when she and her attorney decided to seek a declaratory judgment against her alleged abuser. Essentially, they wanted a judge to assert that Morrison’s efforts to talk about what had happened were protected under free speech laws and that any slander claims or demands she sign nondisclosure agreements were baseless. They filed the complaint on Nov. 1. By then Morrison’s bill had risen to $15,000, a wrecking ball aimed at her savings. In response, she tripled her GoFundMe goal, but donations have only trickled in over the past few months. Morrison said she’s a “novice in the world of crowdfunding,” held back by not knowing how to successfully market a campaign, but also by her concern over public perception. Being both a victim of sexual violence and a woman asking for money, she feels stigma on top of stigma. “I can see the comments now. ... Why did she file if she couldn’t afford it?” Morrison said. “I've had people not support me and tell me it's a waste of money, that it's not worth it, that I should just keep my money and keep my mouth shut.” But Morrison never thought this would be an expensive legal fight, she said. In the beginning, she even hoped she could get Time’s Up funding, though she was eventually denied because her alleged assault didn’t take place at work. Today, as steadfast as she is about the righteousness of her cause — securing the freedom to tell her story without fear of retribution — she knows it’s likely that even more financial turbulence and stress lie ahead. “What is daunting for me is the looming prospect of ongoing litigation, which could be exponentially expensive,” she said. “But this is the hill I’m willing to die on. I’m not going to be silent any longer.” ●   Jessica Testa is a national reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York. Contact Jessica Testa at jessica.testa@buzzfeed.com.

94,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/06/democrats-renew-calls-for-stronger-gun-control,"Democratic majority in the House expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales Last modified on Wed 26 Feb 2020 17.57 GMT Prominent Democrats plan on Thursday to begin ramping up calls for stronger gun control at the start of a new push to use their strengthened voice in Washington to make progress on an issue that bitterly divides America. US senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, where 20 children and six school staff were gunned down at Sandy Hook elementary school in December 2012, will lead demands for fresh action.  And the newly empowered Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is expected to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as one of the first priorities in the incoming Congress of 2019, in an aggressive new strategy according to a report this week in Mother Jones. On Thursday Murphy and Blumenthal will be joined on Capitol Hill by a number of House Democrats and a clutch of leading anti-gun violence advocacy groups, shooting survivors and the bereaved, calling for change. The event will follow the annual national vigil for all victims of gun violence at St Mark’s episcopal church just off Pennsylvania Avenue, close to the Capitol. Family members of victims from mass shootings in the high school at Parkland, Florida, earlier this year, the Las Vegas massacre at a country music concert last year, and other recent mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, Charleston, South Carolina, and Houston, Texas. Last month 12 people were shot dead in a country music bar in Thousand Oaks, California, just before the area was hit by the worst wildfires in state history. One victim had narrowly escaped the Las Vegas shooting, and his family angrily demanded gun control. The issue has stalled in Washington, with negligible progress from the White House or Congress, despite pledges from Donald Trump that there would be definitive action to curb gun violence after the shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018, which sparked a new youth movement against gun violence. Last week the father of one of the young children who died in the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, on 14 December 2012, near Newtown, Connecticut, filed another lawsuit against conspiracy theorists who claim he is an actor and the massacre was a hoax. Lenny Pozner, whose six-year-old son Noah was killed, is suing James Fetzer and Mike Palacek, who co-wrote a book, Nobody Died at Sandy Hook. Pozner has had to move house several times to attempt to escape persistent harassment from a variety of conspiracy theorists, stating via an attorney that he has even feared for his life. Federal law requiring background checks is limited and often not well enforced. Even some bipartisan efforts to strengthen background checks via legislation have failed to get anywhere in the Republican controlled Congress. The GOP still controls the Senate after the midterm elections, so bills passed by the newly Democratic majority House can be blocked. But Democrats are feeling emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy on gun control, in the hopes of winning more Republican support and also setting out their stall ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Earlier this week, 46 incoming House Democrats wrote a letter to Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to regain the speaker’s gavel in January, demanding that gun reform be a top priority for the incoming Congress. The New York Republican congressman Peter King has previously supported bipartisan legislation to tighten background checks, even though the bill languished in the GOP Congress, but has indicated he will support fresh legislation along similar lines. The California Democratic congressman Mike Thompson is expected to introduce a bill. Thompson will join Murphy, Blumenthal and Connecticut congresswoman Elizabeth Esty on Thursday at the call to action on Capitol Hill, as well as advocacy groups including the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Newtown Action Alliance and Giffords, the campaign group started by former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords after she survived a mass shooting at one of her local political events in Tucson in January, 2012.",2018-12-06 08:41:07,Newly empowered Democrats ramp up calls for stronger gun control,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

(Getty Images) Famed director Steven Spielberg recently said that audiences could gain more out of watching his 1993 holocaust movie “Schindler's List” today more than any other time thanks to the current political climate. He sat down with NBC News’ Lester Holt to discuss the upcoming re-release of the film to commemorate its 25th anniversary. In the interview, Spielberg was asked about its relevance following what Holt described as a rise in anti-semitism in America in the wake of a mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. “I think this is maybe the most important time to re-release this film,” Spielberg says in the video below. “Possibly now is even a more important time to re-releases Schindler’s list than 1993-94 when it was initially released. I think there’s more at stake today than even back then.” He was later asked what he hoped a modern audience could learn from sitting down to watch the movie, which chronicles the real-life story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved 1,200 Jewish people during the Holocaust by employing them in his factory. “Individual hate is a terrible thing, but when collective hate organizes and gets industrialized, then genocide follows.” Regardless of its modern relevance, “Schindler’s List” was a decided hit when it was released, eventually earning 12 Academy Awards and scoring roughly $320 million worldwide. At the time, however, Spielberg wasn’t sure that the movie would be well-received, let alone a hit. ""I couldn't imagine based on the story that we told that an audience would tolerate just the amount of violence, human against human. Or inhuman against human,"" the 71-year-old director said. ""No one thought the film was going to make any money."" This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2021 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

98,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/sviFs0Oq5Qk/,"Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard doubled down Wednesday on his push to criminalize private gun sales, particularly those occurring at gun shows and flea markets. Hubbard says in an Instagram video that background checks are not legally required in private gun sales, like those that occur between family members or at gun shows or flea markets. Not only does Hubbard’s gun control push here sound identical to the Democrats’ talking points from the last 30 years, it is exactly what the Democrats are pushing now. On December 5, 2018, Breitbart News reported that incoming House Democrats plan to push a universal background checks bill that will criminalize private gun sales. As with Hubbard’s gun control push, the move will not stop a single mass shooting; it will, however, criminalize a mother who gives her college-age daughter a revolver for self-defense without first getting the federal government’s permission. Hubbard did not point to a single 21st century mass shooting that was carried out with a privately purchased gun, and that is because nearly every one of the shooters got their guns at retail via a background check. The exceptions are the shooters who stole their guns.
Democrats have been using gun shows as an excuse to try to criminalize private gun sales since the 1990s, and Hubbard is parroting their flawed gun control mantra by:  One more video from my heart to help clear up any confusion I may have caused with the hope to help us become unified as American citizens. I love you all regardless of religious or political views or where you stand on gun laws, but let’s start having good conversations out of love that help us all reach one goal: a free, safe, educated and loving place we all call home.

House Democrats hold first committee hearing on Capitol riot Metro By Tina Moore and Natalie Musumeci Submit December 6, 2018 | 3:05pm				| Updated December 6, 2018 | 5:46pm A Jewish Queens city councilwoman was sent a hate-filled, anti-Semitic letter that makes a reference to the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, she told The Post on Thursday. Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz (D-Forest Hills) opened the typed, more-than-a-page-long letter at her district office last Thursday and was disturbed by the contents. “It has very vulgar language. I was very offended by it and taken aback, especially now with everything that’s going on,” Koslowitz said Thursday. The letter, filled with grammatical errors, was dated Nov. 12 and mailed to 250 Broadway in Manhattan, where the City Council has hearings and officers. It begins “Dear Karen.” “You had been defending all stinky, filthy, dirty jewish population in New York City as well as the stinks mof’s living in Israel, russia, former soviet union countries, in western European and Latin American countries,” the letter states. A handwritten sentence included at the end of the letter refers to October’s mass shooting inside a Pittsburgh synagogue. “What do you think about those stinky Jews killed, 11 and 4 hurt in that synagogue,” the sentence reads. “What these motherf—–r rats are doing in other states of the USA???” Another portion of the letter states: “I do not know why AL QAEDA PATRIOTS; THE ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS AND ISIS LEADERS had been unable to finish the work that was started in concentration camps in Poland and finished with these race of crooks, in israel, russia and most important here in the U.S.” Koslowitz told The Post “this person who wrote this letter, he attacked me personally.” The lawmaker — who says her grandfather was killed in Poland in 1923 because of his Jewish heritage, causing her family to flee to New York — added: “Since I am Jewish I feel he targeted me.” “My grandfather in 1923 was killed because he was Jewish. They came to his house and they took him out and they killed him only because he was Jewish,” Koslowitz said. “That night, my grandmother, my mother and everyone else in the family, they fled Poland and came to New York. I grew up with the story.” The letter was signed “Yours, Joe Camillieri” of Forest Hills, and the return address is steps away from Koslowitz’s office. “I also feel that obviously he comes to the meetings,” Koslowitz said. “He knows what I talk about. I’ve been a supporter of the Bukharian Jewish community…He’s talking about meetings that I go to…It’s scary.” The longtime councilwoman notified the NYPD of the letter she received on Wednesday and says she was told by police that it is “not a hate crime.” An NYPD spokesman told The Post: “The letter is vile, disgusting and reprehensible, but the investigation has been thorough and a crime has not been committed at this time. We will continue to monitor it.” Koslowitz said she disagrees about the letter not being considered a hate crime. “I’m Jewish. To me, it’s offending Jewish people,” she said. “It’s against Jews for sure.” “I really feel the laws have to be changed for what they consider a hate crime,” she said, adding, “Someone to take the time to write a letter like this is really scary.” Read Next FDNY Chief James Leonard removed from post over allegation...

100,https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/06/rep-gohmert-slammed-over-anti-semitic-soros-slur/,"Trending: By Felicia Sonmez | Washington Post Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, is coming under criticism for falsely claiming in an interview that billionaire philanthropist George Soros, known for his funding of liberal and pro-democracy groups, “helped take the property” owned by fellow Jews. Patrick Gaspard, president of Soros’ Open Society Foundations, sent a letter to Gohmert on Thursday afternoon, asking him to apologize for the “disturbing and false anti-Semitic slur.” In an interview Thursday morning with Fox Business Network’s Stuart Varney, Gohmert spoke about Google’s plans to build a censored search engine in China. At one point in the interview, Gohmert pivoted from discussing the tech giant to making accusations against Soros, who is frequently the subject of conspiracy theories and in October was among the prominent critics of President Donald Trump to whom a Florida man allegedly mailed pipe bombs. “You mention Orwell. It also reminds me of another George – George Soros – you know, because Google is born in a free country, and then they go over and oppress others – help oppress – in another country,” Gohmert told Varney. “George Soros is supposed to be Jewish, but you wouldn’t know it from the damage he’s inflicted on Israel, and the fact that he turned on fellow Jews and helped take the property that they owned. It’s the same kind of thing.” George Orwell was a British author. Varney moved on without addressing Gohmert’s statements. He later distanced himself and the network from Gohmert’s views, the Daily Beast reported. “Congressman Louie Gohmert for some reason went out of his way to bring up George Soros and made unsubstantiated and false allegations against him. I want to make clear those views are not shared by me, this program or anyone at Fox Business,” Varney said. Gohmert on Thursday was referencing a false claim that Soros helped the Nazis confiscate property from Jews during World War II. Soros has said he used false papers to survive the Nazi occupation when he was 13 years old, living in Hungary. The allegation that he is a Nazi who turned in fellow Jews and stole their wealth is “a total fabrication,” Soros told The Washington Post earlier this year, saying such charges “annoy me greatly.” On Thursday afternoon, Gohmert doubled down on his remarks, which he argued were “not anti-Semitic” but rather “pro-Jewish.” “Soros himself admitted in a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft on December 20, 1998, that he had no regrets whatsoever about assisting the Nazis in confiscating property from the Jewish people during the Holocaust,” Gohmert said in a statement released by his office. “That is a fact.” Yet a transcript of the “60 Minutes” interview published by the fact-checking website Snopes shows that, after initially appearing to agree with Kroft that he “helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews,” Soros later clarified that he “was only a spectator.” “I had no role in taking away that property,” Soros said. “So I had no sense of guilt.” Gohmert also on Thursday cited a “statement that the Israeli government made last year that anti-Soros statements are not anti-Semitic.” But while the Israeli Foreign Ministry statement was sharply critical of Soros, it did not declare that all criticism of Soros was not anti-Semitic. Gaspard, the president of Soros’s Open Society Foundations, said in his letter to Gohmert on Thursday that “this conduct is beneath your office.” “Just to reiterate the facts: George Soros escaped the Nazis as a 14-year-old boy, and he has spent most of his life supporting efforts to ensure that such terrifying authoritarianism never takes root again,” Gaspard said. “He did not collaborate with the Nazis. He did not help round up people. He did not confiscate anybody’s property.” He added that it was “the height of irresponsibility” for Gohmert to make such remarks just weeks after the mass shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue and the pipe bomb targeting Soros. “You are not entitled to misrepresent his and his family’s courage during such a terrifying and difficult period in our history,” Gaspard said. Soros has been the subject of a range of unfounded conspiracy theories over the years, including one that he recently funded a caravan of Central American migrants making its way through Mexico toward the U.S. southern border. Trump suggested last month that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if Soros was funding the group. Some of those conspiracy theories have made their way into U.S. government-funded broadcasts. The head of a U.S. government agency apologized last month for the airing of a program that called Soros a “nonpracticing Jew of flexible morals,” claimed that he was involved in “clandestine operations that led to the dismantling of the Soviet Union” and described him as “the architect of the financial collapse of 2008.” The Spanish-language report was produced by Radio and Television Marti, which is aimed at audiences in Cuba. Gohmert has previously taken aim at Soros, telling host Fox Business host Lou Dobbs in October that it was “not anti-Semitic” to criticize the liberal megadonor.

101,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/12/06/rams-aaron-donald-and-bears-khalil-mack-have-stayed-close-from-first-round-to-big-money/,"Trending: THOUSAND OAKS – Two defensive player of the year awards, and $276 million in contract money. That’s what Aaron Donald and Khalil Mack have totaled since they last faced each other, as rookies. 
They’re almost like fraternal twins. Drafted eight spots apart in the 2014 first round, Donald and Mack have taken different paths to dominance, but they are considered two of their generation’s top pass-rushers, and they’ll meet Sunday when the Rams travel to Chicago in a game with great meaning for both teams. 
Sign up for Home Turf and get exclusive stories every SoCal sports fan must read, sent daily. Subscribe here.
Add another number: 105. That’s the combined number of career sacks for Donald and Mack. Listen closely, and it’s possible to hear groaning from quarterbacks Mitchell Trubisky and Jared Goff. 
“When you face those great rushers, it’s a challenge for you, but it’s one you look forward to,” Rams left tackle Andrew Whitworth said. “You’ve got to do your best to give us time to complete plays and move the football.” 	


Donald, with a league-high 16.5 sacks, is on his way to a second consecutive defensive player of the year award, and perhaps league MVP consideration. He’s an absolute force inside, and for decades to come, the story of the 2014 draft will be about the 12 teams that passed him up before the Rams grabbed him. 
Donald indicated Thursday that he and Mack aren’t close friends but that they’re cordial, and there’s clearly respect there. 
						
“He’s a heck of a football player,” Donald said. “He can do a lot of things. He’s a play maker and a big-time player.” 
Not every team made a big mistake in that draft, though. Oakland drafted Mack at No. 5 and didn’t regret it, at least until this past August, when Donald and Mack, tied together again, made league history. 
Both players’ rookie contracts were about to expire, and both teams insisted they weren’t waiting for the other player to sign. Oakland wasn’t waiting to see how much the Rams gave Donald, and vice versa. 	


Right. Sure thing. It just so happened, then, that the day after the Rams gave Donald a new six-year, $135-million contract, the Raiders – apparently unwilling to match that – traded Mack to Chicago. Mack then topped Donald by signing a six-year, $141-million deal, the biggest ever for a defensive player. 
Neither team has been disappointed. The Rams clinched the NFC West last week, and the Bears lead the NFC North and are on track for their first playoff appearance and division championship since 2010. 
Mack missed two games this season with an ankle injury but has nine sacks in 10 games. In last week’s overtime loss to the New York Giants, Mack had one sack and tied his season high with five tackles. 
“He plays with great urgency and juice every single play,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “He can really bend and turn on the edge, and then when he gets close to the quarterback, he is violently attacking the football.” 
Sacks aren’t great for an offense, but the Rams have a bigger issue. Mack has forced five fumbles this season, although he has only one in his last six games. Goff has lost three fumbles in his last two games, and while his pocket awareness is generally good, Goff seems prone to having the ball stripped. 
The Rams’ offensive line has received rightful praise this season for its consistency and strong play, but things haven’t been all rosy for this unit. The Rams have allowed the ninth-fewest sacks, but Goff has been dropped 26 times in 12 games this season, compared to his 25 sacks in 15 games in 2017. Now, the Rams face a Bears defense, led by Mack, that is strong up front.

“You definitely have a plan for it,” Goff said. “When a guy like (Mack) can affect the game, you have to be conscious of it through the week and have a plan for it. Yeah, be aware of where he is, but still play your game and focus on what you need to do.” 
Turnovers are important to the Bears. Their plus-12 margin is the best in the league, as is their total of 21 interceptions. Goff has turned over the ball four times in his last two games. 
So the Rams have some concerns, but so should the Bears, given that it’s been a couple months since another team proved capable of blocking Donald. He’s coming off one of the greatest efforts of his career, with two sacks and a game-turning forced fumble in the fourth quarter against the Lions. 
Donald, with 16.5 sacks and four games remaining, might even have an outside chance to break Michael Strahan’s single-season record of 22.5 set in 2001. 
“I’m just playing football,” Donald said. “If it happens, it happens. If it don’t, it don’t. I’m just doing my job and trying to fly around.” 
Now, Donald likely will face Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has missed the previous two games with a shoulder injury. The Bears have made no promises, but Trubisky appears to be on track to play against the Rams and Donald, who might not be great for Trubisky’s shoulder. 
Asked by Chicago reporters about avoiding re-injury, Trubisky said: “Being smart, trying to slide properly, trying not to be so unorthodox, picking up yardage and then just getting down when I need to get down. Getting out of bounds. And continue to stay aggressive. But like I said, I’m not going to go out there if I’m not 100 percent. I’m going to play my game. No reservations. Just go out there and do what I know how to do.” 
NO HESITATION
Rams cornerback Aqib Talib is expected to have a full workload this week, McVay said before Thursday’s practice at Cal Lutheran. Last week in Detroit, in his first game back after ankle surgery, Talib played only the first half (26 plays), and the Lions totaled three points and 87 passing yards. 
“He’s good,” McVay said. “We’ll hopefully not have to have him on any sort of pitch count at all this week. That was kind of the goal all along. It sounds like the field has been in good condition in Chicago, from what I understand. Unless something sets us back, he’s going to be a full go, from the start to the finish.”

Talib and the Rams will face a talented, balanced Chicago pass game and has split catches among receivers Taylor Gabriel (54) and Allen Robinson (41), tight end Trey Burton (38) and running back Tarik Cohen (a team-high 59). A return to full action by Talib at least will give the Rams two solid cornerbacks and perhaps some insurance for Marcus Peters, who has been nursing an ankle injury. 
“As long as he’s ready to go, we’re going to let him play,” defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said of Talib. 
BIG HONOR FOR WHITWORTH
The Rams selected left tackle Andrew Whitworth as their nominee for the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which annually recognizes a player “for outstanding community service activities off the field, as well as excellence on the field.” The winner will be announced the night before the Super Bowl. 
Whitworth has been involved in several charitable efforts since he joined the Rams in 2017. Most recently, he donated a game-week check to a fund for victims of last month’s mass shooting in Thousand Oaks. Whitworth also has contributed to causes involving the Make-A-Wish Foundation and military veterans.

Report an Error They’re almost like fraternal twins. Drafted eight spots apart in the 2014 first round, Donald and Mack have taken different paths to dominance, but they are considered two of their generation’s top pass-rushers, and they’ll meet Sunday when the Rams travel to Chicago in a game with great meaning for both teams.

Add another number: 105. That’s the combined number of career sacks for Donald and Mack. Listen closely, and it’s possible to hear groaning from quarterbacks Mitchell Trubisky and Jared Goff. 
“When you face those great rushers, it’s a challenge for you, but it’s one you look forward to,” Rams left tackle Andrew Whitworth said. “You’ve got to do your best to give us time to complete plays and move the football.” 	


Donald, with a league-high 16.5 sacks, is on his way to a second consecutive defensive player of the year award, and perhaps league MVP consideration. He’s an absolute force inside, and for decades to come, the story of the 2014 draft will be about the 12 teams that passed him up before the Rams grabbed him. 
Donald indicated Thursday that he and Mack aren’t close friends but that they’re cordial, and there’s clearly respect there. 
						
“He’s a heck of a football player,” Donald said. “He can do a lot of things. He’s a play maker and a big-time player.” 
Not every team made a big mistake in that draft, though. Oakland drafted Mack at No. 5 and didn’t regret it, at least until this past August, when Donald and Mack, tied together again, made league history. 
Both players’ rookie contracts were about to expire, and both teams insisted they weren’t waiting for the other player to sign. Oakland wasn’t waiting to see how much the Rams gave Donald, and vice versa. 	


Right. Sure thing. It just so happened, then, that the day after the Rams gave Donald a new six-year, $135-million contract, the Raiders – apparently unwilling to match that – traded Mack to Chicago. Mack then topped Donald by signing a six-year, $141-million deal, the biggest ever for a defensive player. 
Neither team has been disappointed. The Rams clinched the NFC West last week, and the Bears lead the NFC North and are on track for their first playoff appearance and division championship since 2010. 
Mack missed two games this season with an ankle injury but has nine sacks in 10 games. In last week’s overtime loss to the New York Giants, Mack had one sack and tied his season high with five tackles. 
“He plays with great urgency and juice every single play,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “He can really bend and turn on the edge, and then when he gets close to the quarterback, he is violently attacking the football.” 
Sacks aren’t great for an offense, but the Rams have a bigger issue. Mack has forced five fumbles this season, although he has only one in his last six games. Goff has lost three fumbles in his last two games, and while his pocket awareness is generally good, Goff seems prone to having the ball stripped. 
The Rams’ offensive line has received rightful praise this season for its consistency and strong play, but things haven’t been all rosy for this unit. The Rams have allowed the ninth-fewest sacks, but Goff has been dropped 26 times in 12 games this season, compared to his 25 sacks in 15 games in 2017. Now, the Rams face a Bears defense, led by Mack, that is strong up front.

“You definitely have a plan for it,” Goff said. “When a guy like (Mack) can affect the game, you have to be conscious of it through the week and have a plan for it. Yeah, be aware of where he is, but still play your game and focus on what you need to do.” 
Turnovers are important to the Bears. Their plus-12 margin is the best in the league, as is their total of 21 interceptions. Goff has turned over the ball four times in his last two games. 
So the Rams have some concerns, but so should the Bears, given that it’s been a couple months since another team proved capable of blocking Donald. He’s coming off one of the greatest efforts of his career, with two sacks and a game-turning forced fumble in the fourth quarter against the Lions. 
Donald, with 16.5 sacks and four games remaining, might even have an outside chance to break Michael Strahan’s single-season record of 22.5 set in 2001. 
“I’m just playing football,” Donald said. “If it happens, it happens. If it don’t, it don’t. I’m just doing my job and trying to fly around.” 
Now, Donald likely will face Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has missed the previous two games with a shoulder injury. The Bears have made no promises, but Trubisky appears to be on track to play against the Rams and Donald, who might not be great for Trubisky’s shoulder. 
Asked by Chicago reporters about avoiding re-injury, Trubisky said: “Being smart, trying to slide properly, trying not to be so unorthodox, picking up yardage and then just getting down when I need to get down. Getting out of bounds. And continue to stay aggressive. But like I said, I’m not going to go out there if I’m not 100 percent. I’m going to play my game. No reservations. Just go out there and do what I know how to do.”

Mack then topped Donald by signing a six-year, $141-million deal, the biggest ever for a defensive player. 
Neither team has been disappointed. The Rams clinched the NFC West last week, and the Bears lead the NFC North and are on track for their first playoff appearance and division championship since 2010. 
Mack missed two games this season with an ankle injury but has nine sacks in 10 games. In last week’s overtime loss to the New York Giants, Mack had one sack and tied his season high with five tackles. 
“He plays with great urgency and juice every single play,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “He can really bend and turn on the edge, and then when he gets close to the quarterback, he is violently attacking the football.” 
Sacks aren’t great for an offense, but the Rams have a bigger issue. Mack has forced five fumbles this season, although he has only one in his last six games. Goff has lost three fumbles in his last two games, and while his pocket awareness is generally good, Goff seems prone to having the ball stripped. 
The Rams’ offensive line has received rightful praise this season for its consistency and strong play, but things haven’t been all rosy for this unit. The Rams have allowed the ninth-fewest sacks, but Goff has been dropped 26 times in 12 games this season, compared to his 25 sacks in 15 games in 2017. Now, the Rams face a Bears defense, led by Mack, that is strong up front.

“You definitely have a plan for it,” Goff said. “When a guy like (Mack) can affect the game, you have to be conscious of it through the week and have a plan for it. Yeah, be aware of where he is, but still play your game and focus on what you need to do.” 
Turnovers are important to the Bears. Their plus-12 margin is the best in the league, as is their total of 21 interceptions. Goff has turned over the ball four times in his last two games. 
So the Rams have some concerns, but so should the Bears, given that it’s been a couple months since another team proved capable of blocking Donald. He’s coming off one of the greatest efforts of his career, with two sacks and a game-turning forced fumble in the fourth quarter against the Lions. 
Donald, with 16.5 sacks and four games remaining, might even have an outside chance to break Michael Strahan’s single-season record of 22.5 set in 2001. 
“I’m just playing football,” Donald said. “If it happens, it happens. If it don’t, it don’t. I’m just doing my job and trying to fly around.” 
Now, Donald likely will face Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has missed the previous two games with a shoulder injury. The Bears have made no promises, but Trubisky appears to be on track to play against the Rams and Donald, who might not be great for Trubisky’s shoulder. 
Asked by Chicago reporters about avoiding re-injury, Trubisky said: “Being smart, trying to slide properly, trying not to be so unorthodox, picking up yardage and then just getting down when I need to get down. Getting out of bounds. And continue to stay aggressive. But like I said, I’m not going to go out there if I’m not 100 percent. I’m going to play my game. No reservations. Just go out there and do what I know how to do.” 
NO HESITATION
Rams cornerback Aqib Talib is expected to have a full workload this week, McVay said before Thursday’s practice at Cal Lutheran. Last week in Detroit, in his first game back after ankle surgery, Talib played only the first half (26 plays), and the Lions totaled three points and 87 passing yards. 
“He’s good,” McVay said. “We’ll hopefully not have to have him on any sort of pitch count at all this week. That was kind of the goal all along. It sounds like the field has been in good condition in Chicago, from what I understand. Unless something sets us back, he’s going to be a full go, from the start to the finish.”

Talib and the Rams will face a talented, balanced Chicago pass game and has split catches among receivers Taylor Gabriel (54) and Allen Robinson (41), tight end Trey Burton (38) and running back Tarik Cohen (a team-high 59). A return to full action by Talib at least will give the Rams two solid cornerbacks and perhaps some insurance for Marcus Peters, who has been nursing an ankle injury. 
“As long as he’s ready to go, we’re going to let him play,” defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said of Talib. 
BIG HONOR FOR WHITWORTH
The Rams selected left tackle Andrew Whitworth as their nominee for the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which annually recognizes a player “for outstanding community service activities off the field, as well as excellence on the field.” The winner will be announced the night before the Super Bowl. 
Whitworth has been involved in several charitable efforts since he joined the Rams in 2017. Most recently, he donated a game-week check to a fund for victims of last month’s mass shooting in Thousand Oaks. Whitworth also has contributed to causes involving the Make-A-Wish Foundation and military veterans.

Report an Error “He’s a heck of a football player,” Donald said. “He can do a lot of things. He’s a play maker and a big-time player.” 
Not every team made a big mistake in that draft, though. Oakland drafted Mack at No. 5 and didn’t regret it, at least until this past August, when Donald and Mack, tied together again, made league history. 
Both players’ rookie contracts were about to expire, and both teams insisted they weren’t waiting for the other player to sign. Oakland wasn’t waiting to see how much the Rams gave Donald, and vice versa. 	


Right. Sure thing. It just so happened, then, that the day after the Rams gave Donald a new six-year, $135-million contract, the Raiders – apparently unwilling to match that – traded Mack to Chicago. Mack then topped Donald by signing a six-year, $141-million deal, the biggest ever for a defensive player. 
Neither team has been disappointed. The Rams clinched the NFC West last week, and the Bears lead the NFC North and are on track for their first playoff appearance and division championship since 2010. 
Mack missed two games this season with an ankle injury but has nine sacks in 10 games. In last week’s overtime loss to the New York Giants, Mack had one sack and tied his season high with five tackles. 
“He plays with great urgency and juice every single play,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “He can really bend and turn on the edge, and then when he gets close to the quarterback, he is violently attacking the football.” 
Sacks aren’t great for an offense, but the Rams have a bigger issue. Mack has forced five fumbles this season, although he has only one in his last six games.

Rams cornerback Aqib Talib is expected to have a full workload this week, McVay said before Thursday’s practice at Cal Lutheran. Last week in Detroit, in his first game back after ankle surgery, Talib played only the first half (26 plays), and the Lions totaled three points and 87 passing yards. 
“He’s good,” McVay said. “We’ll hopefully not have to have him on any sort of pitch count at all this week. That was kind of the goal all along. It sounds like the field has been in good condition in Chicago, from what I understand. Unless something sets us back, he’s going to be a full go, from the start to the finish.”

Talib and the Rams will face a talented, balanced Chicago pass game and has split catches among receivers Taylor Gabriel (54) and Allen Robinson (41), tight end Trey Burton (38) and running back Tarik Cohen (a team-high 59). A return to full action by Talib at least will give the Rams two solid cornerbacks and perhaps some insurance for Marcus Peters, who has been nursing an ankle injury. 
“As long as he’s ready to go, we’re going to let him play,” defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said of Talib. 
BIG HONOR FOR WHITWORTH
The Rams selected left tackle Andrew Whitworth as their nominee for the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which annually recognizes a player “for outstanding community service activities off the field, as well as excellence on the field.” The winner will be announced the night before the Super Bowl. 
Whitworth has been involved in several charitable efforts since he joined the Rams in 2017. Most recently, he donated a game-week check to a fund for victims of last month’s mass shooting in Thousand Oaks. Whitworth also has contributed to causes involving the Make-A-Wish Foundation and military veterans.

Report an Error Mack missed two games this season with an ankle injury but has nine sacks in 10 games. In last week’s overtime loss to the New York Giants, Mack had one sack and tied his season high with five tackles. 
“He plays with great urgency and juice every single play,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “He can really bend and turn on the edge, and then when he gets close to the quarterback, he is violently attacking the football.” 
Sacks aren’t great for an offense, but the Rams have a bigger issue. Mack has forced five fumbles this season, although he has only one in his last six games. Goff has lost three fumbles in his last two games, and while his pocket awareness is generally good, Goff seems prone to having the ball stripped. 
The Rams’ offensive line has received rightful praise this season for its consistency and strong play, but things haven’t been all rosy for this unit. The Rams have allowed the ninth-fewest sacks, but Goff has been dropped 26 times in 12 games this season, compared to his 25 sacks in 15 games in 2017. Now, the Rams face a Bears defense, led by Mack, that is strong up front.

“You definitely have a plan for it,” Goff said. “When a guy like (Mack) can affect the game, you have to be conscious of it through the week and have a plan for it. Yeah, be aware of where he is, but still play your game and focus on what you need to do.” 
Turnovers are important to the Bears. Their plus-12 margin is the best in the league, as is their total of 21 interceptions. Goff has turned over the ball four times in his last two games. 
So the Rams have some concerns, but so should the Bears, given that it’s been a couple months since another team proved capable of blocking Donald. He’s coming off one of the greatest efforts of his career, with two sacks and a game-turning forced fumble in the fourth quarter against the Lions. 
Donald, with 16.5 sacks and four games remaining, might even have an outside chance to break Michael Strahan’s single-season record of 22.5 set in 2001. 
“I’m just playing football,” Donald said. “If it happens, it happens. If it don’t, it don’t. I’m just doing my job and trying to fly around.” 
Now, Donald likely will face Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has missed the previous two games with a shoulder injury. The Bears have made no promises, but Trubisky appears to be on track to play against the Rams and Donald, who might not be great for Trubisky’s shoulder. 
Asked by Chicago reporters about avoiding re-injury, Trubisky said: “Being smart, trying to slide properly, trying not to be so unorthodox, picking up yardage and then just getting down when I need to get down. Getting out of bounds. And continue to stay aggressive. But like I said, I’m not going to go out there if I’m not 100 percent. I’m going to play my game. No reservations. Just go out there and do what I know how to do.”

Whitworth has been involved in several charitable efforts since he joined the Rams in 2017. Most recently, he donated a game-week check to a fund for victims of last month’s mass shooting in Thousand Oaks. Whitworth also has contributed to causes involving the Make-A-Wish Foundation and military veterans.

Report an Error Donald, with 16.5 sacks and four games remaining, might even have an outside chance to break Michael Strahan’s single-season record of 22.5 set in 2001. 
“I’m just playing football,” Donald said. “If it happens, it happens. If it don’t, it don’t. I’m just doing my job and trying to fly around.” 
Now, Donald likely will face Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has missed the previous two games with a shoulder injury. The Bears have made no promises, but Trubisky appears to be on track to play against the Rams and Donald, who might not be great for Trubisky’s shoulder. 
Asked by Chicago reporters about avoiding re-injury, Trubisky said: “Being smart, trying to slide properly, trying not to be so unorthodox, picking up yardage and then just getting down when I need to get down. Getting out of bounds. And continue to stay aggressive. But like I said, I’m not going to go out there if I’m not 100 percent. I’m going to play my game. No reservations. Just go out there and do what I know how to do.” 
NO HESITATION
Rams cornerback Aqib Talib is expected to have a full workload this week, McVay said before Thursday’s practice at Cal Lutheran. Last week in Detroit, in his first game back after ankle surgery, Talib played only the first half (26 plays), and the Lions totaled three points and 87 passing yards. 
“He’s good,” McVay said. “We’ll hopefully not have to have him on any sort of pitch count at all this week. That was kind of the goal all along. It sounds like the field has been in good condition in Chicago, from what I understand. Unless something sets us back, he’s going to be a full go, from the start to the finish.”

Talib and the Rams will face a talented, balanced Chicago pass game and has split catches among receivers Taylor Gabriel (54) and Allen Robinson (41), tight end Trey Burton (38) and running back Tarik Cohen (a team-high 59). A return to full action by Talib at least will give the Rams two solid cornerbacks and perhaps some insurance for Marcus Peters, who has been nursing an ankle injury. 
“As long as he’s ready to go, we’re going to let him play,” defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said of Talib.

102,https://www.dailynews.com/2018/12/06/rams-aaron-donald-and-bears-khalil-mack-have-stayed-close-from-first-round-to-big-money/,"Trending: THOUSAND OAKS – Two defensive player of the year awards, and $276 million in contract money. That’s what Aaron Donald and Khalil Mack have totaled since they last faced each other, as rookies. 
They’re almost like fraternal twins. Drafted eight spots apart in the 2014 first round, Donald and Mack have taken different paths to dominance, but they are considered two of their generation’s top pass-rushers, and they’ll meet Sunday when the Rams travel to Chicago in a game with great meaning for both teams.

Add another number: 105. That’s the combined number of career sacks for Donald and Mack. Listen closely, and it’s possible to hear groaning from quarterbacks Mitchell Trubisky and Jared Goff. 
“When you face those great rushers, it’s a challenge for you, but it’s one you look forward to,” Rams left tackle Andrew Whitworth said. “You’ve got to do your best to give us time to complete plays and move the football.” 	


Donald, with a league-high 16.5 sacks, is on his way to a second consecutive defensive player of the year award, and perhaps league MVP consideration. He’s an absolute force inside, and for decades to come, the story of the 2014 draft will be about the 12 teams that passed him up before the Rams grabbed him. 
Donald indicated Thursday that he and Mack aren’t close friends but that they’re cordial, and there’s clearly respect there. 
						
“He’s a heck of a football player,” Donald said. “He can do a lot of things. He’s a play maker and a big-time player.” 
Not every team made a big mistake in that draft, though. Oakland drafted Mack at No. 5 and didn’t regret it, at least until this past August, when Donald and Mack, tied together again, made league history. 
Both players’ rookie contracts were about to expire, and both teams insisted they weren’t waiting for the other player to sign. Oakland wasn’t waiting to see how much the Rams gave Donald, and vice versa. 	


Right. Sure thing. It just so happened, then, that the day after the Rams gave Donald a new six-year, $135-million contract, the Raiders – apparently unwilling to match that – traded Mack to Chicago. Mack then topped Donald by signing a six-year, $141-million deal, the biggest ever for a defensive player. 
Neither team has been disappointed. The Rams clinched the NFC West last week, and the Bears lead the NFC North and are on track for their first playoff appearance and division championship since 2010. 
Mack missed two games this season with an ankle injury but has nine sacks in 10 games. In last week’s overtime loss to the New York Giants, Mack had one sack and tied his season high with five tackles. 
“He plays with great urgency and juice every single play,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “He can really bend and turn on the edge, and then when he gets close to the quarterback, he is violently attacking the football.” 
Sacks aren’t great for an offense, but the Rams have a bigger issue. Mack has forced five fumbles this season, although he has only one in his last six games. Goff has lost three fumbles in his last two games, and while his pocket awareness is generally good, Goff seems prone to having the ball stripped. 
The Rams’ offensive line has received rightful praise this season for its consistency and strong play, but things haven’t been all rosy for this unit. The Rams have allowed the ninth-fewest sacks, but Goff has been dropped 26 times in 12 games this season, compared to his 25 sacks in 15 games in 2017. Now, the Rams face a Bears defense, led by Mack, that is strong up front.

“You definitely have a plan for it,” Goff said. “When a guy like (Mack) can affect the game, you have to be conscious of it through the week and have a plan for it. Yeah, be aware of where he is, but still play your game and focus on what you need to do.” 
Turnovers are important to the Bears. Their plus-12 margin is the best in the league, as is their total of 21 interceptions. Goff has turned over the ball four times in his last two games. 
So the Rams have some concerns, but so should the Bears, given that it’s been a couple months since another team proved capable of blocking Donald. He’s coming off one of the greatest efforts of his career, with two sacks and a game-turning forced fumble in the fourth quarter against the Lions. 
Donald, with 16.5 sacks and four games remaining, might even have an outside chance to break Michael Strahan’s single-season record of 22.5 set in 2001. 
“I’m just playing football,” Donald said. “If it happens, it happens. If it don’t, it don’t. I’m just doing my job and trying to fly around.” 
Now, Donald likely will face Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has missed the previous two games with a shoulder injury. The Bears have made no promises, but Trubisky appears to be on track to play against the Rams and Donald, who might not be great for Trubisky’s shoulder. 
Asked by Chicago reporters about avoiding re-injury, Trubisky said: “Being smart, trying to slide properly, trying not to be so unorthodox, picking up yardage and then just getting down when I need to get down. Getting out of bounds. And continue to stay aggressive. But like I said, I’m not going to go out there if I’m not 100 percent. I’m going to play my game. No reservations. Just go out there and do what I know how to do.”

“He’s good,” McVay said. “We’ll hopefully not have to have him on any sort of pitch count at all this week. That was kind of the goal all along. It sounds like the field has been in good condition in Chicago, from what I understand. Unless something sets us back, he’s going to be a full go, from the start to the finish.”

So the Rams have some concerns, but so should the Bears, given that it’s been a couple months since another team proved capable of blocking Donald. He’s coming off one of the greatest efforts of his career, with two sacks and a game-turning forced fumble in the fourth quarter against the Lions. 
Donald, with 16.5 sacks and four games remaining, might even have an outside chance to break Michael Strahan’s single-season record of 22.5 set in 2001. 
“I’m just playing football,” Donald said. “If it happens, it happens. If it don’t, it don’t. I’m just doing my job and trying to fly around.” 
Now, Donald likely will face Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has missed the previous two games with a shoulder injury. The Bears have made no promises, but Trubisky appears to be on track to play against the Rams and Donald, who might not be great for Trubisky’s shoulder. 
Asked by Chicago reporters about avoiding re-injury, Trubisky said: “Being smart, trying to slide properly, trying not to be so unorthodox, picking up yardage and then just getting down when I need to get down. Getting out of bounds. And continue to stay aggressive. But like I said, I’m not going to go out there if I’m not 100 percent. I’m going to play my game. No reservations. Just go out there and do what I know how to do.” 
NO HESITATION
Rams cornerback Aqib Talib is expected to have a full workload this week, McVay said before Thursday’s practice at Cal Lutheran. Last week in Detroit, in his first game back after ankle surgery, Talib played only the first half (26 plays), and the Lions totaled three points and 87 passing yards. 
“He’s good,” McVay said. “We’ll hopefully not have to have him on any sort of pitch count at all this week. That was kind of the goal all along. It sounds like the field has been in good condition in Chicago, from what I understand. Unless something sets us back, he’s going to be a full go, from the start to the finish.”

Talib and the Rams will face a talented, balanced Chicago pass game and has split catches among receivers Taylor Gabriel (54) and Allen Robinson (41), tight end Trey Burton (38) and running back Tarik Cohen (a team-high 59). A return to full action by Talib at least will give the Rams two solid cornerbacks and perhaps some insurance for Marcus Peters, who has been nursing an ankle injury. 
“As long as he’s ready to go, we’re going to let him play,” defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said of Talib. 
BIG HONOR FOR WHITWORTH
The Rams selected left tackle Andrew Whitworth as their nominee for the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which annually recognizes a player “for outstanding community service activities off the field, as well as excellence on the field.” The winner will be announced the night before the Super Bowl. 
Whitworth has been involved in several charitable efforts since he joined the Rams in 2017. Most recently, he donated a game-week check to a fund for victims of last month’s mass shooting in Thousand Oaks. Whitworth also has contributed to causes involving the Make-A-Wish Foundation and military veterans.

Report an Error Add another number: 105. That’s the combined number of career sacks for Donald and Mack. Listen closely, and it’s possible to hear groaning from quarterbacks Mitchell Trubisky and Jared Goff. 
“When you face those great rushers, it’s a challenge for you, but it’s one you look forward to,” Rams left tackle Andrew Whitworth said. “You’ve got to do your best to give us time to complete plays and move the football.” 	


Donald, with a league-high 16.5 sacks, is on his way to a second consecutive defensive player of the year award, and perhaps league MVP consideration. He’s an absolute force inside, and for decades to come, the story of the 2014 draft will be about the 12 teams that passed him up before the Rams grabbed him. 
Donald indicated Thursday that he and Mack aren’t close friends but that they’re cordial, and there’s clearly respect there. 
						
“He’s a heck of a football player,” Donald said. “He can do a lot of things. He’s a play maker and a big-time player.” 
Not every team made a big mistake in that draft, though. Oakland drafted Mack at No. 5 and didn’t regret it, at least until this past August, when Donald and Mack, tied together again, made league history. 
Both players’ rookie contracts were about to expire, and both teams insisted they weren’t waiting for the other player to sign. Oakland wasn’t waiting to see how much the Rams gave Donald, and vice versa. 	


Right. Sure thing. It just so happened, then, that the day after the Rams gave Donald a new six-year, $135-million contract, the Raiders – apparently unwilling to match that – traded Mack to Chicago. Mack then topped Donald by signing a six-year, $141-million deal, the biggest ever for a defensive player. 
Neither team has been disappointed. The Rams clinched the NFC West last week, and the Bears lead the NFC North and are on track for their first playoff appearance and division championship since 2010. 
Mack missed two games this season with an ankle injury but has nine sacks in 10 games. In last week’s overtime loss to the New York Giants, Mack had one sack and tied his season high with five tackles. 
“He plays with great urgency and juice every single play,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “He can really bend and turn on the edge, and then when he gets close to the quarterback, he is violently attacking the football.” 
Sacks aren’t great for an offense, but the Rams have a bigger issue. Mack has forced five fumbles this season, although he has only one in his last six games. Goff has lost three fumbles in his last two games, and while his pocket awareness is generally good, Goff seems prone to having the ball stripped. 
The Rams’ offensive line has received rightful praise this season for its consistency and strong play, but things haven’t been all rosy for this unit. The Rams have allowed the ninth-fewest sacks, but Goff has been dropped 26 times in 12 games this season, compared to his 25 sacks in 15 games in 2017. Now, the Rams face a Bears defense, led by Mack, that is strong up front.

“He plays with great urgency and juice every single play,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “He can really bend and turn on the edge, and then when he gets close to the quarterback, he is violently attacking the football.” 
Sacks aren’t great for an offense, but the Rams have a bigger issue. Mack has forced five fumbles this season, although he has only one in his last six games. Goff has lost three fumbles in his last two games, and while his pocket awareness is generally good, Goff seems prone to having the ball stripped. 
The Rams’ offensive line has received rightful praise this season for its consistency and strong play, but things haven’t been all rosy for this unit. The Rams have allowed the ninth-fewest sacks, but Goff has been dropped 26 times in 12 games this season, compared to his 25 sacks in 15 games in 2017. Now, the Rams face a Bears defense, led by Mack, that is strong up front.

“You definitely have a plan for it,” Goff said. “When a guy like (Mack) can affect the game, you have to be conscious of it through the week and have a plan for it. Yeah, be aware of where he is, but still play your game and focus on what you need to do.” 
Turnovers are important to the Bears. Their plus-12 margin is the best in the league, as is their total of 21 interceptions. Goff has turned over the ball four times in his last two games. 
So the Rams have some concerns, but so should the Bears, given that it’s been a couple months since another team proved capable of blocking Donald. He’s coming off one of the greatest efforts of his career, with two sacks and a game-turning forced fumble in the fourth quarter against the Lions. 
Donald, with 16.5 sacks and four games remaining, might even have an outside chance to break Michael Strahan’s single-season record of 22.5 set in 2001. 
“I’m just playing football,” Donald said. “If it happens, it happens. If it don’t, it don’t. I’m just doing my job and trying to fly around.” 
Now, Donald likely will face Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has missed the previous two games with a shoulder injury. The Bears have made no promises, but Trubisky appears to be on track to play against the Rams and Donald, who might not be great for Trubisky’s shoulder. 
Asked by Chicago reporters about avoiding re-injury, Trubisky said: “Being smart, trying to slide properly, trying not to be so unorthodox, picking up yardage and then just getting down when I need to get down. Getting out of bounds. And continue to stay aggressive. But like I said, I’m not going to go out there if I’m not 100 percent. I’m going to play my game. No reservations. Just go out there and do what I know how to do.” 
NO HESITATION
Rams cornerback Aqib Talib is expected to have a full workload this week, McVay said before Thursday’s practice at Cal Lutheran. Last week in Detroit, in his first game back after ankle surgery, Talib played only the first half (26 plays), and the Lions totaled three points and 87 passing yards. 
“He’s good,” McVay said. “We’ll hopefully not have to have him on any sort of pitch count at all this week. That was kind of the goal all along. It sounds like the field has been in good condition in Chicago, from what I understand. Unless something sets us back, he’s going to be a full go, from the start to the finish.”

Talib and the Rams will face a talented, balanced Chicago pass game and has split catches among receivers Taylor Gabriel (54) and Allen Robinson (41), tight end Trey Burton (38) and running back Tarik Cohen (a team-high 59). A return to full action by Talib at least will give the Rams two solid cornerbacks and perhaps some insurance for Marcus Peters, who has been nursing an ankle injury.

BIG HONOR FOR WHITWORTH
The Rams selected left tackle Andrew Whitworth as their nominee for the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which annually recognizes a player “for outstanding community service activities off the field, as well as excellence on the field.” The winner will be announced the night before the Super Bowl. 
Whitworth has been involved in several charitable efforts since he joined the Rams in 2017. Most recently, he donated a game-week check to a fund for victims of last month’s mass shooting in Thousand Oaks. Whitworth also has contributed to causes involving the Make-A-Wish Foundation and military veterans.

Report an Error Not every team made a big mistake in that draft, though. Oakland drafted Mack at No. 5 and didn’t regret it, at least until this past August, when Donald and Mack, tied together again, made league history. 
Both players’ rookie contracts were about to expire, and both teams insisted they weren’t waiting for the other player to sign. Oakland wasn’t waiting to see how much the Rams gave Donald, and vice versa. 	


Right. Sure thing. It just so happened, then, that the day after the Rams gave Donald a new six-year, $135-million contract, the Raiders – apparently unwilling to match that – traded Mack to Chicago. Mack then topped Donald by signing a six-year, $141-million deal, the biggest ever for a defensive player. 
Neither team has been disappointed. The Rams clinched the NFC West last week, and the Bears lead the NFC North and are on track for their first playoff appearance and division championship since 2010. 
Mack missed two games this season with an ankle injury but has nine sacks in 10 games. In last week’s overtime loss to the New York Giants, Mack had one sack and tied his season high with five tackles. 
“He plays with great urgency and juice every single play,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “He can really bend and turn on the edge, and then when he gets close to the quarterback, he is violently attacking the football.” 
Sacks aren’t great for an offense, but the Rams have a bigger issue. Mack has forced five fumbles this season, although he has only one in his last six games. Goff has lost three fumbles in his last two games, and while his pocket awareness is generally good, Goff seems prone to having the ball stripped. 
The Rams’ offensive line has received rightful praise this season for its consistency and strong play, but things haven’t been all rosy for this unit.

Talib and the Rams will face a talented, balanced Chicago pass game and has split catches among receivers Taylor Gabriel (54) and Allen Robinson (41), tight end Trey Burton (38) and running back Tarik Cohen (a team-high 59). A return to full action by Talib at least will give the Rams two solid cornerbacks and perhaps some insurance for Marcus Peters, who has been nursing an ankle injury. 
“As long as he’s ready to go, we’re going to let him play,” defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said of Talib. 
BIG HONOR FOR WHITWORTH
The Rams selected left tackle Andrew Whitworth as their nominee for the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which annually recognizes a player “for outstanding community service activities off the field, as well as excellence on the field.” The winner will be announced the night before the Super Bowl. 
Whitworth has been involved in several charitable efforts since he joined the Rams in 2017. Most recently, he donated a game-week check to a fund for victims of last month’s mass shooting in Thousand Oaks. Whitworth also has contributed to causes involving the Make-A-Wish Foundation and military veterans.

Report an Error “He plays with great urgency and juice every single play,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “He can really bend and turn on the edge, and then when he gets close to the quarterback, he is violently attacking the football.” 
Sacks aren’t great for an offense, but the Rams have a bigger issue. Mack has forced five fumbles this season, although he has only one in his last six games. Goff has lost three fumbles in his last two games, and while his pocket awareness is generally good, Goff seems prone to having the ball stripped. 
The Rams’ offensive line has received rightful praise this season for its consistency and strong play, but things haven’t been all rosy for this unit. The Rams have allowed the ninth-fewest sacks, but Goff has been dropped 26 times in 12 games this season, compared to his 25 sacks in 15 games in 2017. Now, the Rams face a Bears defense, led by Mack, that is strong up front.

“You definitely have a plan for it,” Goff said. “When a guy like (Mack) can affect the game, you have to be conscious of it through the week and have a plan for it. Yeah, be aware of where he is, but still play your game and focus on what you need to do.” 
Turnovers are important to the Bears. Their plus-12 margin is the best in the league, as is their total of 21 interceptions. Goff has turned over the ball four times in his last two games. 
So the Rams have some concerns, but so should the Bears, given that it’s been a couple months since another team proved capable of blocking Donald. He’s coming off one of the greatest efforts of his career, with two sacks and a game-turning forced fumble in the fourth quarter against the Lions. 
Donald, with 16.5 sacks and four games remaining, might even have an outside chance to break Michael Strahan’s single-season record of 22.5 set in 2001. 
“I’m just playing football,” Donald said. “If it happens, it happens. If it don’t, it don’t. I’m just doing my job and trying to fly around.” 
Now, Donald likely will face Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has missed the previous two games with a shoulder injury. The Bears have made no promises, but Trubisky appears to be on track to play against the Rams and Donald, who might not be great for Trubisky’s shoulder. 
Asked by Chicago reporters about avoiding re-injury, Trubisky said: “Being smart, trying to slide properly, trying not to be so unorthodox, picking up yardage and then just getting down when I need to get down. Getting out of bounds. And continue to stay aggressive. But like I said, I’m not going to go out there if I’m not 100 percent. I’m going to play my game. No reservations. Just go out there and do what I know how to do.” 
NO HESITATION
Rams cornerback Aqib Talib is expected to have a full workload this week, McVay said before Thursday’s practice at Cal Lutheran. Last week in Detroit, in his first game back after ankle surgery, Talib played only the first half (26 plays), and the Lions totaled three points and 87 passing yards. 
“He’s good,” McVay said. “We’ll hopefully not have to have him on any sort of pitch count at all this week. That was kind of the goal all along. It sounds like the field has been in good condition in Chicago, from what I understand. Unless something sets us back, he’s going to be a full go, from the start to the finish.”

Report an Error Now, Donald likely will face Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has missed the previous two games with a shoulder injury. The Bears have made no promises, but Trubisky appears to be on track to play against the Rams and Donald, who might not be great for Trubisky’s shoulder. 
Asked by Chicago reporters about avoiding re-injury, Trubisky said: “Being smart, trying to slide properly, trying not to be so unorthodox, picking up yardage and then just getting down when I need to get down. Getting out of bounds. And continue to stay aggressive. But like I said, I’m not going to go out there if I’m not 100 percent. I’m going to play my game. No reservations. Just go out there and do what I know how to do.” 
NO HESITATION
Rams cornerback Aqib Talib is expected to have a full workload this week, McVay said before Thursday’s practice at Cal Lutheran. Last week in Detroit, in his first game back after ankle surgery, Talib played only the first half (26 plays), and the Lions totaled three points and 87 passing yards. 
“He’s good,” McVay said. “We’ll hopefully not have to have him on any sort of pitch count at all this week. That was kind of the goal all along. It sounds like the field has been in good condition in Chicago, from what I understand. Unless something sets us back, he’s going to be a full go, from the start to the finish.”

Talib and the Rams will face a talented, balanced Chicago pass game and has split catches among receivers Taylor Gabriel (54) and Allen Robinson (41), tight end Trey Burton (38) and running back Tarik Cohen (a team-high 59). A return to full action by Talib at least will give the Rams two solid cornerbacks and perhaps some insurance for Marcus Peters, who has been nursing an ankle injury.

X OUR PICKS: Many folks decorate their house and the tree at this time of year. I prefer to read reports that are far more interesting than skimming through a Yuletide shopping circular for a last-minute gift. A few caught my eye this week: Kill the messenger? The Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy compiled a summary on several recent studies on news coverage of mass shootings, ranging from schools to inside homes and street corners. We, and I mean a collective we with many exceptions, didn’t fare so well. One study earlier this year found that readers preferred reading articles on “courageous” bystanders than on the gunmen or even the victims. The study, published earlier this year in the American Behavorial Scientist, surveyed 212 adults, aged 35 to 44 years old, and asked their interest in different aspects of mass shooting news coverage. Participants were presented different versions of the same news story in which the photos, font sizes, layout, main headline and pull-out quote were the same, according to the study. One story focused on the killer. One focused on a victim. And one story focused, as the study penned it, on a “hero student who stopped the attack.” Nearly 73 percent chose to read the hero story after the first paragraph. Nearly 57 percent of those chosen to read the story about the killer read past the first paragraph. I was surprised a lesser percentage — 52 percent — opted to read the victim story past the top. “Subjects’ greater interest in the hero-focused story may be interpreted as an information-seeking behavior, as it presumably would provide information about how to stop a mass murderer and avoid future victimization,” wrote the study researchers Jack Levin, a professor at Northeastern University, and Julie Wiest, a sociologist at West Chester University. My take: Solution-oriented pieces, whether about the actions of bystanders or a post-incident analysis of what went wrong or right, should always be prominently displayed as part of a comprehensive coverage of such events. Another study by Ohio State University researchers gauged how journalists profiled mass shooters by race and motivation. The researchers limited their analysis to shootings of four or more victims, excluding the gunman, from 2013 to 2015. The study’s main finding? News coverage of white and Latino shooters more often than not suggested that mental illness was to blame than did stories on black shooters. Here’s the mathematical breakdown: “The odds that white shooters will receive the mental illness frame are roughly 19 times greater than the odds for black shooters,” the researchers wrote in the study, which was published in the Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency “The odds that a Latino shooter will receive the mental illness frame are roughly 12 times greater when compared to blacks.” The research team also discovered that when journalists reported or insinuated that a white shooter was mentally ill, they tended to “establish the offender as a good person suffering from extreme life circumstances.” This happened only sometimes when the shooter was Latino and almost never when the shooter was black. My take: Implicit as well as explicit bias, anyone? Journalists are not immune. But one possible explanation could be that there’s more information gleaned from relatives, friends or neighbors about the diagnosed mental illness, behavior or perhaps treatment history of white shooters than perpetrators of color. Why? Mental illness remains a thornier stigma in communities of color and there is more lack of awareness and resources to address it. As a result, shooters go undiagnosed and those who know them or are close to them have little information when reporters or police come around asking questions. As a result, their actions are less scrutinized in that light. A third study analyzed attitudes of journalists on mass shooting news coverage. The study surveyed 1,318 newspaper reporters, editors, photographers and columnists — 60 percent men and 89.4 white. According to researchers at the University of Oregon’s School of Journalism and Communication, a slight majority of journalists agreed that coverage is “sensational” and that the way mass shootings are covered is an ethical issue. Meanwhile, journalists generally did not acknowledge a connection between mass shooting coverage and copycat shooters, although several studies have argued a connection in some cases. The study findings also detected a generation and newsroom diversity gap in attitudes. “Older journalists held a more favorable opinion of the state of mass shooting coverage, more strongly supported coverage of perpetrators, and were less receptive to the idea that mass shooting coverage is an ethical issue,” the study noted. It also found that editors had a more positive view of coverage than reporters and photographers and that white journalists had a much higher opinion of it than journalists of other races. My take: Not surprised by the findings at all, given the breakdown of the survey respondents. I’ve seen great, in-depth and smart coverage and I’ve seen and read sensationalist garbage. Rationally minded and concerned readers and consumers should always keep us on our toes. We should strive to do better. But I always remember the image of quite a number of subway straphangers heading to Wall Street or midtown Manhattan with a copy of the New York Times on the outside and one of the city tabloids tucked inside. It reminds me of human nature and people who put on appearances and say one thing on surveys and studies but also do another.

105,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/air-force-times/news/your-air-force/~3/mx10aHYY0VU/,"The Air Force could have prevented a former airman from buying a weapon and committing a mass shooting last year had investigators followed proper protocol, according to a Pentagon investigation of the incident released this week. The investigation casts doubt on the capabilities of Air Force Office of Special Investigations agents and the training of ordinary security forces airmen, according to the Defense Department Inspector General report, released Dec. 6. The findings, and a follow-up review across the DoD, could have implications across all the armed forces investigative arms. “We are currently conducting a follow-up review to assess the progress throughout the DoD in ensuring that all fingerprints required to be submitted to the FBI are in fact submitted,” DoD IG officials said. “This review will also assess whether DoD law enforcement agencies submit DNA to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System, as well as criminal history data, mental health information, and sex offender information, as required.” On Nov. 5, 2017, former airman Devin Kelley shot and killed 26 people and wounded 22 others at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas. After being shot by citizen responders, Kelley fled from the church in his vehicle and later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Kelley was able to purchase a firearm from a federally licensed dealer even though he had a disqualifying conviction. Kelley, who enlisted in 2010, served as a logistical readiness airman at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. In 2014, he was discharged from the Air Force after being convicted of assault. Because of that conviction, the Air Force should have sent his fingerprints and final disposition report to the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division. “If Kelley’s fingerprints were submitted to the FBI, he would have been prohibited from purchasing a firearm from a licensed firearms dealer,” DoD IG officials said in their 131-page report. The DoD IG conducted an investigation into Kelly’s actions to examine why the Air Force did not provide his fingerprints to the FBI, as was required. The office’s report found that the service had four different opportunities to submit the fingerprints, all of which they failed to do. AFOSI Special Agents failed to follow proper training and provided little reasoning behind why they did not submit the information, other than the large case-load being handled by their office, the turnover of staff and the inexperience of newer agents. “These factors provide context for the failures,"" investigators said. “However, they do not excuse the failures. The investigators and confinement personnel had a duty to know, and should have known, the DoD and USAF fingerprint policies, and should have followed them. The failures had drastic consequences and should not have occurred.” The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force said ""the failure in reporting Kelley’s criminal history was not an isolated event unique to this case or to Holloman Air Force Base where the investigation unfolded.” Lack of compliance with reporting requirements across the services was highlighted in multiple DoD IG audits that took place prior to the Texas shooting. Some corrective actions were implemented, but they were not timely or sufficient to achieve compliance across the force. Immediately following the mass shooting last year, the Air Force directed a review of all criminal history reporting requirements. This review, which was completed in late December 2017, generated 21 recommendations to correct deficiencies in criminal history reporting, 20 of which have already been completed, Air Force spokesman Ann Stefanek said in a statement. The remaining recommendation, primarily focused on enhancing efficiency, will be completed in July. The Air Force intends to correct all legacy case files going back to 1998, Stefanek added. The New Mexico flag waves in the breeze at the front gate of Holloman Air Force Base. Kelley was stationed here during his military service. (Airman 1st Class Deandre Curtiss/Air Force) The first opportunity to submit fingerprints occurred in 2011. Kelley had already failed out of tech school to become a network intelligence analyst, and was reclassified to be a traffic management apprentice. During this time, he married a former classmate with a son from a previous relationship. Kelley repeatedly hit his new stepson and wife. After the boy was hospitalized for various injuries, an investigation was initiated in June 2011. AFOSI Detachment 225, at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, conducted the investigation. This was the first opportunity to collect Kelley’s fingerprints. But Det. 225 leadership did not create a note in the investigative case file stating that the fingerprint card had been reviewed in accordance with AFOSI policy. As the investigation progressed, Kelley returned to work and repeatedly received letters of counseling and reprimand from leadership for his failure to attend training classes and for his use of a cellphone during duty hours, as well as verbal confrontations with superiors. The 49th Security Forces Squadron Office of Investigations conducted a subject interview with Kelley in February 2012 related to an assault on his wife, which violated Article 128 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Investigators wrote a report following the interview, which said Kelley must turn over a handgun he purchased at the Holloman base exchange to his acting first sergeant, who then turned it in to security forces. “This is the second opportunity to collect Kelley’s fingerprints,” the DoD IG report reads. Kelley continued to have problems at work, and with his UCMJ hearing approaching, he was ordered to confinement in June 2012. An AFOSI special agent conducts a fingerprint scan. Agents' failure to submit fingerprints to the FBI in the case of a mass shooter led to a DoD IG review of their policies. (Airman 1st Class Donald Knechtel/Air Force) (Airman 1st Class Donald Knechtel/28th Bomb Wing Public Affairs) Kelley’s commander prepared the pre-trial confinement package, which included a memorandum stating that the commander was convinced Kelley was “dangerous and likely to harm someone if released.” The commander also cited an internet search by Kelley for body armor and firearms as further justification for the pre-trial confinement. Kelley was identified as a flight risk and he was ordered into confinement at the 49th Security Forces Squadron confinement facility. In June 2012, AFOSI special agents conducted another interview with Kelley. The record from that encounter states that his fingerprints were collected, but there were no corresponding fingerprint cards in the case file, according to the DoD IG. “This is the third opportunity to collect Kelley’s fingerprints,"" DoD IG officials said. The final opportunity came in November 2012, when Kelley was convicted of assaulting his wife and her son during a general court-martial. He was reduced in rank to E-1, ordered into confinement for 12 months and given a bad conduct discharge. Kelley was confined to Holloman before transfer to a larger facility. Air Force Corrections System policy requires all post-trial inmates to have their fingerprints collected and submitted to the FBI during in-processing. However, there is no record of the confinement facility collecting or submitting Kelley’s fingerprints, according to the DoD IG. This was the fourth opportunity for the Air Force to collect Kelley’s fingerprints and the first opportunity to submit a final disposition report for his criminal history. In December 2012, AFOSI received an AF Form 1359, stating that Kelley’s conviction is a crime of domestic violence and requires DNA processing. Receipt of those forms also requires AFOSI to submit Kelley’s fingerprints and final disposition to the FBI, if not already submitted. Rachel Vasquez places flowers in a fence for the victims of the shooting outside of the Sutherland Springs Baptist Church following a service held at a temporary site on Nov. 12, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas. (Eric Gay/AP) (Eric Gay/AP) This was the second opportunity for the Air Force to submit the disposition of his conviction. But it did not occur, even though the special agent in charge of Det. 225 certified in the case management system checklist that Kelley’s fingerprints were submitted to the FBI. “We attempted to assess the environment in which these special agents and supervisors worked when they failed to collect and submit the fingerprints and final disposition reports,” DoD IG investigators said. ""We found several factors that created a challenging work environment. These factors included inexperienced special agents, individual personal issues at the time, leadership gaps, and a high operations tempo."" For example, the report said, five different special agents led AFOSI Det. 225 in the space of approximately four months; three of them were temporarily assigned for periods of roughly one to 10 weeks. In addition, four of the nine special agents assigned to Det. 225 were probationary agents with little to no experience in criminal investigations. These difficulties were compounded by the high operations tempo of the office, according to the report. Some agents told investigators that they received no formal training on submitting fingerprints, but the DoD IG found that to be untrue. “Six of the AFOSI Detachment 225 Special Agents told us that they received no formal training on the submission of fingerprints,” DoD IG investigators said. “Yet, we found that the AFOSI did have fingerprint submission training at the Criminal Investigator Training Program and AFOSI Basic Special Investigators Course.” Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church last year, told a military judge in 2012 that he ""would never allow myself to hurt someone"" again while confessing to violently hitting his stepson. (Texas Department of Public Safety) (AP) Meanwhile, the training program for Air Force security forces airmen did not include instruction on the collection and submission of fingerprints and final disposition information to the FBI. “In sum, we concluded that there was no valid reason for the [Air Force’s] failures to submit Kelley’s fingerprints and final disposition report to the FBI CJIS Division,” investigators said. The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force highlighted some of the corrective actions the service has undertaken in the wake of their own review late last year. In the near-term, AFOSI and Air Force security forces will disseminate updated guidance and conduct command-wide training on criminal history reporting guidelines and procedures, service leadership said in their statement. Commanders at all levels will also clearly articulate to airmen the need for total compliance and to assess local limitations, if any exist. When all corrective actions are implemented, the Air Force Audit Agency will conduct a review to ensure effectiveness. That audit will be completed Jan. 11, 2019, the service said. The Air Force is also in an ongoing process of sharing all lessons learned with the other services, service officials said in their statement. The DoD IG’s methodology for this investigation included a multi-disciplinary team of special agents, investigative specialists and attorneys. The Pentagon offices subpoenaed Kelley’s criminal history and mental health records, and the team conducted 41 witness interviews, including interviews of Kelley’s ex-wife, his second wife and his father.

Following the November 2017 mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, the Air Force confirmed that airman Devin Patrick Kelley was court-martialed in 2012  on two charges of assaulting his wife and stepson. The 26-year-old, who had been based in New Mexico, was confined for a year, saw his rank reduced and given a bad conduct discharge in 2014. But the Air Force should have also submitted his fingerprints to the FBI, and failed to do so on four occasions, the Defense Department's 131-page inspector general report found. Kelley's conviction should have also triggered the Air Force to send a final disposition report to the agency, which would have put him in the FBI's criminal history database and potentially prevented him from legally buying a gun. Instead, he passed federally mandated background checks and purchased four firearms from licensed dealers. According to the report, Kelley used three of the guns he bought for the massacre at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. Armed citizens shot at Kelley as he fled in his car; he later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. One reason for the lapse in reporting of Kelley's fingerprints to the FBI occurred when a case agent investigating the domestic assault said they didn't know it was a requirement. Other agents could not give a ""clear, supportable reason or explanation"" for why Kelley's fingerprints were not submitted to federal authorities, the report said. ""The investigators and confinement personnel had a duty to know, and should have known"" the policies, the report added, and ""the failures had drastic consequences and should not have occurred."" In the wake of the shooting, Air Force officials asked the inspector general to look into Kelley's past and combed through its databases for other cases where fingerprints were not given to the FBI. In its report, the inspector general gives several recommendations for the Air Force, including implementing a background check system during recruiting. It was found that Kelley had multiple instances of alleged criminal activity before entering the Air Force, including one just days before he became active. Investigators said the attack occurred after a domestic dispute Kelley had with his mother-in-law, a member of the church who wasn't present that day. The victims ranged from a pregnant woman and her unborn child to a 77-year-old grandfather, and the shooting became the deadliest inside a house of worship in modern U.S. history.

108,http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/pf/~3/x5wUns3uObc/story.asp,"A GoFundMe page to raise money for President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall, created on Dec. 16, has raked in over $19.7 million in just over three weeks with an ultimate goal of $1 billion, and inspired at least one competing page dedicated to paying for ladders to get people over said wall (that page has so far raised over $$160,805 with a $100 million goal after being established on Dec. 19). The dueling pages are the latest example of how crowd-funding sites have become political battlegrounds in an increasingly divided America, with the rapidly-raised money a weapon wielded to support causes at both ends of the political spectrum. But who has the upper hand? Donations poured into fundraising site GoFundMe in 2018 and the largest campaigns may reveal the political leanings of many of the donors. Don’t miss:Trump calls illegal immigration a ‘crisis,’ but doesn’t declare emergency Two of the six most popular funds created last year skew liberal — #Metoo-inspired Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund (No. 1 with $24.2 million) and the gun control campaign March for Our Lives (No. 4 with $15.1 million) — but the GoFundMe page for President Trump’s, a cause widely supported by conservatives, remains at No. 2. Many people using GoFundMe in 2018 were also donating for the first time. In fact, 61% of those who gave money in 2018 were first-time donors. (The fastest-growing areas for donations are events, family and animals.) It’s not clear whether progressive causes are traditionally more popular on crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe or whether there’s simply been a backlash or — at the very least — a strong emotive reaction to some of President Trump’s most socially and politically divisive policies. In addition to the president’s pledge to build a wall on the Southern border with Mexico, for instance, Trump has vowed to restrict the number of immigrants and refugees entering the U.S. “
        ‘People can vote for Donald Trump and hate the separation of children. They can vote Democrat and still think the wall is a good idea.’
        ” “It’s not surprising that political causes are popular this year because people on the left are really angry about policies on the right,” said David Callahan, author of “The Givers: Wealth, Power and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age” and founder of Inside Philanthropy, who like all the commentators in this story, spoke to MarketWatch before the GoFundMe page for Trump’s border wall was created. “But a few years from now if we have a Democratic president, we may have a lot of successful crowdfunding from the right.” GoFundMe’s latest figures, released earlier this month, are supported by other recent charitable data, which show a significant uptick in progressive social and scientific causes. The number of campaigns addressing gender reassignment on YouCaring, a crowdfunding platform that was purchased by GoFundMe in 2018, increased by 78% year over year, while fertility treatments rose by 36.5% and social justice causes increased by 34%. People appear to have found a way to make a difference with their smartphones instead of “liking” posts on Facebook and Twitter

        -0.10%.
       “Strikingly, the number of fundraisers with ‘immigration’ as a key topic increased by 117% in the last year, and those with ‘climate change’ by 112%, though both represent a relatively small proportion of all YouCaring fundraisers,” according to that organization’s annual report released earlier this year.

        ‘It’s not surprising that political causes are popular this year, because people on the left are really angry about policies on the right.’ 
        ” “It’s primarily a matter of timing,” said David L. Thompson, vice president of public policy for the National Council of Nonprofits, the nation’s largest network of nonprofit organizations. “Younger donors are asking, ‘What are the hot issues?’ You’re donating using your phone and that’s one of the flash points affecting people that aren’t used to having a philanthropy budget, and those people that aren’t used to participating in longstanding movements.” Each administration brings its own set of policies and each generation their causes, he said. “Had it been the Obama administration? Perhaps it would have been more conservative,” he added. “This administration has caused people to react. It may come across as liberal now, but it’s a matter of timing. When you’re crowdfunding, you’re not thinking in terms of charitable tax deductions, you’re acting upon your emotions of the day.” The 24/7 news cycle triggers people and helps drive donations, he added. “Unless they’re giving to a political party, people are reacting to policies and the news,” Thompson added. “People can vote for Donald Trump and hate the separation of children. They can vote Democrat and still think the wall is a good idea. Policies are what people respond to. When people are responding to immigration, they are responding to a public policy issue.” Also see:How to avoid GoFundMe scams on #GivingTuesday Politics means different things to different people, he said. “For that reason, I don’t use the word political,” Thompson says. “You could talk to five people and come up with seven definitions of what political means. Young people are more agitated. These issues are generating strong reaction and they want to do something.” Most people are one click away from giving to a cause close to their heart. “It’s very easy to do something about it now,” he added. There is, however, another reason Thompson shies away from “conservative” and “liberal” when talking about donations. Charities don’t tend to get involved in the machinations on Capitol Hill, and avoid supporting or denouncing political figures. “To maintain their tax-exempt status, charitable nonprofits cannot be politically partisan, but they can have strong public views on policy matters like immigration or abortion or marriage,” he said. “The majority of charitable nonprofits like it that way.” What’s more, Alaska — a “red” state that voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election with 51.2% of the vote — was named as the most generous state for 2018. However, Alaska was followed by a slew of “blue” states who voted for Hillary Clinton: Massachusetts, Colorado, Washington and Vermont, California, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey and Oregon. (The results were calculated as donations per capita.) “
        ‘Strikingly, the number of fundraisers with immigration as a key topic increased by 117% in the last year, and those with climate change by 112%.’
        ” Other dynamics: The 2018 YouCaring report found that women are typically on average twice as likely to donate money online than men, with younger generations displaying a smaller donation gap between genders. However, when men do donate online, they tend to give larger sums than women. That could be because they tend to earn more. (Government data suggests women earn approximately 83 cents for every dollar earned by a man, an issue influenced in part by occupation.)

       fundraising features have raised more than $1 billion since they were introduced in 2015. Here are the top 6 fundraising campaigns on GoFundMe in 2018, now including the campaign for President Trump’s border wall: A page raising money for legal defense funds to combat sex discrimination in the workplace raised more than $24.2 million since it was created on Dec. 20. The page was made in response to the growing #MeToo movement, in which women shared their experiences with harassment and sexual assault. The movement has raised a staggering amount of money since it took off in October 2017, according to Charity Navigator chief operating officer Larry Lieberman, with “many tens of millions” going to women’s causes as a result of issues brought up. The GoFundMe Time’s Up funds will be managed by the National Women’s Law Center, a national women’s legal rights association. It is still active and will continue to take donations into 2019. Brian Kolfage, who is a veteran and Purple Heart recipient, wrote: “Like a majority of those American citizens who voted to elect President Donald J. Trump, we voted for him to Make America Great Again. President Trump’s main campaign promise was to BUILD THE WALL. And as he’s followed through on just about every promise so far, this wall project needs to be completed still.” “As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today. Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.” Tragic accidents can hit people hard, and encourage them to help by digging deep into their pockets. One of the most successful fundraisers in GoFundMe history was the “funds for the Humbolt Broncos” page, which raised more than $15.1 million Canadian dollars ($11.4 in U.S. dollars) for the families of the Canadian hockey team killed in a bus crash in April 2018. The page got 1.9 million views within the first 24 hours of going live and more than 90,000 donations from 65 countries in just a few days. People raising money after reading about tragic news stories or seeing them reported on television has been a trend throughout 2018, according to Rob Solomon, GoFundMe’s chief executive officer. “This year, we saw social fundraising become an integral part of bigger movements that inspire others,” he said in a statement. After the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. on Feb. 14, which left 17 people dead, more than 60 fundraisers sprung up to support “March for Our Lives,” the anti-gun violence movement started by teenagers affected by the tragedy. Fundraisers were created for similar movements around the country to support tougher regulations for gun ownership, the GoFundMe report said. Social activism and donations among young people are on the rise, Solomon said. “It’s clear that with the youth of today, we are witnessing the next generation of change makers,” he said. “They borrow techniques from their predecessors, such as marches and protests, but they also leverage the most powerful new tools at their disposal: social networks.” Of course, many campaigns are non-partisan. Nearly 700,000 refugees have arrived in Bangladesh in recent months, “having been violently expelled from their homes by Buddhist extremists in Myanmar,” the Houses for Rohingya Refugees page states. “They have experienced and witnessed many atrocities. Most of these refugees have settled in two sprawling camps just over the border: Kutupalong and Balukhali. While aid agencies such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are doing their best to cope with the humanitarian crisis, most refugees are provided with only the basics they need to survive.” Another fundraiser that sprung out of a public tragedy, the Tree of Life Synagogue Funds page, is still taking donations and has raised more than $1.26 million since it was created on Oct. 27 following a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, which left 11 people dead. “Respond to this hateful act with your act of love today,” the charity description said. In addition to this GoFundMe, there was a 1,000% increase in donations to Jewish groups, CharityNavigator.org found. Ultimately, donating via smartphone is likely based on what’s happening in that exact moment. A donor could be spurred by a television commercial, cable news debate or dinner party conversation. Emotion, not politics, matters most, Callahan added. “Crowdfunding is most successful when it’s fueled by some kind of strong emotion, whether personal, social, or political,” he says. “After mass shootings, you’ll often see crowdfunding for those issues.” This story was updated on Jan. 9, 2019.

The death toll from California's deadliest wildfire on record dropped back to 85 people on Monday, after authorities discovered that separate bags of remains recovered from the Camp Fire were ""proven by DNA"" to be the same case. That shred of good news came as workers continue to clear debris and sift for remains in the area of Northern California hit by the Camp Fire. Eleven people are still missing, according to the Butte County Sheriff's Office, so it's possible the number of victims could still rise. Authorities announced on November 25 that the fire, which had raged for over two weeks in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, was 100% contained. The blaze scorched 153,336 acres — an area larger than the city of Chicago. Widespread rains over the last couple of weeks brought relief to firefighters, but the wet, muddy conditions complicate efforts to locate human remains. Only 43 of the 85 remains have been positively identified to date. The other deadly wildfire in California, the Woolsey Fire on the outskirts of LA, is also 100% contained, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The Woolsey flames burned 96,949 acres and killed three people, bringing the combined death toll from both the Woolsey and Camp fires to 88 (not 91, as previously reported). This year to date, 7,989 fires have burned across California, fueled by hot, dry conditions and aggressive winds. The causes of the Woolsey and Camp Fires are still under investigation, but sparking power lines may have played a role in the Camp Fire. The Camp Fire moved at a deadly pace — about 80 football fields per minute — after breaking out on the morning of November 8. The 27,000-resident town of Paradise was in flames within hours. When President Donald Trump visited the wreckage in Paradise, California on November 17, he described the area as ""total devastation."" The fire's quick spread made successful evacuations nearly impossible. ""I was sitting in my car just screaming, waiting to die,"" Paradise resident Jackie Rabbit told INSIDER. She ditched her car and started running. She didn't even notice her bloody knee or injured ankle as she raced to safety. At least six people burned to death in their cars as they tried to escape, the Butte County Sheriff's Office said. ""The fire was so close I could feel it in my car through rolled-up windows,"" Rita Miller, who fled Paradise with her mother, told The Associated Press. Before this, California's deadliest blaze was a 1933 fire that broke out in LA's Griffith Park. It killed 29 laborers who were caught unprepared to battle the flames. The Camp Fire's death toll is almost triple that. More than 13,900 homes and 500 businesses were destroyed, along with over 4,200 other buildings, making the Camp Fire the most destructive wildfire in California's history in terms of structures lost. You can learn more about damage from the Camp Fire on Cal Fire's Structure Status Map and see evacuations on the Camp Fire Evacuation Map. Coroner search teams are still looking for victims in Paradise. After the fire receded from the Paradise area, more than 450 people were dispatched to look for human remains in the debris, according to the Associated Press. Abandoned cars in driveways were taken as a potential sign that residents might not have escaped. More than 800 volunteers spent their Thanksgiving holiday helping to look for victims, the AP reported. Sifting through the ashes, the teams sometimes recover only the partial remains of a victim to place in a body bag. ""The long bag looks almost empty as it's carefully carried out of the ruins and placed in a black hearse,"" the AP's Gillian Flaccus reported from Paradise. The Butte County Sheriff's office is working with anthropologists from California State University at Chico to help identify bone fragments among ash in the area. Some residents have given cheek swabs to help officials identify their relatives' remains. You can register yourself as safe or search for loved ones who are missing using the Red Cross' ""Safe and Well"" list online. Governor-elect Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Butte County the day the fire broke out and sent a letter to President Donald Trump and the Federal Emergency Management Agency asking for federal assistance. Trump approved some federal assistance for the California fires on November 9 and said on November 12 that he approved an ""expedited request for a Major Disaster Declaration,"" which allows people whose homes or workplaces were hit by the Woolsey or Camp Fires to apply for federal assistance. But on Twitter, Trump blamed the fires on poor forest management and threatened that there may be ""no more Fed payments."" (The federal government oversees more than 40% of California's land.) When visiting, Trump also criticized Californians for not doing more raking. ""I was watching the firemen the other day, and they were raking areas — they were raking areas where the fire was,"" Trump said on Fox News Sunday. ""That should have been all raked out and cleaned out,"" he added. ""You wouldn't have the fire."" Trump suggested that's how Finland prevents forest fires, but the president of Finland said it's not true. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a release that federal disaster assistance for the fire victims ""can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster."" Over $20 million in federal aid has been distributed so far, according to the agency, mostly in the form of hotel vouchers and other housing assistance. The aid is much needed among fire victims who lost everything. Troy Miller, a Butte County resident, was camping in a truck next to the remains of his house in Concow. ""I'm alive and I'm still up here,"" Miller told the Associated Press on November 19. ""There are plenty of other people worse off than I. I've got a lot of faith in God. I think things will be OK."" Smoke from the Camp Fire made it difficult for people in many parts of Northern California to breathe for nearly two weeks. Soot and chemicals released from the flames blanketed wide swaths of the state in a gray haze. In the days after the fires broke out, the Environmental Protection Agency described the air throughout much of the Bay Area as ""unhealthy"" or ""very unhealthy"" to breathe. Federal air monitors suggested that residents limit time outside and avoid outdoor exercise. San Francisco public schools shuttered their doors on November 16, and many museums opened their doors admission-free to help people find indoor activities. The San Francisco Air Quality Index, which measures the number of dangerously small pollutants in the air, is now back to normally healthy numbers. The US Department of the Interior estimates that the Camp and Woolsey Fires together ""produced emissions equivalent to roughly 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide."" The Woolsey Fire, fueled by fierce Santa Ana winds, destroyed 1,500 structures, mostly homes. The fire was marked as 100% contained on November 21. Three people died in the Woolsey Fire. Two burned bodies were found in a car in Malibu near Mulholland Highway, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said, while a third victim was discovered in the wreckage of a home in Agoura Hills. At its peak, the fire forced over 275,000 people from their homes. Carol Napoli, who lives at the Vallecito mobile-home park for seniors in Newbury Park, told the AP that the flames approached the park so fast that her mother didn't have time to grab her oxygen tank before they bolted in a car. ""We drove through flames to get out,"" Napoli said, adding: ""My girlfriend was driving. She said, 'I don't know if I can do this.' ... Her son said, 'Mom you have to — you have to drive through the flames.'"" The fire threatened mobile homes and mansions alike. Celebrities including Gerard Butler, Miley Cyrus, and Neil Young lost their houses. More than 80% of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, the country's largest urban national park, burned, according to the Los Angeles Times. Flames and smoke sent bobcats and mountain lions in the area scampering. The blaze also destroyed the storied filming location of Paramount Ranch, where the shows ""Westworld"" and ""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"" were shot. You can view find more information and resources on the Ventura County Emergency Information site, the Ventura County Recovers site, and LA County's Woolsey Fire site. Both the Woolsey Fire and another small fire, the Hill Fire, threatened the town of Thousand Oaks, where residents were already reeling from a mass shooting that left 12 people dead. A resident named Cynthia Ball told the AP it was ""like 'welcome to hell.'"" The LA County website says: ""If you are affected by the Woolsey or Hill fires, the Thousand Oaks mass shooting, or both, you can call the Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990 or text 'TalkWithUs' to 66746 for emotional support and resources."" The flames in Southern California have been fueled by hot, dry conditions and spread by Santa Ana winds, which tend to blow in from the desert in the fall months. Read more: Why wildfire season is getting longer and stronger As the LA Fire Department's Erik Scott pointed out on Twitter, some houses are better protected from fires than others, since green vegetation can help keep back flames. Wildfire season in California technically runs from late summer through the fall. But as the planet heats up, higher-than-average temperatures and drought conditions are becoming more common. Meanwhile, developers continue to build homes in places that are naturally prone to wildfires. ""Whether it is to allow a rock star to build on a ridgeline in Malibu or a manufactured-home community that nestles into the foothills, the decision is the same and the consequences are the same,"" Char Miller, the director of environmental analysis at Pomona College, told the Times. Fire officials in the state are now acknowledging that wildfires may not be limited to any specific season.

          / CBS/AP A sheriff's deputy who responded to the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California, last month was accidentally struck and killed by a bullet from a highway patrolman, police said Friday. Sgt. Ron Helus, 54, was also shot five times by the 28-year-old gunman, Ian Long, who took his own life, Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said. The November 7 massacre took place at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks. Eleven others died in the shooting. ""People were running through the parking lot and jumping out of windows to escape. Many were bleeding from injuries they received while escaping the bar. Shots could be heard as law enforcement officers bravely approached the front of the business,"" Ayub told reporters. When Helus and the patrolman entered the bar, he said, they were attacked by Long. They both retreated, firing their weapons, and Helus suffered the fatal gunshot wound. Officials didn't have much else to update about the investigation Friday, nothing more on the motive or the exact timeline of events — just the news that broke all their hearts, most of all that of the patrolman, a nine-year veteran, learned of the terrible mistake for the first time Thursday. Helus was wearing a bulletproof vest when he was shot, but officials did not say where the bullet entered his body. His wounds from Long's handgun were serious, but potentially survivable, including two that hit Helus on the edge of his vest, said Christopher Young, the county's chief medical examiner. Ayub said the finding that Helus was killed by another officer did not diminish their heroism. He said no one was to blame but the gunman himself. Helus was a 29-year veteran of the Ventura County Sheriff's Office and was planning to retire next year. He is survived by his wife and a 24-year-old son.

116,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/navy-times/news/your-navy/~3/mx10aHYY0VU/,"The Air Force could have prevented a former airman from buying a weapon and committing a mass shooting last year had investigators followed proper protocol, according to a Pentagon investigation of the incident released this week. The investigation casts doubt on the capabilities of Air Force Office of Special Investigations agents and the training of ordinary security forces airmen, according to the Defense Department Inspector General report, released Dec. 6. The findings, and a follow-up review across the DoD, could have implications across all the armed forces investigative arms. “We are currently conducting a follow-up review to assess the progress throughout the DoD in ensuring that all fingerprints required to be submitted to the FBI are in fact submitted,” DoD IG officials said. “This review will also assess whether DoD law enforcement agencies submit DNA to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System, as well as criminal history data, mental health information, and sex offender information, as required.” On Nov. 5, 2017, former airman Devin Kelley shot and killed 26 people and wounded 22 others at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas. After being shot by citizen responders, Kelley fled from the church in his vehicle and later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Kelley was able to purchase a firearm from a federally licensed dealer even though he had a disqualifying conviction. Kelley, who enlisted in 2010, served as a logistical readiness airman at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. In 2014, he was discharged from the Air Force after being convicted of assault. Because of that conviction, the Air Force should have sent his fingerprints and final disposition report to the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division. “If Kelley’s fingerprints were submitted to the FBI, he would have been prohibited from purchasing a firearm from a licensed firearms dealer,” DoD IG officials said in their 131-page report. The DoD IG conducted an investigation into Kelly’s actions to examine why the Air Force did not provide his fingerprints to the FBI, as was required. The office’s report found that the service had four different opportunities to submit the fingerprints, all of which they failed to do. AFOSI Special Agents failed to follow proper training and provided little reasoning behind why they did not submit the information, other than the large case-load being handled by their office, the turnover of staff and the inexperience of newer agents. “These factors provide context for the failures,"" investigators said. “However, they do not excuse the failures. The investigators and confinement personnel had a duty to know, and should have known, the DoD and USAF fingerprint policies, and should have followed them. The failures had drastic consequences and should not have occurred.” The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force said ""the failure in reporting Kelley’s criminal history was not an isolated event unique to this case or to Holloman Air Force Base where the investigation unfolded.” Lack of compliance with reporting requirements across the services was highlighted in multiple DoD IG audits that took place prior to the Texas shooting. Some corrective actions were implemented, but they were not timely or sufficient to achieve compliance across the force. Immediately following the mass shooting last year, the Air Force directed a review of all criminal history reporting requirements. This review, which was completed in late December 2017, generated 21 recommendations to correct deficiencies in criminal history reporting, 20 of which have already been completed, Air Force spokesman Ann Stefanek said in a statement. The remaining recommendation, primarily focused on enhancing efficiency, will be completed in July. The Air Force intends to correct all legacy case files going back to 1998, Stefanek added. The New Mexico flag waves in the breeze at the front gate of Holloman Air Force Base. Kelley was stationed here during his military service. (Airman 1st Class Deandre Curtiss/Air Force) The first opportunity to submit fingerprints occurred in 2011. Kelley had already failed out of tech school to become a network intelligence analyst, and was reclassified to be a traffic management apprentice. During this time, he married a former classmate with a son from a previous relationship. Kelley repeatedly hit his new stepson and wife. After the boy was hospitalized for various injuries, an investigation was initiated in June 2011. AFOSI Detachment 225, at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, conducted the investigation. This was the first opportunity to collect Kelley’s fingerprints. But Det. 225 leadership did not create a note in the investigative case file stating that the fingerprint card had been reviewed in accordance with AFOSI policy. As the investigation progressed, Kelley returned to work and repeatedly received letters of counseling and reprimand from leadership for his failure to attend training classes and for his use of a cellphone during duty hours, as well as verbal confrontations with superiors. The 49th Security Forces Squadron Office of Investigations conducted a subject interview with Kelley in February 2012 related to an assault on his wife, which violated Article 128 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Investigators wrote a report following the interview, which said Kelley must turn over a handgun he purchased at the Holloman base exchange to his acting first sergeant, who then turned it in to security forces. “This is the second opportunity to collect Kelley’s fingerprints,” the DoD IG report reads. Kelley continued to have problems at work, and with his UCMJ hearing approaching, he was ordered to confinement in June 2012. An AFOSI special agent conducts a fingerprint scan. Agents' failure to submit fingerprints to the FBI in the case of a mass shooter led to a DoD IG review of their policies. (Airman 1st Class Donald Knechtel/Air Force) (Airman 1st Class Donald Knechtel/28th Bomb Wing Public Affairs) Kelley’s commander prepared the pre-trial confinement package, which included a memorandum stating that the commander was convinced Kelley was “dangerous and likely to harm someone if released.” The commander also cited an internet search by Kelley for body armor and firearms as further justification for the pre-trial confinement. Kelley was identified as a flight risk and he was ordered into confinement at the 49th Security Forces Squadron confinement facility. In June 2012, AFOSI special agents conducted another interview with Kelley. The record from that encounter states that his fingerprints were collected, but there were no corresponding fingerprint cards in the case file, according to the DoD IG. “This is the third opportunity to collect Kelley’s fingerprints,"" DoD IG officials said. The final opportunity came in November 2012, when Kelley was convicted of assaulting his wife and her son during a general court-martial. He was reduced in rank to E-1, ordered into confinement for 12 months and given a bad conduct discharge. Kelley was confined to Holloman before transfer to a larger facility. Air Force Corrections System policy requires all post-trial inmates to have their fingerprints collected and submitted to the FBI during in-processing. However, there is no record of the confinement facility collecting or submitting Kelley’s fingerprints, according to the DoD IG. This was the fourth opportunity for the Air Force to collect Kelley’s fingerprints and the first opportunity to submit a final disposition report for his criminal history. In December 2012, AFOSI received an AF Form 1359, stating that Kelley’s conviction is a crime of domestic violence and requires DNA processing. Receipt of those forms also requires AFOSI to submit Kelley’s fingerprints and final disposition to the FBI, if not already submitted. Rachel Vasquez places flowers in a fence for the victims of the shooting outside of the Sutherland Springs Baptist Church following a service held at a temporary site on Nov. 12, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas. (Eric Gay/AP) (Eric Gay/AP) This was the second opportunity for the Air Force to submit the disposition of his conviction. But it did not occur, even though the special agent in charge of Det. 225 certified in the case management system checklist that Kelley’s fingerprints were submitted to the FBI. “We attempted to assess the environment in which these special agents and supervisors worked when they failed to collect and submit the fingerprints and final disposition reports,” DoD IG investigators said. ""We found several factors that created a challenging work environment. These factors included inexperienced special agents, individual personal issues at the time, leadership gaps, and a high operations tempo."" For example, the report said, five different special agents led AFOSI Det. 225 in the space of approximately four months; three of them were temporarily assigned for periods of roughly one to 10 weeks. In addition, four of the nine special agents assigned to Det. 225 were probationary agents with little to no experience in criminal investigations. These difficulties were compounded by the high operations tempo of the office, according to the report. Some agents told investigators that they received no formal training on submitting fingerprints, but the DoD IG found that to be untrue. “Six of the AFOSI Detachment 225 Special Agents told us that they received no formal training on the submission of fingerprints,” DoD IG investigators said. “Yet, we found that the AFOSI did have fingerprint submission training at the Criminal Investigator Training Program and AFOSI Basic Special Investigators Course.” Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church last year, told a military judge in 2012 that he ""would never allow myself to hurt someone"" again while confessing to violently hitting his stepson. (Texas Department of Public Safety) (AP) Meanwhile, the training program for Air Force security forces airmen did not include instruction on the collection and submission of fingerprints and final disposition information to the FBI. “In sum, we concluded that there was no valid reason for the [Air Force’s] failures to submit Kelley’s fingerprints and final disposition report to the FBI CJIS Division,” investigators said. The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force highlighted some of the corrective actions the service has undertaken in the wake of their own review late last year. In the near-term, AFOSI and Air Force security forces will disseminate updated guidance and conduct command-wide training on criminal history reporting guidelines and procedures, service leadership said in their statement. Commanders at all levels will also clearly articulate to airmen the need for total compliance and to assess local limitations, if any exist. When all corrective actions are implemented, the Air Force Audit Agency will conduct a review to ensure effectiveness. That audit will be completed Jan. 11, 2019, the service said. The Air Force is also in an ongoing process of sharing all lessons learned with the other services, service officials said in their statement. The DoD IG’s methodology for this investigation included a multi-disciplinary team of special agents, investigative specialists and attorneys. The Pentagon offices subpoenaed Kelley’s criminal history and mental health records, and the team conducted 41 witness interviews, including interviews of Kelley’s ex-wife, his second wife and his father.

Ron Helus, the hero officer who responded to the Thousand Oaks massacre, was killed by a friendly fire during shootout with the gun man Sgt. Ron Helus, the hero officer who lost his life while trying to save hundreds of others during the Thousand Oaks mass shooting last month, was killed by friendly fire. After being struck five times during a shootout at Borderline Bar & Grill with the gunman, who later took his own life, Helus, 54, was shot once more by a rifle from a California Highway Patrol officer, Sheriff Bill Ayub with the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department said in a news conference Friday. The bullet struck Helus in the chest and heart, ultimately killing him, Ayub explained. “Today I’m deeply saddened to inform you that Sgt. Helus was also struck by a sixth bullet, which we now know through forensic analysis from the FBI’s crime laboratory, was fired from the CHP officer’s rifle,” Ayub said in the news conference. “Tragically, that bullet struck vital organs, and was fatal.” At this time, police are still determining whether or not the friendly fire was “accidental, or a missighting, or perhaps a mistaken identity is something we’re still investigating.” Sgt. Helus and the CHP officer were the first on the scene and entered the bar around the same time. “When Ventura County Sheriff’s Sgt. Ron Helus and a CHP officer entered the bar, the suspect attacked almost immediately, firing multiple rounds at both men,” Ayub said. “Sgt. Helus was struck five times by gunfire from the suspect. Both men quickly retreated and fired their rifles at the suspect.” It was then that CHP officer, who has not been named, shot Helus. Helus later died at the hospital. CHP Coastal Division Chief L.D. Maples later explained in the news conference that the CHP officer, who he described as a “consummate professional” didn’t know he killed Helus and was informed Thursday. “It was a surprise to all of us. He was devastated,” Maples said. According to CBS Los Angeles, the CHP officer is on voluntary leave. Sgt. Helus was shot and killed along with 11 other people at the Boderline Bar & Grill on Nov. 7. He leaves behind his wife and their son Jordan. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Before entering the bar, Helus had been on the phone with his wife. “I love you, I’ll talk to you later,” he told her.

John Rich responds to fellow country stars’ new push for gun control NEW YORK – John Rich is challenging his fellow country music stars to a friendly debate over the Second Amendment. Rich, one half of the country duo Big & Rich, has never been one to shy away from politics. And when the ""Save A Horse, Ride A Cowboy"" singer heard his friends and fellow artists Dierks Bentley and Florida Georgia Line's Tyler Hubbard were part of a new push for gun control, the proud Texan was really interested to hear their side. ""Successful artists, while they're only one person, or a couple of people, whatever it is, they have millions of fans,"" the 44-year-old told Fox News exclusively. ""So when they speak, those millions of fans hear what they say."" Rich said he knows Bentley and Hubbard personally and has worked with them previously. He stressed that he has nothing but respect for them — but he does want to engage them in a conversation over the Second Amendment. ""The issue with gun control, you look at it and you go, 'These maniacs, these vicious people are taking a weapon and shooting people with it.' And then the flip side of that is, right now, I'm in New York City and back in Nashville is my wife and my two little kids,"" Rich said. ""And if somebody breaks into my house, which rifle would you suggest I tell my wife to grab? ""Which one should she grab? The one that gives her the best chance at protecting her and my kids or the one that doesn't?"" Rich asked fellow country music artists. ""Those are the types of questions I would like to ask them."" The country music community has faced questions regarding gun control after recent mass shootings affected its fans. In October 2017, a crazed gunman opened fire at the crowd of festivalgoers at the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas, taking the lives of 59 people. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. And in November of this year, a former Marine armed with a Glock 21 .45-caliber handgun with an illegal extended magazine opened fire on a packed California country music bar, killing 12 people, including a survivor of the Las Vegas festival shooting. Several country stars have spoken out since the tragic events – both for and against gun control – notably Erich Chruch, who was one of the headlining acts at the Route 91 Festival. Church told Rolling Stone in a wide-ranging July interview that, while he considers himself a ""Second Amendment guy,"" the National Rifle Association (NRA) is to blame for the mass shooting. Rich, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival shortly before shots rang out at the show, told Fox News shortly after the tragic event that he gave his weapon to an off-duty police officer who was at his Redneck Riviera bar as they heard news of the shooting. ""I had a Minneapolis police officer off-duty hanging out. He came up to me and he showed me his badge and he says, 'I'm an officer... and I am not armed for the first time ever I can't believe it. Are you armed? I said, 'Yes sir, I am armed.' I have my concealed weapons permit and I said, 'Yes, I am armed.' He said, 'Can I have your firearm so I can hold point on this front door?'"" Bentley and Hubbard's recent push includes asking for universal background checks and an effort to stop the ""gun show loophole."" They are asking for their fellow country artists to join their efforts. But Rich is standing firm about his views on guns, telling us it's ""only the bad guys [who] break the laws."" ""When I go buy a firearm, I register and do everything [by the book],"" he stressed. ""I have my firearm and my concealed weapons permit to defend myself."" He added, ""And so these artists that say that, by the way, I'm friends with all those guys...give us some kind of solution. What do you think we should do?""

124,https://www.denverpost.com/2018/12/08/red-panic-button-app-saves-colorado-teen-kidnapping/,"Trending: A cellphone panic button used Friday by a Grand Junction boy to escape from an alleged child molester is a key feature in a growing effort by the country’s school districts to more quickly alert police about mass shooting events. The Noonlight app — which users can get from the Google Play store and the AppStore — can be pushed and allows immediate contact with various emergency services, providing instant details of someone’s location. A similar cellphone alert system is now being used by 90 percent of public school districts in Long Island, N.Y.’s Suffolk County. At the push of a button, teachers and administrators call 911 and simultaneously alert other authorities about an active-shooter situation or emergency events, according to Newsday. The panic button also provides up-to-date information that first responders may need, such as the layout of a school building. Unlike a traditional emergency call, the RAVE smartphone alert used in Long Island does not go through a call log where other emergency calls are fielded. Instead, it is given its own call log and police are dispatched immediately. A panic button app also has been installed in teacher cellphones in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and California. It’s not clear if cellphone panic buttons are being used in Colorado schools. Grand Junction police said Thursday night they were alerted when a panic alarm was used on a cellphone in the 600 block of 26 Road. When they arrived, they found the boy in the back seat of a car and a man in the front trying to start the vehicle. The victim told police that he met a person he thought was a 13- or 14-year-old boy on a social media application called “Kik.” After communicating for several days, the person messaged him and said he was in town and wanting to meet him. They agreed on a location to meet, and when the victim walked to the location, 47-year-old Aaron Scott Smith of Utah allegedly drove up to him, called the boy by name and told him to get in the car, police said. The boy got into the car and immediately activated an emergency alarm on his cellphone. About 13 minutes later, police — guided by the cellphone signal — arrived at the scene. Smith has been arrested for investigation of kidnapping, internet luring of a child, child enticement, sexual assault on a child, unlawful sexual contact with consent, obstructing a police officer and having vehicle license plates that are not clearly visible, police said. Smith molested a 13-year-old paper carrier he supervised and was sentenced to up to five years in prison, according to the the Deseret News in Salt Lake City.

The shooting was reported at 7:45 p.m. Friday in the 5100 block of Tujunga Avenue, near Magnolia Boulevard, according to Officer Drake Madison of the Los Angeles Police Department’s Media Relations Section. “We got information from… witnesses that apparently this started at a fast-food restaurant not too far away from here, possibly the Taco Bell,” LAPD Detective Sgt. Adolfo Godinez told reporters at the scene. The car crashed into a sign outside the East Valley Family YMCA at 5142 Tujunga Ave. Madison said when the call came in, one victim was reported to be inside the YMCA and the other in the car. A witness at the scene told ABC7 he saw the man inside the building. “He said ‘please help me, somebody call the police, I don’t want to die,’ ” the witness, identified as David, said. “He was running all over and the whole hallway was full of blood.” The man and woman were taken to a hospital for treatment, police said. “He is not in a condition to speak, so he’s not giving too much information,” Godinez said. “Not saying that he’s withholding information, just saying he’s not able to speak right now. The female as well.” The woman reported that she had been shot in a leg, Madison said. A red BMW may have been involved in the shooting, but that has not been confirmed, Madison said.

One equally surefire way to sort-circuit this useful dynamic is to turn on the immigrant spigot every time some group’s wages go up.” Which leads to another question:  Posted at  by Ed Driscoll on Feb 28, 2021 at 8:14 am Link NEWSPAPERS ARE AN EXCELLENT WAY TO TRANSFORM A LARGE FORTUNE INTO A SMALL ONE: Los Angeles Times Owner Exploring Sale of Company. Billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong is exploring a sale of the Los Angeles Times less than three years after buying it for $500 million, people familiar with the matter said. The move marks an abrupt about-face for Mr. Soon-Shiong, who had vowed to restore stability to the West Coast news institution and has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into the paper in an effort to turn it around. When Mr. Soon-Shiong acquired the Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune and a handful of weeklies from Tribune Publishing Co.  TPCO +0.00%  , then called Tronc Inc., in 2018, it was met with great fanfare from staff and media watchers after years of turmoil and downsizing at the publications. At the time, he said that the sale represented the beginning of a new era and that he intended to do what it took to make the business viable for the next 100 years. He has since grown dissatisfied with the news organization’s slow expansion of its digital audience and its substantial losses, the people said. He also has increasingly come to believe that the Los Angeles Times and San Diego Union-Tribune—together known as the California Times company—would be better served if they were part of a larger media group, they said. The new owner of the L.A. Times might want to consult with Mickey Kaus, who explained over a decade ago why the paper was doomed. Posted at  by Ed Driscoll on Feb 20, 2021 at 8:14 am Link MICKEY KAUS:  Woke Health Care Should Terrify Liberals: You may have assumed that woke activism was a sideshow, destroying academic institutions and The New York Times. Yet here it had pentrated an important, once-revered government scientific agency and it was affecting, not who gets to edit the Times op-ed page but basic questions of life and death for millions. For liberals, this should be especially terrifying–most crucially for backers of “Medicare for All” and other ambitious health plans. I think I’m one of them — I’ve always supported some kind of universal, national health insurance. Medicare seems like a program that works–why not expand it? Claims from conservatives that this gives government too much power have always seemed like a rote application of abstract dogma. Did Medicare — run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — have too much power?  Hard to see how. There’s no obvious rationing. No death panels. Of course there are always worries about cost-cutting, and the insidious culture of “good death,” including creepy end-of-life maneuvers (like the UKs infamous Liverpool Pathway). Yet we could seemingly rely on voter demand for care to overhwelm lugubrious proponents of medical austerity. But what happened last week was not abstract: The near-hijacking of a universal medical instiution, and a potential denial of care, not in the name of budget-cutting but in the name of two-wrongs-make-up-for-racism social justice. Fight it and you’re not just self-interested and wrong. You’re self-interested and wrong and racist. Where’ll this line of argument crop up next? Do I have to worry that in the future, when I’m wheeled into the ER, some Ivy League bioethicist will have decided I’m too white to get care? Or — further up the medical supply chain — that valuable medicines won’t even be developed because’If the government paid for this procedure it would save lives, but they would not be diverse lives …’ If you thought Woke CDC was bad, wait till you see Woke CMS. I’ll stick with Blue Cross, thanks. Yes, I’m quite paranoid about this, for good reasons. Put crudely, our colleges have been churning out these Woke folk for many years now. They’ve infiltrated themselves into every institution of society — including the state, apparently– where they reward each other with tenure and civil service protections. They’ll be hard to root out! You can’t fire a civil servant without months, or years, of due process. Even then you can’t fire them just because their loony views clash with the policies endorsed by the voters.  That would violate the First Amendment! (See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347). Now I know how Joe McCarthy felt. Actuallly, the Woke have a weapon that 50’s Communists never did — the power of cancellation, which works in some contexts at least, including agencies that are terrified of even a day’s bad PR. (Ask Shirley Sherrod.) And if Wokeness gained power under Trump, what about under a Democrat? Here is Biden’s historic opportunity to perform a service for his party. If you’re a Big Government liberal, you want to strangle the Woke baby in the bathtub, before it grows up to thoroughly undermine public support for finishing the great Democratic project (including universal health care, but also ending exclusionary zoning and stratified schooling, providing a safe environment, etc.). Biden’s not ‘the perfect man for the job’–that would be 1992’s Bill Clinton. (Ask Sister Souljah.)  But Biden’s a solid candidate. Good luck with that.  I’m not sure he’s even got solid poops these days. Posted at  by Glenn Reynolds on Dec 30, 2020 at 7:24 am Link MICKEY KAUS:  Andrew’s Landslide:  The internal contradictions of Sullivanism. Sullivan seems to entirely blame Trump for “tribalism” and “polarization,” which is why Trump needs to be expunged and cauterized etc.. Trump certainly hasn’t cured those problems — or even tried — but given the Democrats’ inability to come to terms with his 2016 victory, their immediate full-on opposition, their ongoing attempts to reverse the election’s result— plus the pre-Trump ascendance of Critical Race Theory (critqued most accessibly by Sullivan himself) and the eruption of Black Lives Matter protests (against police brutality, not Trump’s policies), it seems as if at least some percentage of the blame should fall on Democrats who’d feel vindicated by a landslide. Indeed, a Dem landslide — or any Dem win at all — will encourage more of the deeply antisocial behavior we’ve seen over the past four years. One other thought:  People seem to think that if the Dems win, Trump will go away.  But why should he?  He can continue as a thorn in the side of the new administration, with a huge megaphone, deep pockets, and a large — and post-election, angry — following.  Twitter will probably kick him off, but then he can start his own social media network, and possibly his own television network now that Fox is going wobbly.  And Trump will be the center of attention, overshadowing the Harris/Biden administration almost from day one. Meanwhile, read all of Mickey’s post.  I love it when he writes long-form.

Posted at  by Glenn Reynolds on Jun 02, 2019 at 8:46 pm Link TWEETS FROM THE UNDERGROUND: To get a sense of how social media shapes — and sometimes upends society, note the progression of this story involving superstar actor Will Smith. Yesterday, at Ricochet,  Bethany Mandel noted that “The Woke Always Eat Their Own,” linking to an item that was promoted to the top of Twitter by their management concerning SJWs grousing about Smith being cast to play Serena and Venus Williams’ father in an upcoming biopic, because “some people [were] questioning the decision for Smith to play a darker-skinned man.” As Mandel adds: When you click on the story, the objections appear to just be from a handful accounts, and none of them notable. That hasn’t stopped Twitter from elevating their complaints to the mainstream, granting them undeserved legitimacy. The purpose is for clicks, for engagement, for conversation on Twitter about the topic. It’s their business model, and you can’t fault them for trying to initiate a conversation. The problem is, Twitter (and its ultra-liberal Silicon Valley engineers) are willing to let the enemy of the good be the enemy of the perfect; stoking race wars within the black community in order to do it. Twitter is the spawning place for lots of what Mickey Kaus calls “the undernews,” much of which never is touched by the MSM. But how quickly did this non-story emerge from the undernews to the overculture? This fast, as spotted by Power Line’s Steve Hayward today: You might think this was limited to the crazed Twitterati, but in fact the “controversy” made it to the BBC, which demonstrates once again the “Beebs” atrocious news judgment: Will Smith ‘casting as Richard Williams’ sparks colourism debate Richard Williams, 77, coached his daughters to become two of the world’s greatest tennis players, despite having no previous experience of the game. But Smith’s reported casting in the film has angered critics, who say he is too light-skinned for the part. Colourism is a form of discrimination against dark-skinned people in favour of those with lighter skin from the same race. “As someone pointed out in the aftermath of Jussie Smollett hoax,” Hayward writes, “the demand for racism now exceeds the supply, so we have to resort to made-up racism to satisfy the demand for leftists to feel outraged and indignant.” Obviously though, there’s a simple solution to this dust-up. There’s only person qualified to play the pater familias of the Williams family: Scarlett Johansson. Posted at  by Ed Driscoll on Mar 06, 2019 at 10:00 pm Link SO ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT TRUMP’S SPEECH LAST NIGHT is how it seemed calculated to demolish all the standard anti-Trump tropes from the media and from the left and to do so with compelling imagery.  Consider: Trump’s a Nazi:  Praise for Holocaust survivors, and a touching rendition of “Happy Birthday.”  (With Trump waving his fingers like a conductor). Trump hates minorities:  Brags about record low black, Hispanic, and Asian unemployment — while white-clad Democratic women, overwhelmingly white themselves, sat prune-faced. Trump’s a Russian tool:  Withdrawing from the INF Treaty. Trump’s a warmonger:  Without me, Trump says, we’d be at war on the Korean peninsula.  Also, I’m looking at pulling out of Afghanistan. Trump hates women:  Except he got even the prune-faced white-clad Democratic women up dancing (and chanting “USA! USA!”) when he talked about record female employment in and out of Congress. And his rebuke to socialism was designed to strip the glamour that the media have tried to imbue it with by tying it to the abject misery of Venezuela. In debate, I think this is called cutting across your opponent’s flow.  And I think it’s Trump’s opening shot at 2020, as well as an effort to undercut the “Resistance” in and out of Congress.  Plus, as Ann Althouse notes, despite the predictions of lefties like Robert Reich (see below) it was all wrapped in optimism and sunny American exceptionalism.  Genuinely Reaganesque. And, of course, the sour, shallow responses from the lefty apparat just underscore that:   But outside the apparat, it played well even with a lot of people who didn’t vote for Trump:  Ouch, indeed:  UPDATE:  I remember when Robert Costa was supposed to be a conservative:  Posted at  by Glenn Reynolds on Feb 06, 2019 at 8:03 am Link ANDREW SULLIVAN:  Trump’s right to want to pull out of Syria and Afghanistan, and the establishment is corrupt and crazy to oppose him.

Including this: Two weeks before the Alabama election, some polls apparently showed a very tight race. About this time, Trump held his infamous dinner with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi at which he seemed to cut a Dem-friendly deal to give amnesty to the “Dreamers” — in exchange for a grab-bag of feel-good border security measures that did not include his promised Wall. Candidate Moore denounced the deal. Strange wouldn’t commit. Moore soon opened up a lead that doesn’t seem to have been cut even by Trump’s appearance in Huntsville on Strange’s behalf. I’m not saying there weren’t other big factors in the race, like anger at the GOP’s failure to repeal Obamacare. I’m saying the seemingly impending Trump-endorsed Dreamer cave-in was another big factor. The difference between the two factors is that the mainstream press, which instinctively avoids crediting restrictionist concerns, will tell you about the former but not the latter. And the Alabama revolt will make a difference in the eventual legislative outcome. Remember  when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s defeat by an anti-amnesty outsider in 2014 sealed the doom of the massive, heavily hyped “Gang of 8” amnesty? The bill had already passed the Senate, but when Cantor went down House Republicans who valued their job security didn’t want to go anywhere near it. Luther Strange is Cantor II. Which House Republicans want to try out for the role of Cantor III by backing the Pelosi/Trump amnesty? Not many, I suspect. The pundits may tell them the Alabama race was all about vague anti-Establishment anger, or the failure to repeal Obamacare, or about “local dynamics.” Elected Republican legislators, with their careers on the line, know better. We’ll see how bright they turn out to be. Posted at  by Glenn Reynolds on Sep 27, 2017 at 12:00 pm Link MICKEY KAUS: Don’t buy all the PR-style hooey about ‘dreamers.’ Compared with the general population, dreamers are not especially highly skilled. A recent survey for several pro-dreamer groups, with participants recruited by those groups, found that while most dreamers are not in school, the vast majority work. But their median hourly wage is only $15.34, meaning that many are competing with hard-pressed lower-skilled Americans. The dreamers you read about have typically been carefully selected for their appeal. They’re valedictorians. They’re first responders. They’re curing diseases. They root for the Yankees. They want to serve in the Army. If dreamers are the poster children for the much larger undocumented population, these are the poster children for the poster children. Still, taking the dreamers as a whole, not just the dreamiest of them, they represent an appealing group of would-be citizens. So why not show compassion and legalize them? Because, as is often the case, the pursuit of pure compassion comes with harmful side effects. Plus: Under “chain migration” rules established in 1965 — ironically as a sop to conservatives, who foolishly thought that they’d boost European inflows — new citizens can bring in their siblings and adult children, who can bring in their siblings and in-laws, until whole villages have moved to the United States. That means today’s 690,000 dreamers would quickly become millions of newcomers, who may well be low-skilled and who would almost certainly include the parents who brought them — the ones who, in theory, are at fault.

We’re supposed to draw up sides — condemning (and ostracizing) those who are “complicit” in Trump’s administration and welcoming those who “stand on the right side of history” — even before we know whether the authoritarian seed will grow or wither, disregarding all the other positively auspicious seeds (reform of trade, control of borders, fewer foreign miliary adventures,  ending the Republican threat to Social Security and Medicare, etc.) that might flourish instead.

Not least of which was Time magazine’s infamous cover of Obama Photoshopped into the second coming of FDR and the headline “The New, New Deal,” thinking it was a compliment, and not an ominous prediction of an economy as similarly atrophied as Roosevelt’s. Pretending that Trump is Hitler allows you, oh brave foot-soldier in the DNC-MSM, to pose as the new Dietrich Bonhoeffer. It’s simply the funhouse mirror image version of the same sclerotic meme. For the modern left, if the economy is relatively good*, and the incoming president has a (D) after his name, he’s the second coming of JFK (see: Clinton, Bill); if the economy is bad, and he has a (D) after his name, he’s FDR — and no matter what the shape of the economy, if the president has an (R) after his name, he’s Hitler (QED: Nixon, Reagan, Bush #43, and Trump). * And it was, despite Clinton’s rhetoric.

The rise of the Blogosphere during the immediate aftermath of 9/11 was something to behold – the best analogy that I can think of is to compare it to the golden age of television in the 1950s: a new medium was born, and for those willing to seek it out, programming of a surprisingly high quality was available to be consumed on it. But unlike television, which then as now requires an army of craftsmen and technicians to create, the early Blogosphere was almost exclusively a series of solo acts, and living in California, from about 9:00 PM to midnight Pacific Time each weeknight, I would eagerly consume the best of the new programming as it went online, usually (forgive me If my memory of the timing is a bit off) Den Beste around 7:00 or 8:00 PM, Lileks around 9:00 or ten o’clock, and then pre-Weimar era Andrew Sullivan around 11 or midnight. And of course, Glenn firing off new posts throughout the night. Den Beste also demonstrated how infinitely flexible blogging could be. Glenn, Mickey Kaus, Sullivan and Virginia Postrel specialized in short posts offering news aggregation and commentary, but Den Beste seemed to effortlessly generate 1,500 to 3,000 word essays on the GWOT and other breaking news events every night. Of course, they only looked effortless to those of us reading them. I imagine the work that went into them eventually contributed to Den Beste’s health issues, and the merciless brickbats he received from the tolerance and diversity-obsessed left eventually led him to focus his blogging primarily on anime and other lighter fare. As with the Golden Age of TV, which by the early ‘60s had collapsed into Newton Minnow’s infamous “vast wasteland…of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, western bad men, western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons. And endlessly commercials,” the Golden Era of the Blogosphere was doomed to be a fleeting epoch as well. Today, blogging is universal, but also far too corporatist, an increasingly exclusive medium for Democrat operatives with bylines to pay homage to the state. But for a time, there were a plethora of individual voices to be read, and Den Beste’s was one of the most idiosyncratic and enjoyable. “A software engineer by trade, exhibiting a precise logic in his thinking, Den Beste was acerbic, sharp and often charmingly irascible,” Jim Geraghty writes today in encomium. “I missed his playful cantankerousness when he had merely stopped blogging. He’s missed even more now.” RIP. UPDATE: In his tribute to Den Beste, Ace of Spades compares the heyday of the USS Clueless as belonging to “a pre-professional blogging age (such as it may well be), a novice/hobbyist phase, when writers would just write about whatever interested them at that moment, whether it ‘fit the format’ or whatever. Rather like I’ve heard FM radio was when it first came out, as opposed to heavily-programmed/demographically-targeted AM.” Given the free-form, inventing techniques and terminology on the fly nature of the early Blogosphere, that’s an apt comparison as well.

For months, liberals inside and outside of the press denounced Trump’s immigration views, accusing him of being a bigot, etc. But immigration has now disappeared from the news. In the first Clinton-Trump debate, moderator Leslie Holt never mentioned the subject. Why? Democrats understand that most voters side with Trump. Likewise with trade. Here, in my opinion, Trump is vulnerable, but the issue is still too risky for the Left. Therefore, the less said the better. How about our declining military, the Iran deal, Hillary Clinton’s criminal mishandling of classified information, the weakest recovery since WWII, stagnant wages, the war on cops and a suddenly rising crime rate, the Libya fiasco, and Obamacare, a failure by any accounting? Where have all the issues gone? Off the front pages, every one, and so far, out of the debates. The issues that voters care most about appear to be off the table until the election is safely over. Instead, editors and reporters are feeding us a steady diet of Trump’s tax returns, a reprise of birtherism, and Alicia Machado, a person, evidently, of great significance. You could say she is the Quemoy and Matsu of this election, but that understates the case. It is obvious what is going on here. Trump can push back on that, but he tends to be reactive.

But I’m also pro-reality, and that means also reporting bad news when it breaks, such as bad poll numbers for Trump or something goofy he’s uttered. Back in late 2003, a year and a half after Ed Driscoll.com had launched, I linked to a Mickey Kaus quote on the then-recently invented phrase “Liberal cocooning.” As Mickey wrote: Reporters and editors at papers like the Times (either one!) are exquisitely sensitive to any sign that Democrats might win, but don’t cultivate equivalent sensitivity when it comes to discerning signs Republicans might win. (Who wants to read that?) The result, in recent years, is the Liberal Cocoon, in which Democratic partisans are kept happy and hopeful until they are slaughtered every other November. Having seen the GOP fail to cross the finish line in 2008 and 2012, I have no desire to write the conservative/libertarian equivalent of that sort of reader cocooning. But if you’ve been a long time reader of mine, it should be obvious that whatever my concerns about Trump’s flaws, the fact that he’s not Hillary Clinton* – and has thoroughly driven her palace guard DNC-MSM insane — is enough for me to vote for him.

I mean, Kaus was writing about this in 2001, but has the lesson sunk in?  No.  Wrote Mickey: In fact, there’s a good argument that “welfare benefits + ethnic antagonism” is the universal recipe for an underclass with an angry, oppositional culture. The social logic is simple: Ethnic differences make it easy for those outside of, for example, French Arab neighborhoods to discriminate against those inside, and easy for those inside to resent the mainstream culture around them. Meanwhile, relatively generous welfare benefits enable those in the ethnic ghetto to stay there, stay unemployed, and seethe. Without government subsidies, they would have to overcome the prejudice against them and integrate into the mainstream working culture. Work, in this sense, is anti-terrorist medicine. (And if you work all day, there’s less time to dream up ways and reasons to kill infidels.) Still true, still an important consideration for policy.  Still ignored. Posted at  by Glenn Reynolds on Aug 16, 2016 at 10:24 pm Link MICKEY KAUS: “My theory: MSM terrified Orlando attack will produce Trump lead. All hands on deck. Old rules No Longer Apply. We’ll show him.” He’s very likely right, but I’m not sure about the “old rules apply” part, as the MSM pounding Trump is simply a continuation of a long playbook. During the height of the MSM’s zaniest conspiracy theory dissembling during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Mickey wrote, “Previously, [the media] couldn’t grouse about the Iraq War without seeming defeatist (and anti-liberationist and maybe even selfishly isolationist). Even the Clintons never figured a way out of that trap…Katrina gives [the MSM] a way to talk about Iraq without talking about Iraq. No wonder Gwen Ifill smiles the ‘inner smile.’” Such demagoguery produced results, as Bryan Preston wrote in November of 2006 at Hot Air. “What cost the GOP its majorities in Congress and statehouses?… The GOP’s fortunes fatally cratered in the Fall of 2005, and were recovering ever since minus a couple of blips this year. What happened in the Fall of ‘05? Katrina. That storm turned out to be the hurricane that changed history:” There’s a lesson in all of this, that’s an old one but an important one to remember: Demagoguery wins, and more so when it comes in the middle of a horrific disaster. Also, lies do indeed travel halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on. By the time the story of New Orleans buses surfaced (only to be buried by the AP and ignored by the national media), the disaster had been framed as a Bush failure and the damage was already done. The media’s later mea culpa did nothing to change the basic narrative that already had a life of its own. Years later, DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile would later confess, “Bush came through on Katrina,” but as a wise future mayor would advise in the fall of 2008, “Never let a crisis go to waste.” And speaking of 2008, it was that year that the media went all-in to elect Obama, ceding their pose as “objective” journalists in order to consummate their “Slobbering Love Affair” with the man they made president, to borrow from Bernie Goldberg’s classic title. But it’s always been just a pose. On Tuesday, CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert “slammed Donald Trump on Tuesday’s episode of The Late Show, drawing a swastika to explain the presumed Republican presidential nominee’s response to the Orlando, Florida mass shooting on Sunday,” Entertainment Weekly notes. The old rules at CBS certainly apply here — comparing the Republican nominee to a Nazi has a long and storied pedigree at the “Tiffany Network.” Just ask the ghosts of Walter Cronkite and Daniel Schorr, who dished out the same treatment – on the CBS Evening News no less, not the network’s late night gab fest and comedy show – to Barry Goldwater in 1964. There’s no doubt the media viscerally loathes Trump — in large part because Trump isn’t afraid to get in their faces and punch back twice as a hard, as a wise community organizer would advise. But they’d be battering any presidential candidate with an (R) after his name right around this time. The old rules are very much in force.

That will force voters to learn what is like to live with each of the candidates, and weigh their flaws and virtues with special thoroughness. Hell, by September it will seem as if Trump’s already been president for a year. That means attacking him over last fall’s insults may not work — after all, they will have been a looong time ago, and now we’ll know the guy.

Vegan Restaurant Owners Receiving Death Threats for Slaughtering Animals: “People have taken up the mob mentality,” says Matthew. “It saddens me that the choices we made in the privacy of our home would lead people to feel so betrayed that it’s elevated to threats on our lives. I’m very discouraged.” The trouble began last week when animal rights activists discovered and then widely circulated a 14-month-old blog post written by Terces on the Engelharts’ Be Love Farm website, which mixed an announcement of their transition back into a meat diet again after nearly 40 years of vegetarianism (they had been vegan since 2003) with posted pictures of strained beef broth and a freezer full of pastured beef from their own dairy cows. Matthew tells THR they have kept chickens on the farm for seven years “for eggs only,” along with the cows for five years for milk, cheese and butter that’s for sale. (He claims they’ve “harvested,” or slaughtered, several cows in total and never sold the meat, only shared it with “our friends, neighbors and community.”) The news has come as a shock to many vegans, who have been regular customers of the restaurants and claim the Engelharts have built their brand on not just serving vegan food but clearly wrapping themselves in the righteousness of the vegan cause — which they argue has now been undermined. “The reason we’re so upset is that veganism is a belief system,” says Carrie Christianson, who started the Facebook boycott group. “You are patronizing a restaurant that you think has that philosophy, and it turns out it doesn’t. Vegans should know that this restaurant has a farm that slaughters animals.” That’s the key line in this article: “The reason we’re so upset is that veganism is a belief system” — in other words, like radical environmentalism and radical feminism, veganism is one of many alternate religions that are subsets of the holistic New Age Left. (Nietzsche killed God, but man is hardwired to believe in a cause higher than himself. When traditional religion is rejected, the odds are pretty good that something cultish will be chosen to replace it.) The restaurant owners chose to cater to them, apparently without pondering the jihad they would face if and when they were discovered to be apostates by their core customers. Or as a wise social critic once described the nihilistic alternative lifestyles of California, “You can checkout anytime you like, but you can never leave.” Related: Speaking of alternate religions, as Ace writes, “I am indebted to Christina Hoff Sommers for pointing out that every identity politics cult is just a conspiracy theory with a racial (or gender) edge.” (Via Mickey Kaus.) Posted at  by Ed Driscoll on May 03, 2016 at 8:51 am Link SEAN TRENDE ON TRUMP, ELITE DISDAIN, AND AUTHENTICITY: Trump’s support is also concentrated in counties with high levels of unemployment, high numbers of voters with a high school diploma and nothing more, and low housing values. These are the people that globalization left behind, who fifty years ago would have had decent paying jobs in factories or even performing manual labor, and who could hope that their children would have the same. Instead they see their towns characterized by vacant buildings, drug problems, and government dependence. But it goes well beyond economic issues. What drives this quest for “authentic” candidates is also cultural.  I would ask my readers to consider: How many people who staunchly oppose gay marriage do you know? How many people who are “pure” creationists – who believe that God created the world largely “as-is” – are in your circle of friends? I would guess that for a large number of readers, the answer is quite close to “none.” Yet these are not obscure viewpoints; in fact, the “pure” evolutionary viewpoint is a minority view in America. The odds of having no one with these views in your circle of friends are, literally, astronomically small. We’ve self-segregated as a society, and people who adhere to what we might call a cosmopolitan worldview or morality system increasingly fail to interact with people who view the world differently. As a result, cultural traditionalists have been otherized. Cosmopolitans also happen to occupy the commanding heights of American culture, and they’ve become increasingly aggressive in promoting what one of my friends called a “sneering disdain” for traditionalists—an attitude I myself sometimes struggle to keep in check.  So it is unsurprising that when the RAND Corporation recently polled candidates’ supporters, “people like me don’t have any say” was the strongest indicator of support for Trump, beyond education, beyond income, and beyond antipathy toward Muslims and Hispanics. To bring this back around to populism, when people see the genteel politician in a crisp suit talking about the long term economic benefits of immigration and trade, they look around their neighborhoods and see a detachment from reality. They also – and I would say this is of equal importance – see someone who likely looks down his nose at them and believes he is better than them. So when people look at Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders, with their heavy accents and awkward hairstyles, they see themselves (sure Donald Trump was born wealthy, but he has a distinct nouveau riche affect; he can hardly be described as patrician). And when people mock them for their hair or their straightforward manner of speech, it channels every cultural slight these voters have faced in the past decade. Sadly, this is unlikely to get better before it gets worse; this growing cultural divide shows no signs of abating. This also goes to the things that Mickey Kaus has written about social vs. economic inequality.  Elites are happy to condemn economic inequality, but they pretty much like social inequality the way it is.

At Red State, Moe Lane responds, “Shocker: 2008 Obama supporter thinks democracy doesn’t work!” It never fails. You get some ostensibly well-meaning, but ultimately self-deluding guy (in this case, Bernie Quigley) who in 2008 declares Barack Obama to be the ” New JFK” who shows “organizational and conceptual abilities already that are superior to any candidate in our time.”  And, not least because of people like Mr. Quigley, Barack Obama gets elected – and then proceeds to demonstrate an appalling lack of organizational and conceptual abilities, to the point where the Democratic party outside of the executive branch now looks like a minor, regional party that is one bad cycle away from losing the East Coast*.  And, oh, yeah: the country’s foreign policy is in worse shape than ever, and things aren’t really improving.  One would think that this might suggest to people like Mr. Quigley that maybe, just maybe, he backed the wrong horse in 2008…. HAHAHAHA! Nah, it just tells him that the country’s ungovernable: “Late in life, the great Amb. George Kennan declared that America needed a “council of elders” to contain the excesses of democracy. The governors, perhaps meeting in a selective and representative regional council, like a board of trustees at a university or a board of directors of a corporation, might offer America saving grace at a time of dangerous crossing.”  Because the problem’s not Barack Obama, you see. It’s democracy itself. As Moe adds, Quigley “is one of the guys who can apparently write ‘the nefarious triumvirate of Dick Cheney, Karl Rove and especially George W. Bush’ with a straight face, and apparently no sense of shame.” Back in 2012, Quigley wrote that Elizabeth Warren’s “claim to be ‘part Indian’ is correct in mythical terms…In the heartland it is almost universal for those who have been there for a few generations to claim Indian blood; that is, to wish it were there even if it isn’t. It is not so much a lie as it is the acculturation of personal and regional American myth; the fabric of old-soul American consciousness.” Rachel Dolezal, call your office. You too, Dan Rather! But regarding “the council of elders,” at the beginning of 2010, when Scott Brown was sent to the Senate by Massachusetts voters with the hope that he would save America from the debacle of Obamacare, Mickey Kaus wrote, “I’d guess we’re about 36 hours away from a Beltway call for ‘wise men,'” the first of several from pundits hoping to save Obama from himself. But unlike Lyndon Johnson, who met with the New Deal-era Democrat grandees dubbed “the Wise Men” in late 1967 and again in March of 1968, the latter meeting occurring shortly before Johnson concluded that Vietnam — and his presidency — both appeared lost, why would Obama listen to Quigley’s “council of elders?” After all, he professes to believe that “I’m a better speechwriter than my speechwriters. I know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors. And I’ll tell you right now that I’m gonna think I’m a better political director than my political director.” Between the race riots, the campus riots, the massive expansion of the federal government and the concurrent belief in its infallibility, the military debacles overseas, a feeling in general that the nation was out of control and now this latest call for the wise men to bail him out, it really does feel like we’re living out the last year of the Johnson administration, doesn’t it?

BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO ANGER THEM, Jim Geraghty writes: Another big reason Republicans are angry is because they have a president who embraces a political strategy of deliberately and consistently enraging conservatives. Major Garrett detailed the White House’s calculated effort to be controversial and provocative in 2014: This is the White House theory of “Stray Voltage.” It is the brainchild of former White House Senior Adviser David Plouffe, whose methods loom large long after his departure. The theory goes like this: Controversy sparks attention, attention provokes conversation, and conversation embeds previously unknown or marginalized ideas in the public consciousness. Mickey Kaus characterizes the approach as “gaslighting” — giving your opponent a legitimate reason to get angry, then turning around and pointing to their anger as evidence they’re unhinged, obsessed, incapable of governing responsibly, et cetera. President Obama made clear he refuses to be a lame duck; instead, the passage of the 2014 midterms only liberated him from worrying about what the public thinks. * * * * * * * Many Republicans feel hated by their president, and they return the sentiment. Whether or not they believe in Obama’s Hawaiian birth, they increasingly agree with Rudy Giuliani’s sentiment, “[Obama] doesn’t love you. And he doesn’t love me. He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.” In Trump, these voters finally have a candidate who expresses that disdain as directly and passionately as they feel it. Time will tell whether the Obama strategy of relentless provocation worked by driving the GOP to extreme antagonism that repelled a majority of the electorate — or whether he will have just riled up his opposition to the state of victorious determination.

But that’s not going to happen. As best, the fight for eventual nomination will be a long slog, with Clinton in the role of piñata. As sharks are drawn to blood in the water, Hillary’s miseries are attracting other candidates. The latest is Joe Biden. There is much that is admirable in Biden; but if anyone will be a weaker candidate than a wounded Clinton, it has to be Biden. The man will be 74 years old on Election Day. That’s five years older than Ronald Reagan was at the time of his first election, and Reagan’s age was a liability in the campaign. Clinton, like Reagan will be 69 — youthful next to Biden. Worse, Biden has proven himself on two occasions, 1988 and 2008, to be a dreadful presidential candidate. He has been a competent vice president, but that is no reason to think that he will be a more effective candidate now than in his previous outings. But he could well draw off enough of the anybody-but-Hillary support to make the nomination quest even more of an ordeal. And if Biden gets in, others may. Well-placed sources say John Kerry is tempted. He’s been a surprisingly good secretary of state. But he blew a very winnable election in 2004. Like Biden, he’s a better public official than a candidate.* Can you imagine the geriatric Democratic field? Sanders and Biden at 74, maybe Kerry at 73, and the young sprite of the pack, Hillary Clinton at 69. Jesus wept! Gosh, how did that happen?

Sit with that for a moment:” There are only two reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the Trump Contingency: (1) Democracy doesn’t work and we all need to get behind Sweet Meteor of Death 2016; or (2) To the extent that Trump is standing in front of any sort of movement, that movement needs to be co-opted, not vanquished, if Republicans want to have a chance of victory this cycle. If you want option #2 — and I understand if you prefer #1 — then you have to start by figuring out what Trump is selling that attracts voters. And this doesn’t seem like rocket science. In 2012, the entire Republican field was caught by surprise when it turned out that immigration was the defining issue of the primary campaign. Without anyone having noticed, immigration displaced abortion as the major litmus test for GOP candidates. And then, to show that 2012 wasn’t an aberration, two years later an unknown, unfunded, econ professor bushwhacked Eric Cantor by 11 points in a Republican House primary in Virginia. His primary issue-indeed, just about his only issue-was immigration. So Republican strategists (and their candidates) ought to understand that Republican voters care a lot about immigration. And yet, the attitude of the GOP establishment towards these folks seems to be, as Mickey Kaus jokes, they just “cling to their rage about immigration because they can’t get what they really want: Low capital gains taxes.” And speaking of the GOP establishment, right on cue, John McCain in incensed that Trump has “fired up the crazies” in Arizona. “People who otherwise might be more centrist are angry about this border situation.” Yes, this happens when voters finally despise being insulted by the officials they elect, being pandered to, and strung along:  Posted at  by Ed Driscoll on Jul 16, 2015 at 4:45 pm Link RICK PERRY ON THE ATTACK:  Perry slams Obama for not cracking down on ‘sanctuary cities.’ Plus, Mickey Kaus notices a wedge problem for the Democrats, if the GOP is smart enough to exploit it.  (Trump is!)   From the story: The elder Shaw praised Trump in interviews this week on the Fox News Channel and with Loesch for his criticism of illegal immigration. Shaw told Loesch that Trump’s criticism of illegal immigration is “resonating in the black community because we see all the carnage that’s happened and all the memorials. We see all the jobs that are gone. We see the whole community changing.” Jamiel Shaw II was a Los Angeles High School football standout who was shot and killed in 2008 near his Arlington Heights home by a gang member who prosecutors said mistakenly perceived him as a gang rival because he was carrying a red Spider-Man backpack. Pedro Espinoza, convicted of first-degree murder in 2012 and sentenced to death, was living in the United States without legal permission at the time of the killing. He had been freed from jail two days before the shooting without immigration authorities placing a hold on him. First Shaw, then Kate Steinle.  Why do the Democrats hate blacks and women?

Egyptian-born al-Sibai, 54, reportedly lives on £50,000 a year in handouts, disability living allowance, with his wife and five children. Asked how he could justify taking so much in benefits, al-Sibai, who is under investigation suspected of benefit fraud, told the Daily Mail: “Ask David Cameron, don’t ask me.” Holding down a job is de-radicalizing.  It should be required, especially of immigrants.  If it saves just one life, it’s worth it. UPDATE:  I should add that Mickey Kaus has been making this point since 2001, but nobody’s listening.

Posted at  by Glenn Reynolds on Apr 22, 2015 at 1:30 pm Link MICKEY KAUS:  Hair Trigger Sneer: In the Washington Examiner, the otherwise estimable Philip Klein sneers at Scott Walker for saying that he’d worry about wages and job prospects for American workers when setting levels of legal immigration. According to Klein this shows Walker is “just telling conservatives what he thinks they want to hear” (which is entirely possible) and that he doesn’t understand “the broader philosophical or policy implications” and isn’t “able to make the transition to the big leagues,” which seems snotty. Why isn’t what Walker understands this: If we’re not going to have open borders, we have to set the level of legal immigration somewhere. In making that decision, it’s surely reasonable to take into account labor market conditions and wage levels. P.S.: What Walker said seems quite consistent with standard conservative plans (pushed by GOPs who support and GOPs who don’t support “comprehensive” reform) to give more immigration slots to higher-skilled workers and fewer to the low-skilled workers who bid down wages at the bottom, since it’s wages at the bottom we worry about most. You can’t be worried about wages for low-skilled workers, and simultaneously favor importing more low-skilled workers.

Economist Jared Bernstein will propose anything – apprenticeship programs! pre-K education! refundable child care credits! – except tightening the labor market by controlling the influx of immigrant workers. … P.S.: Bernstein also wants something called ‘fair chance hiring’ for job seekers with criminal records. It would certainly be good if those people could get jobs. But does Bernstein really think employers will ever hire Americans ‘with criminal records’ if they can instead hire eager workers from an inexhaustible stream of immigrants?” Bernstein won’t address this because the real point of immigration is to bring in a generation of docile Democratic voters.

Rubio, were told, is being urged to run for reelection to help prevent Democrats from winning the Senate. No doubt Jeb Bush’s extensive network had nothing to do with stoking either of these stories. … P.S.: But should Bush really want to push Rubio and Christie and other rivals out? Jeb isn’t doing terribly well in the polls, and his chances for winning would seem enhanced if the field is fragmented.  The worst thing for Jeb would be if there is a single, viable anti-Bush candidate,  especially if the anti-Bush candidate has contrasting views on immigration. That seems right.

131,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/yyflmNb1VAA/,"The shortlist of candidates for TIME’s 2018 Person of the Year was unveiled Monday on NBC’s Today show. Since 1927, TIME has identified the Person of the Year, recognizing the person or group of people who most influenced the news and the world — for better or for worse — during the past year. In recent years, the shortlist for Person of the Year has included the Silence Breakers of the #MeToo movement, Hillary Clinton, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Black Lives Matter activists, CRISPR scientists and Beyoncé. Here are the 10 finalists selected by TIME editors this year: The 45th president of the U.S., and TIME’s 2016 Person of the Year, marked his second year in office through navigating crises involving both himself and his staff, attacking an encircling investigation implicating people close to him, and enacting several controversial policies, ranging from separations at the border to an international trade war with China. More than 2,000 families were separated at the U.S. border this year under a Trump Administration policy aimed at deterring illegal immigration. Prompting backlash, the “zero tolerance” policy was announced in April and formally ended in June, and resulted in thousands of children being held in federal government facilities while their parents were sent to jail. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin secured a landslide victory in the country’s March elections, extending his term for another six years against the backdrop of scrutiny over Russia’s involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the U.K., and increasing tension with Ukraine. Featured as a runner up for TIME’s 2017 Person of the Year, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has continued to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election as well as key figures involved in the 2016 Trump campaign and administration. The investigation headed by the former FBI Director has already resulted in more than 191 criminal charges against 32 people and three companies. Director Ryan Coogler, 32, created this year’s phenomenally successful Marvel film Black Panther. The superhero movie, set in the fictional African country of Wakanda, featured a largely black cast and had the third-highest grossing U.S. release of all time. California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, 52, became a symbol for survivors of sexual assault as she testified against in front of senators in September about her allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee and now Judge Brett Kavanaugh. A prolific commentator and critic of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, journalist Jamal Khashoggi was last seen entering the country’s consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Believed to have been murdered on the orders of the Crown Prince, his death prompted international outcry and scrutiny of the Saudi regime. After 17 people were killed on Valentine’s Day in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., students from the school organized the #NeverAgain movement and the March for Our Lives demonstrations across America, campaigning for gun-control reforms to prevent similar tragedies. Since hosting Kim Jong Un’s sister at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has met his counterpart from the North in three historic summits on the future of the Korean Peninsula this year, as well as brokering the landmark meeting between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump. Former Hollywood actor and activist Meghan Markle traded in her roles on screen for a royal title in May, when she married Britain’s Prince Harry to the delight of captivated crowds across the U.K. and millions more worldwide.

132,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/us/california-today-housing-bill.html,"Advertisement Supported by California Today By Jill Cowan Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) You probably already know that a widespread housing shortage, especially in California’s cities, has become one of the state’s most intractable problems. If you can’t afford to live close to your job, you have to spend more time on the road. And if you have to spend time on the road, your car is adding to the state’s horrific traffic as well as pollution, and so on. So last year, Scott Wiener, a state senator from San Francisco, filed a controversial bill, called S.B. 827, aimed at addressing the issue. The idea was to, as the Times reporters Conor Dougherty and Brad Plumer wrote, “allow eight-story buildings near major transit stops, even if local communities object,” to encourage denser housing near public transit. But the proposal left many parties unhappy. Union officials worried that provisions to streamline development approvals would affect workers. Anti-gentrification advocates worried the bill would lead to the displacement of people living in existing neighborhoods. City leaders didn’t want to give up the ability to shape their communities. The bill eventually died a high-profile death. Which brings us about up-to-date. Mr. Wiener brought the bill back last week — but with some changes. I asked Conor, who covers housing from the Times’s San Francisco bureau, about what could be next. The conversation is edited and condensed. Jill Cowan: The big question is, does the bill have a shot at passing this time? Conor Dougherty: I don’t know. Does it have a better shot of passing? Probably, because Wiener has gotten construction unions on board, and he has addressed some of the concerns about gentrification. When S.B. 827 failed, it was opposed by the mayor of Beverly Hills, the Sierra Club and anti-gentrification advocates. Can he split that kind of coalition? Getting the unions on board helps, but it’s still very early and there will be plenty of powerful opponents. But where does this fall among legislative priorities? It’s still unclear where Gavin Newsom stands on this. In the last election voters across California voted for affordable housing and homelessness services. People are clearly worried about housing, especially after the wildfires, but it’s a question of whether people and legislators really believe this bill will help the housing crisis. I think people believe that more than they did a year ago. There are already a ton of other housing bills this year, so if it does pass it will probably be paired with other legislation, such as tenant protection bills or money for affordable housing.

While Ms. Burke emphasized that it’s not a competition, California tends to get storms with a lot of moisture compared with other parts of the country. That means more snow. “It’s something that we really try to tell people about,” she said.

Slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, and staffers at the Maryland daily Capital Gazette, the five who were gunned down in their newsroom and their colleagues who kept reporting that day’s events, have been given Time’s designation as “The Guardians.” The publication said its Person of the Year honor this year recognizes those “who have taken great risks in pursuit of greater truths.” Filipina journalist and media firm Rappler’s chief executive Maria Ressa, working as authoritarian Rodrigo Duterte remains in power, and Reuters correspondents Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, detained in Myanmar, are included as Time’s “Guardians.” As are other noted examples from Sudan to Brazil, all detailed in the Time article. The execution of Khashoggi, at a Saudi consulate in Turkey in October, has filtered into oil markets
        US:CLF9
       and even the stock market at times, as well as ongoing news coverage of the Trump White House, including the relationship between Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and Jared Kushner. “Every detail of Jamal Khashoggi’s killing made it a sensation: the time stamp on the surveillance video that captured the Saudi journalist entering his country’s Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2; the taxiway images of the private jets bearing his assassins; the bone saw; the reports of his final words, ‘I can’t breathe,’ recorded on audio as the life was choked from him,” Time wrote. “As we looked at the choices, it became clear that the manipulation and abuse of truth is really the common thread in so many of this year’s major stories  from Russia to Riyadh to Silicon Valley,” Time editor in chief Edward Felsenthal said on the “Today” show. The choice wasn’t without criticism, with some pointing to the shift toward group or trend winners over a singular figure. “In 2001, the magazine selected Rudy Giuliani over Osama bin Laden, demonstrating that they were willing to bend the rules to avoid offense, controversy, and/or bad newsstand sales,” a National Review commentator wrote Monday as the shortlist was issued. “The modern criteria is a little fuzzier — it’s now an important figure or group that symbolized a story or trend that dominated the news, that is likely to sell a lot of copies.” Last year, the magazine’s editors selected the Silence Breakers, those who were credited with sparking a national reckoning over the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault. President Trump, the 2016 Time winner, was a runner-up this year. So was Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is investigating the Trump campaign and who serves as a near-daily target of the president’s tweeting. The Time shortlist also included Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Time winner a decade ago; Christine Blasey Ford, who accused in front of Congress and the cameras the now-confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, which he denies. Other 2018 candidates included South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in, voted into office after the corruption scandals that plagued his predecessor and who brokered the Trump meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un; Ryan Coogler, the writer and director, whose blockbuster “Black Panther” landed the empowering “Wakanda forever!” in the cultural lexicon; and Meghan Markle, the previously married American actress who wed Britain’s Prince Harry this year. Read:Wakanda forever: The overt feminism of ‘Black Panther’ This year’s group distinction could have been given to families separated at the U.S.’s southern border, the Time shortlist indicated. At the height of a summertime border crisis, thousands of children were split from their parents after being caught trying to illegally cross from Mexico to the U.S., although some were pursuing asylum. Immigration officials held children in warehouse-like conditions, as part of a controversial Trump administration “zero-tolerance policy” that was later adjusted by executive order.

He intercepted a cardboard box she appeared to throw. He tossed it back. “Can you not? I said I’ll be out soon.” Then he rushed toward her, delivering what sounds like a hard slap. She wailed. A child’s voice called out. The man repeated a chilling line to the woman: “How many times do I have to tell you?” The woman realized a child in the home outside Sydney was not the only potential witness. “You hear that? All you people there,” she said, apparently speaking to people watching the match over Twitch, the popular streaming social site. “He just hit me in the face!” Police arrested and changed the 26-year old man with common assault hours later, the New South Wales police said in a statement Monday, as profanity-laced and disturbing video of the incident circulated online. “While the woman was not seriously injured she was distressed and shaken by the incident,” the police said of the unnamed 21-year-old woman. She was given a protective order. A 3-year-old girl and a toddler were in the home at the time, police said. A police spokesperson declined to provide the man’s name, citing laws that prohibit releasing details ahead of a court appearance, which is scheduled for Thursday. Australian media identified him as Luke James Munday. He could not be reached for comment. Recorded video of the incident was considered evidence for investigators, a police spokesperson said. It was not clear whether the woman was the man’s wife or partner, police said. A spokesperson for Twitch did not return a request for comment on the incident involving Munday. The battle-royale game “Fortnite” dominates Twitch. Viewers watched 7.7 billion minutes of players battling each other in August. That’s about 14,650 years. It appeared that Munday deleted a wide swath of his internet presence; his Twitch account under @MrDeadMoth has vanished, as have Twitter and Facebook accounts listed under his still-active YouTube channel. It is not clear when the Twitch account was deleted, though analytics from the site Social Blade show nearly all of his more than 5,000 subscribers disappeared Sunday. The ubiquity of video and social media has produced a postmodern reality – raw and sometimes violent moments broadcast across the world. In August, a laser sight flickered on the chest of a gamer at a Madden tournament in a video captured on Twitch. A gunman fired in the next instant at the event in Jacksonville, Florida, killing two people before he turned the gun on himself. In February, Snapchat videos from the Parkland, Florida, mass shooting circulated before officials released details about the dead. And YouTube was awash in videos of people fleeing audible rifle fire in Las Vegas in the midst of the worst mass killing in modern U.S. history.

136,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/12/10/gamer-in-australia-arrested-after-live-streaming-womans-screams/,"Trending: By Alex Horton | Washington Post MrDeadMoth was focused on his lamp-wielding “Fortnite” avatar before a woman’s off-screen voice dissolved the fantasy visage streaming online. “I’ll be out soon,” the gamer insisted Sunday evening, his voice rising. “Just wait!” They tussled. He intercepted a cardboard box she appeared to throw. He tossed it back. “Can you not? I said I’ll be out soon.” Then he rushed toward her, delivering what sounds like a hard slap. She wailed. A child’s voice called out. The man repeated a chilling line to the woman: “How many times do I have to tell you?” The woman realized a child in the home outside Sydney was not the only potential witness. “You hear that? All you people there,” she said, apparently speaking to people watching the match over Twitch, the popular streaming social site. “He just hit me in the face!” Police arrested and changed the 26-year old man with common assault hours later, the New South Wales police said in a statement Monday, as profanity-laced and disturbing video of the incident circulated online. “While the woman was not seriously injured she was distressed and shaken by the incident,” the police said of the unnamed 21-year-old woman. She was given a protective order. A 3-year-old girl and a toddler were in the home at the time, police said. A police spokesperson declined to provide the man’s name, citing laws that prohibit releasing details ahead of a court appearance, which is scheduled for Thursday. Australian media identified him as Luke James Munday. He could not be reached for comment. Recorded video of the incident was considered evidence for investigators, a police spokesperson said. It was not clear whether the woman was the man’s wife or partner, police said. A spokesperson for Twitch did not return a request for comment on the incident involving Munday. The battle-royale game “Fortnite” dominates Twitch. Viewers watched 7.7 billion minutes of players battling each other in August. That’s about 14,650 years. It appeared that Munday deleted a wide swath of his internet presence; his Twitch account under @MrDeadMoth has vanished, as have Twitter and Facebook accounts listed under his still-active YouTube channel. It is not clear when the Twitch account was deleted, though analytics from the site Social Blade show nearly all of his more than 5,000 subscribers disappeared Sunday. The ubiquity of video and social media has produced a postmodern reality – raw and sometimes violent moments broadcast across the world. In August, a laser sight flickered on the chest of a gamer at a Madden tournament in a video captured on Twitch. A gunman fired in the next instant at the event in Jacksonville, Florida, killing two people before he turned the gun on himself. In February, Snapchat videos from the Parkland, Florida, mass shooting circulated before officials released details about the dead. And YouTube was awash in videos of people fleeing audible rifle fire in Las Vegas in the midst of the worst mass killing in modern U.S. history. Australian police deal with 5,000 domestic violence incidents a week, according to ABC News.

137,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/BW2tWTUuBNU/,"Streaming TV may have ushered in an era of binge-friendly serialization, but it has also done surprisingly good things for the individual episode. By switching up storytelling formats—throwing in a long flashback, a bottle episode or even a show-within-the-show—series can hold viewers’ interest for hours on end while also building in talking points for fans on social media. Every year, it seems like more series are putting out remarkable standalone stories—and in 2018, that number includes the surreal comedy that aired the single greatest episode of television in recent memory. For a booming medium that has historically relied too much on templates, this attention to detail constitutes yet another welcome change. Black-ish has always deftly balanced character comedy, classic “hugging and learning” family sitcom plots and topical conversations about race in America. To celebrate its 100th episode, the show channeled all of those familiar elements into a fun musical tribute to Prince. Amid sing-along performances of hits like “When Doves Cry” and “Sign o’ the Times,” three generations of Johnsons educate young Lil Pump fans Diane (Marsai Martin) and Jack (Miles Brown) about the late pop icon’s legacy as a rebel, a sex symbol, a gender bender and a deeply political artist. Over the course of the episode, every family member gets a chance to play the Purple One—a choice that underscores how Prince empowered the fans who idolized him. If there’s one trait that defines the Ryan Murphy universe, it’s a fragile combination of sincerity and camp. That’s a volatile mix of tones to bring to true crime, where it’s easy to trivialize innocent people’s pain. Early episodes of writer Tom Rob Smith’s reverse-chronological portrait of gay spree killer Andrew Cunanan—who murdered at least four men before gunning down Gianni Versace in 1994—adhered to that formula anyway, with over-the-top musical numbers and operatic death scenes. Yet Episode 3, “A Random Killing,” rinsed off the soap suds in a stark imagining of Cunanan’s slaying of allegedly closeted Chicago real estate tycoon Lee Miglin. Judith Light was devastating as Lee’s widow, Marilyn, who suffers both the nightmare of her husband’s death and a bitter reckoning with their relationship that has been decades in the making. Killing Eve is a show about desire. Frustrated British intelligence agent Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh) seeks excitement—and her target, glamorous international assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer), yearns for the simple domestic comforts Eve takes for granted. These complementary cravings set them on a collision course, their mutual obsession heightened by the physical distance that separates them. It takes more than half of the show’s eight-episode first season for the women to properly meet. When they do, in an intense sequence that is the centerpiece of “I Have a Thing About Bathrooms,” their encounter is oddly intimate; they seem equally likely to fight, kiss or jump out a window clutching each other’s hands. The fact that Comer and Oh didn’t even rehearse together before they shot the scene only makes their chemistry more remarkable. Ambitious TV series occasionally trade cinematic conventions for theatrical ones, staging bottle episodes or even one-person shows. This approach probably shouldn’t work for animated comedies, but BoJack Horseman had pulled off greater feats (remember the silent underwater episode?) before its makers decided to devote the bulk of “Free Churro” to a eulogy from its anthropomorphic horse antihero. Spanning more than 20 minutes, BoJack’s farewell to his emotionally distant mother is, by turns, wistful, bitter, funny and profoundly meta. (“All I know about being good I learned from TV,” he says. “In TV, people are always showing people they care with these surprising grand gestures, and I think that part of me still believes that’s what love is.”) Creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, who wrote “Free Churro,” and Will Arnett, the voice of BoJack, both deserve credit for an episode that made me forget I was watching a cartoon horse. Calhoun Day is a mere footnote in Gillian Flynn’s debut novel Sharp Objects, but this expansive miniseries devoted a crucial episode to the annual festival that brings (white) residents of fictional Wind Gap, Missouri, together on the lawn of protagonist Camille Preaker’s (Amy Adams) family home. The revelers are paying tribute to their town’s founding myth—an outrageous tale that paints Union soldiers as the Civil War’s real villains and honors a woman’s stoic endurance of the sexual violence men inflict on her. A Calhoun Day pageant, performed by high schoolers on MDMA, is full-on surreal. Even as it collected suspects and investigators in one place (this is nominally a whodunit, after all), “Closer” synthesized the show’s themes of femininity, victimhood and prejudice, elegantly exposing the lies a community tells itself in order to live. Toni Collette won heaps of well-deserved praise for her lead role in this year’s arty horror sensation Hereditary, but even that performance doesn’t compare to what she achieved in the fifth episode of the BBC/Netflix collaboration Wanderlust. Collette starred as Joy Richards, a therapist and loving mother who convinces her husband (Steven Mackintosh) that sleeping with other people will get them out of a sexual rut. The open marriage is thrilling—until, predictably, it isn’t. As that crisis accelerates, Joy visits her own shrink, the quiet but sharp Angela (Hotel Rwanda Oscar nominee Sophie Okonedo), for a difficult session that makes up the miniseries’ entire penultimate hour. Therapy is an easy shortcut to a character’s internal life—and there’s been way too much of it on TV since The Sopranos. But, as written by creator Nick Payne and interpreted by these two exhilaratingly present actors, the encounter isn’t a feelings dump so much as an act of collaborative interpretation that has the electrifying immediacy of live theater. The second season of this ’80s women’s wrestling comedy didn’t have quite the same momentum as its predecessor, but its highs made for some of the year’s most delightful TV moments. Facing cancellation, the Gorgeous Ladies and their B-movie director boss (Marc Maron) went out with a glittery bang, reinventing their scrappy program as a combination Soviet spy thriller, Broadway musical and MTV pastiche, with some wrestling thrown in for good measure. “The Good Twin” was a full-length episode of that show-within-a-show. Though it actually did push the plot forward in surprising ways, its exuberant weirdness—the signature quality of local late-night programming at the dawn of cable—mostly added a dose of dream logic to what had previously been a relatively conventional narrative. In 2018, it wasn’t uncommon to awaken from a dream into a real, shared nightmare: a mass shooting, a natural disaster, a federal policy of ripping immigrant children from their parents’ arms and confining them to actual cages. High Maintenance, a low-key series about a weed delivery guy (co-creator Ben Sinclair) that also happens to be the best show currently airing about life in New York City, kicked off its first season since October 2016 with just such a morning. An unnamed devastating event has stoners summoning their dealer in droves, and “Globo” follows this healer of sorts through a city in mourning. People cry in the streets, fantasize about moving abroad, float absurd predictions for how the next few years will play out—and, finally, a modest vision of hope shines through. The 24th chapter of The Good Place was a perfect half-hour of high-concept comedy. Disguised in the 1940s fashions that predominate in the administrative offices of hell, Michael (Ted Danson) and the four unfortunate souls he’s spent centuries attempting to torture sneak into Bad Place HQ. There, they find a museum of monstrous human behavior that features an animatronic model of the first woman to floss in an open-plan office and meet demons who call each other “broham.” The one-liners from writers Jen Statsky and Dan Schofield were killer (“This is hell. Of course there’s a gift shop”). And, in typical Good Place style, each one was in service of an object lesson in moral particularism and a fully earned breakthrough for Michael. With apologies to the Oscars, the Bachelor franchise and sports in general, the year’s most absorbing event program was Atlanta: Robbin’ Season. There was simply no telling how wild any given episode of Donald Glover’s amorphous show would get—and “Teddy Perkins” even out-weirded a first season that included a black Justin Bieber and an invisible car. Helmed by Glover’s director of choice, Hiro Murai, the episode opens with Lakeith Stanfield’s Darius driving to a gated mansion to pick up a free piano. He’s greeted by Teddy Perkins, an older man in a smoking jacket with a high voice and unnaturally smooth, white skin who is transforming his lonely home into a museum in honor of his ailing musician brother, Benny (Derrick Haywood). Mounting tensions transform their encounter into a comedic horror movie about black fathers destroying their talented children in an effort to transcend an unacceptable status quo. When it comes to race and horror, Get Out is the obvious comparison, but in “Teddy Perkins” the call is coming from inside the house. But it wasn’t just the content that made for such a singular viewing experience. FX aired the 41-minute episode without ads, and as Darius descended into his own personal Twilight Zone, Twitter lit up with questions: Who was that beneath the makeup? Shouldn’t there have been a commercial break by now? Was this about Michael Jackson? A few answers—notably, that Glover had played the title role—trickled out along with the theories. Guides to the episode’s many cultural references appeared. Months later, Teddy accompanied the Atlanta crew to the Emmys, and we still don’t know who was actually inside the costume. It was a fitting coda for a character that had taken on a life of its own. Will that be the last we see of Teddy Perkins? I wouldn’t bet on it.

Monday, 10 December 2018 12:15 PM Both President Donald Trump and special counsel Robert Mueller are on Time Magazine’s shortlist of candidates for 2018 Person of the Year, which the publication announced on Monday. Time plans to announce the winner on Tuesday. Others on the shortlist are Russian President Vladimir Putin, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, director Ryan Coogler, murdered Saudi Jamal Khashoggi, Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle and Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who testified beforevsenators in September about her allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee and now Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The list also includes, The Hill pointed out, two groups of people: the “March For Our Lives” teenage activists who reignited the nationwide debate on gun control following the mass shooting at their Parkland, Florida high school; and the thousands of families who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border by the Trump Administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy. The publication said, “Every year, Time selects the most influential person of the year, noting, for better or for worse, the person or group of people who have had the greatest impact on the news and the world over the past 12 months.” Trump won in 2016, while the designation went last year to the women behind the #MeToo movement, dubbed the “Silence Breakers.”   © 2021 Newsmax.

Damon Joseph, 21, from Holland, Ohio, was arrested Friday evening after he took possession of two AR-15 rifles, officials said. He was charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to ISIS. “This man spent months planning a violent terrorist attack on behalf of ISIS here in the United States, and eventually targeted a Jewish synagogue in the Toledo area,” said U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman of the Northern District of Ohio in a press release. “The charges describe a calculated man fueled by an ideology of hatred and intent on killing innocent people.” Joseph allegedly told FBI undercover agents he was inspired by the Oct. 27 attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11 people. “I admire what the guy did with the shooting, actually,” Joseph said, according to the FBI. “I can see myself carrying out this type of operations inshallah. They wouldn’t even expect (an attack) in my area.” (""Inshallah"" is Arabic for ""if Allah is willing."") In the nearby city of Toledo, agents on Monday morning arrested Elizabeth Lecron, 23, for allegedly buying bomb-building materials such as screws and gunpowder. She is charged with one count of transportation of explosives and explosive material for the purposes of harming others and property. Lecron came to the attention of law enforcement earlier this year after one of her associates expressed a desire to conduct a violent attack, according to an affidavit cited in a separate Justice Department press release. She allegedly traveled to Colorado to visit Columbine High School, the site of a 1999 mass shooting. At about the same time, she corresponded with Dylann Roof, the white supremacist convicted of killing nine African-Americans at a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015, attempting to send him Nazi literature, officials said. She allegedly communicated with undercover agents and confidential sources in early August that she had ""devised a plan to commit 'upscale mass murder' "" at a Toledo bar, according to a criminal complaint. ""She stated she knows there are only two ways in and out. and therefore, they could be at a better tactical advantage when thew police arrived,"" the complaint said. Investigators also accused Lecron of planning attacks on a manufacturing plant and a farm with livestock. “Removing Elizabeth Lecron from the ranks of civilized society by virtue of arrest and prosecution thwarts her explicitly stated desire to engage in acts of death and destruction,” FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Jeff Fortunato said in the press release. Lecron went by “Bee Lecron” on several websites, where she was an active member of several niche web communities. On DeviantArt, a social network where users submit personally created art, Lecron posted a hand-drawn, anime-style cartoon of Dylann Roof in between Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. The artwork is titled “Killers,” and was added to collections of drawings of the Columbine shootings by other DeviantArt users. One user, using the name “DylannRoof,” gave the lone reply to the post in March. “I love you,” Lecron’s account responded to “DylannRoof” on Oct. 21, eight months later. Lacron was also behind a Tumblr account, “CharlestonChurchMiracle,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. That account, which is still live, contains hundreds of images that glorify mass killings including photos and gifs of perpetrators of school shootings. Lecron otherwise mostly drew pictures of “furries,” or caricatures of cartoon animals, and was a member of furry communities online. She and Joseph, although they lived in the same area of Ohio, had no connections, officials said. David K. Li is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.

140,https://pjmedia.com/trending/ohio-man-arrested-for-planning-isis-inspired-mass-shootings-against-synagogues-in-toledo/,"On Monday, the FBI announced that it had arrested 21-year-old Damon Joseph for planning multiple mass shootings at synagogues in the Toledo, Ohio, area. Joseph had reportedly been inspired by the Islamic State (ISIS) and announced his intention to target Jews on the Sabbath. He had also expressed hatred for gays, Christians, Catholics, and Jews. Joseph was arrested on Friday after purchasing two AR-15 rifles and openly announcing his plans to kill many people, including a rabbi, the Times of Israel reported. According to an affidavit filed in the U.S. District Court in Toledo, Joseph said he was inspired by the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, Pa., in October, which killed 11. Earlier this month, Joseph told an undercover FBI agent that the Tree of Life victims “got what was coming to them,” that Jews were evil, and that he was targeting synagogues in the Toledo area to carry out a mass shooting in the name of ISIS. “I admire what the guy did with the shooting actually,” Joseph wrote to an FBI agent. “I can see myself carrying out this type of operation inshallah. They wouldn’t even expect [an attack] in my area.” The affidavit claims that Joseph was deciding between two synagogues as late as December 4. He said the choice “would depend on ‘which one will have the most people, what time and what day. Go big or go home.'” On December 6, he had chosen a synagogue, telling the FBI agent “he had conducted research to determine when the Jewish sabbath was so that more people would be present.” If convicted of terrorism, Joseph could face up to 20 years in prison. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) praised law enforcement for preventing this planned ISIS attack. “We are tremendously grateful to law enforcement at both the federal and local levels for apprehending the suspect, and for working so diligently to prevent terror from hitting our community,” ADL Cleveland Regional Director Jeremy Pappas declared. “The Jewish community is still grieving following the October attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We can never let that happen again.” “We cannot tolerate hate directed toward people of Jewish faith, or of any other religion, and last month’s mass-killing at a Pittsburgh synagogue is a reminder of just how real this threat is,” Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz said in a statement. “As Hanukkah concludes this evening, all Toledoans should reflect on the holiday’s themes of liberation, identity, and most importantly, freedom from religious persecution.” While the Islamic State has suffered serious defeats in the region of Iraq and Syria — the heartland it attempted to conquer — the radical Islamic terrorist group continues to plague the world with isolated terror attacks. In 2017, ISIS carried out at least 17 terror attacks in the West, and more elsewhere. Groups like ADL have rightly condemned the anti-Semitism behind the Tree of Life shooting and Joseph’s plans for terror in Toledo, but liberal groups are so focused on hate from the Right they often overlook the many Democrats who have taken photos with notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan. Even worse, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), often an ally of the ADL, overlooked the rampant anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial across the Muslim world America must remain committed against radical Islamic terrorism and anti-Semitism from both the Right and the Left. The arrest of Damon Joseph proves that radical Islamic terrorism is still a threat today, and Americans must remain vigilant. Follow the author of this article on Twitter at @Tyler2ONeil.

          / CBS News WASHINGTON — The FBI announced Monday it made arrests in two separate terror plots near Toledo, Ohio. Both suspects had been talking about and planning the attacks for months, authorities said. According to the FBI, Elizabeth Lecron was obsessed with the idea of carrying out mass murder. She was arrested Saturday after she purchased black powder and screws for making a bomb. She told an undercover agent she wanted to target a Toledo bar, and also discussed bombing a pipeline or attacking a farm, officials said. ""She stated she had been involved in a plan to commit an 'upscale mass murder,' as she called it,"" said Jeff Fortunato, an FBI assistant special agent in charge. According to court documents, Lecron was active on social media. On Tumblr, she posted ""photographs and comments glorifying mass murders like the Columbine shooters and Dylann Roof."" Roof, a white supremacist, shot and killed nine African-Americans in a Charleston, South Carolina church in 2015. In the weeks leading up to her arrest, Lecron wrote to Roof in prison. According to court papers, he wrote back, asking her to ""mail him several books about civil uprisings and the Nazis."" In the second Toledo case, the FBI said 21-year-old Damon Joseph, who investigators believe was radicalized by ISIS online, planned to target two Toledo area synagogues. Court papers allege he praised the October attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh, telling an undercover FBI agent, ""My opinion is the Jews are evil and they get what's coming to them."" Fortunato said Joseph wanted to carry out a similar mass shooting. ""Days ago, he provided an undercover employee a draft plan which outlined general operational and logistical considerations for an attack,"" Fortunato said. In both cases, it was the words and the actions of the suspects that caught the attention of investigators. Because the FBI was tracking these cases for months, investigators said the public was not in danger. First published on December 10, 2018 / 6:33 PM © 2018 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

143,http://www.nationalmemo.com/neo-nazis-praise-nra-urging-militants-to-join/,"Reprinted with permission from MediaMatters.  The Daily Stormer — a major online hub for racists and anti-Semites that has followers who have committed mass murder — has been telling its readers to join the National Rifle Association, as the neo-Nazis who run the website see a successful NRA as their best possible hope to see Jewish people subjected to another Holocaust. The Daily Stormer has been very pleased with the NRA’s hard-line messaging in the Trump era: As the neo-Nazi website itself notes, the NRA frequently singles out Jews as its political enemies and refuses to condemn anti-Semitic actions taken by members of its leadership. A February 2017 Daily Stormer article explained, “There is basically zero chance that [NRA leader Wayne] LaPierre and others in the top ranks of the NRA aren’t aware of the Jewish issue, especially as it relates to the second amendment. They’ve remained silent on this topic until now, scared of the media power that the Jews possess. But things are changing.” The Daily Stormer has frequently promoted NRA membership drives, including repeatedly linking to an NRA recruitment website and claiming,“The number 1 source of new recruits for the NRA has always been the Daily Stormer.” In articles posted on the website, Daily Stormer writers implore readers to join the NRA:  According to The Daily Stormer, “The NRA is the country’s premiere pro-white and anti-Semitic organization. In fact, it is the only right-wing group of any kind in this country to have any success at all in the last 50 years.” The Daily Stormer clearly sees the NRA as a tool it can use to instigate wide-scale attacks against Jewish people. Here are a few pro-NRA threatening messages the site has posted: The Daily Stormer also posted a meme featuring NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch to threaten, “Our patience has its limits,” writing, “And guess what kikes? Your outrage machine is broken.”  Following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, The Daily Stormer backed the NRA’s calls for arming teachers, writing: The Daily Stormer is endorsing a plan to take it a step further, and arm the students as well. Say you’re in class, the teacher is writing something on the board, and a Jew pulls out a gun. The teacher has his back to the class and doesn’t see the Jew make his move – but you’re sitting behind him, and you’ve got a clean shot – why shouldn’t you be allowed to take it? The Daily Stormer is particularly enamored of five high-profile NRA employees: Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre, President Oliver North, national spokesperson Dana Loesch, NRATV host Chuck Holton, and NRA board member Ted Nugent. The Daily Stormer has labeled LaPierre “/ourlad/” and “Reichsmarschall,” the highest military rank in Nazi Germany, and favorably called the NRA leader an “anti-Semitic white nationalist.” In particular, the site likes LaPierre because of a speech he gave after the Parkland school shooting in which he called opponents of the NRA “European-style socialists,” which, as The Daily Stormer explained, “everyone acknowledges, means ‘Jews’” or “the gun-grabbing kikes.” The Daily Stormer has favorably mentioned that LaPierre “gave a speech calling out the Jews as gun grabbers,” noted that LaPierre “purposefully pushed for an open war with the Jews,” and written that “he literally put out a Jew list, showing that everyone who disagrees with gun rights is a Jew. And he has to know, too. There is no way you list off a dozen Jews – and not a single goy – without noticing that pattern.” Indeed, LaPierre has frequently targeted Jews during his public remarks. In May, The Daily Stormer heaped praise on North after he became president of the NRA. An article on the neo-Nazi website argued, “The NRA just made a great pick for their new head. Great, great pick.” The website described North’s involvement in the Iran-Contra arms trafficking scandal as a positive, writing, “This is one guy who definitely does not give a single fuck about having a license to buy and sell weapons. For those who don’t know – the Iran-Contra ‘scandal’ was a program of selling weapons to Iran and using the money from that to fund communist-killing death squads in Latin America.” The article speculated that as president of the NRA, North could help arm Iran with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that the country could then use against Israel. The Daily Stormer also has a lot of praise for NRA national spokesperson Loesch, whom it calls “Princess Dana.” The site praised the gun group for not firing Loesch for her recently resurfaced 2010 tweet that said, “I bet Rick Sanchez was fired by a Jew.” (Sanchez was fired from CNN after he made anti-Semitic remarks about comedian Jon Stewart.) Loesch said that her tweet was meant to be an appeal to poetic justice. The Daily Stormer wrote that instead of firing her, the NRA “doubled-down by giving her a show about how she is going to destroy the Jews,” referencing promotional material for her NRATV show Relentless in which Loesch has threatened members of the media that their “time is running out.” The Daily Stormer has also praised Chuck Holton, a correspondent for the NRA’s media operation NRATV. During a July 2017 appearance on NRATV, Holton suggested that Black people were poised to commit mass rape and murder against white people while referencing “what’s happening in South Africa.” In response, The Daily Stormer wrote, “Holy shit! The NRA cited the White Genocide in South Africa as a warning to America!” Holton has a lengthy history of promoting white nationalism and making racist comments, and he has repeatedly pushed the conspiracy theory that Jewish philanthropist George Soros is behind the migrant caravan traveling through Central America and Mexico — a remarkably similar theory to the one that inspired a gunman to carry out an anti-Semitic massacre at a Pittsburgh, PA, synagogue in October. The site is aware of NRATV and has disturbingly noted, “A NRA tv channel calling out ‘socialist corruption’ 24/7 would be the best thing ever, especially considering that all of these ‘European-style socialists’ are actually Jews.” (Three months after that Daily Stormer article was published and a day after an ISIS terror attack in Manchester, U.K., Holton argued on NRATV that “this wave of violence that we’re seeing across Europe is a symptom of the broader problem of multiculturalism and socialism.”) The Daily Stormer also lauded NRA board member Ted Nugent for sharing an anti-Semitic meme on Facebook without repercussions from the NRA, writing, “I’ve gotta give it to Ted. I expected an apology within hours. Instead he is just straight trolling these Jews. It’s fantastic.” In February, a Daily Stormer article defending the NRA as a friendly home for anti-Semites brought up the incident: “Remember another NRA spokesperson, Ted Nugent, posted that one meme a couple years ago… So, the NRA knows and the Jews know the NRA knows, and both sides want to escalate that.” The NRA’s recent adoption of more extreme messaging tactics is not lost on The Daily Stormer. As the neo-Nazis who run the website cheered in a March article, “The NRA is done with euphemisms.”  Know first. The opinions that matter.

145,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/v6pXVQoHj34/,"Even if you count the time television cameras lingered on her face after she left the packed Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room, Christine Blasey Ford’s appearance on the public stage lasted less than 4½ hours. For any other well-known figure, that would be a blink of an eye. But for Ford, it was long enough to establish herself, for millions, as something of an American hero. As she described having been sexually assaulted by then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when she was 15 years old, protesters in the Capitol scrawled We Believe on the palms of their hands. The hashtag ­#WhyIDidntReport exploded on social media—both a ­rallying cry for survivors and a rebuke to those who doubted that a woman might wait decades to come forward. Shirts emblazoned with Ford’s face went on sale across the Internet; celebrities from Julianne Moore to Lady Gaga voiced their support for her; and Ford herself received more than 150,000 personal letters, from teenagers and middle-aged women and octogenarians, all of whom recognized themselves in her pain. But in the weeks and months after that whirlwind, we’re still grappling with her legacy. A year into a massive reckoning on sexual harassment, her experience was at once a galvanizing illustration of how much had changed and a poignant reminder of all that had not. After all, her decision to speak out despite her terror failed to move the needle among those in power on Capitol Hill. Just over a week after Ford’s emotional Sept. 27 testimony, the Senate vote on Kava­naugh, who has “categorically and unequivocally” denied her claims, unfolded exactly as it might have had she not come forward at all. The man she had accused in such excruciating detail was honored with a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. It was in this context that millions of Americans—and perhaps especially those who related to Ford’s description of the after­effects of sexual assault—felt something akin to a gut punch: What was the point? Part of the frustration arose from the fact that Ford was, in many ways, an ideal witness. She was likable, relatable and, as a professor of psychology, able to offer fluent explanations of brain science. When asked to account for the certainty of some of her recollections, she patiently explained how norepinephrine and epinephrine encode memories into the hippo­campus. When asked how sure she was that it was Kava­naugh who attacked her more than three decades ago, she was unflinching. “One hundred percent,” she said. Ford was also perhaps an ideal witness in another way. Because her demeanor did not challenge persistent stereotypes about how a “good woman” should behave, viewers were forced to focus solely on the facts. During her testimony, Ford, who is a wife and mother, was unflaggingly gracious, soft-spoken and deferential. Not once did she interrupt a Senator. Not once did she refuse to answer a question. Not once did she become threatening or frustrated or—to use the word so often weaponized against passionate women­—shrill. Particularly when contrasted with the distinctly male anger on display when it came time for Kavanaugh to speak, the gender dynamics surrounding her demeanor were hard not to notice, but she appeared to navigate their perils. After her testimony, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, congratulated her for her bravery, and President Trump, rarely one to give credence to the claims of female accusers, called her a “very fine woman” and a “credible witness.” The reaction among the top male Senators of the Judiciary Committee gave many people a jolt of hope, if only because it stood in sharp contrast to the reaction that met similar testimony 26 years earlier. In 1991, when Anita Hill had come before the same committee to accuse then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, she had been discredited, mocked and dismissed. This time around, Ford had been commended. The moment seemed to confirm that a profound and wished-for cultural sea change had taken place. So when Kavanaugh was nevertheless confirmed, many who had done such wishing were devastated. If a woman like Ford could not halt the machinery of power, there seemed to be little hope for anyone else. In responding to reporters’ questions, Senators who voted to confirm the new Justice tended to perform a rhetorical balancing act. Some defended their votes by deflecting questions of Ford’s credibility. They believed that she’d been assaulted, they explained; they just didn’t believe Kavanaugh had done it. Others sidestepped the issue. Even if the assault did happen as she described, they seemed to suggest, it simply didn’t matter: no adult should be accountable for his behavior as a teenager many decades ago. Whether fully sincere or merely wary of backlash, they were nicer to Ford than their counterparts had been to Hill—but the system that undergirds their power forged ahead just the same. And President Trump, after initially describing Ford’s testimony as “compelling,” showed that perhaps the optics hadn’t changed that much after all. At political rallies in the lead-up to the midterm elections, he began mocking Ford, imitating her inability to remember some details about the evening she was assaulted. “I don’t know. I don’t know,” Trump said, waving his hands. “What neighborhood was it in? I don’t know. Where’s the house? I don’t know.” Soon conservative media jumped on the bandwagon. Right-wing firebrand Rush Limbaugh labeled Ford “the product of a Democrat Party operation,” while Fox News pundits questioned the timing of her decision to go public, despite her explanations of how she’d made up her mind. Just weeks before the November elections, the controversy surrounding Kavanaugh’s nomination had become a political liability for Democrats. Polls reported that Republican voters, motivated by Ford’s testimony and Kavanaugh’s impassioned rebuttal, were now more likely to vote. And yet, around dinner tables and in online discussions, Ford’s supporters defended her legacy. Here was someone who had sacrificed her privacy and her family’s security because she believed it was her civic duty to tell her story. Here was someone who believed that a consideration of a man’s character was incomplete unless it took into account credible accusations of sexual assault. Here was someone who believed, ultimately, that a single voice could still make a difference. That those ideals are not always reflected in real life does not diminish them. In the days after Kavanaugh was sworn in, the leaders of the #MeToo movement made this point in an open “love letter” to Ford. She showed that speaking up does matter—that the world is listening, even if the people in front of you are not. Acts of heroism, after all, are not merely a means to an end. Even those who believe that Kavanaugh belongs on the bench may be hard-pressed to disagree. Ventura County Sheriff’s Sergeant Ron Helus, who rushed into the Borderline Bar & Grill during a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, Calif., on Nov. 7, was no less valiant because he was killed by friendly fire. The late Senator John McCain, who refused to use his father’s connections to be released from a prison in Vietnam, was no less selfless because he was captured. Courage is not transactional. In coming before the American public for not quite 4½ hours, Ford was regarded as a hero not because of the results she delivered but because, in doing what she believed to be right, she reminded the rest of us how it’s done.

The magazine gave the title – which goes to the person they judge has been the most influential over the past year – to “the Guardians and the War on Truth”.  Those named also included the journalists killed in the mass shooting at the Capital Gazette in Maryland in June, two Reuters reporters jailed in Myanmar after investigating the massacre of Rohingya Muslims and Maria Ressa, a journalist in the Philippines facing tax evasion charges that she has called “political harassment”. The Guardians—Jamal Khashoggi, the Capital Gazette, Maria Ressa, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo—are TIME's Person of the Year 2018 #TIMEPOY https://t.co/HvoEaW5oUi pic.twitter.com/9Mr0wBTmvj “In its highest forms, influence – the measure that has for nine decades been the focus of Time’s Person of the Year – derives from courage. Like all human gifts, courage comes to us at varying levels and at varying moments,” Time magazine’s editor-in-chief, Edward Felsenthal, wrote in an essay about the selection. “This year we are recognizing four journalists and one news organization who have paid a terrible price to seize the challenge of this moment: Jamal Khashoggi, Maria Ressa, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo and the Capital Gazette of Annapolis, Md.” More than two months since Khashoggi’s disappearance, Saudi Arabia is still facing international condemnation over his brutal murder and alleged dismemberment at the hands of a Saudi hit team. The 61-year-old’s body has still not been found and is thought by Turkish investigators to have been dissolved in acid. Time magazine’s person of the year started in 1927 and recognizes “the person or group of people who most influenced the news and the world – for better or for worse – during the past year”. It is decided by the magazine’s editors. The journalists named are representative of many others facing serious risks to cover the stories of our time, the magazine said. Fifty-two journalists have been murdered in 2018. The magazine editor said the selection was particularly relevant amid an assault around the world and in the United States on freedom of the press. “It has long been the first move in the authoritarian playbook: controlling the flow of information and debate that is freedom’s lifeblood. And in 2018, the playbook worked. Today, democracy around the world faces its biggest crisis in decades,” Felsenthal wrote, calling the abuse and manipulation of the truth “an insidious and growing threat to freedom”. In choosing Khashoggi, Time for the first time in its history picked someone who is deceased as a person of the year. Felsenthal called him “the most visible representative of this harrowing year for truth”. The Washington Post columnist’s death has sparked a global reassessment of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and the west’s relationship with the repressive kingdom. Time also named Ressa, the founder and editor of Rappler, a news site in the Philippines known for its reporting on President Rodrigo Duterte’s extrajudicial killings. The government has sued her site repeatedly, and she has faced violent threats online. Five staffers at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, were murdered in June by a gunman angry about old coverage of him by the paper. The shooting made the US the fourth deadliest country in the world to be a journalist in 2018, tied with Mexico. “But while the loss was immense and intensely personal, that day the staff at one of the nation’s oldest news outlets did what it has done since before the American ­Revolution – they put the paper out,” Felsenthal wrote. The two young Reuters reporters, Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone, were sent to prison for reporting on the killings of 10 Rohingya Muslims. They were sentenced to seven years, while the killers they revealed got 10 years. The Reuters journalists also won two awards at the Press Gazette’s British Journalism Awards on Monday night, taking the prizes for best foreign affairs journalism and best overseas investigation for their work.“We are all in debt to reporters who are willing to put their liberty on the line in order to tell the world things the world needs to know about,” said the judges in the investigation category. “They investigated atrocities against Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims in the face of very significant opposition from the government, a government which up until then we had thought was run by a saint. Their work had a major impact on international opinion and was genuine world-changing journalism.” Time released four versions of its front page, featuring Khashoggi, Ressa, staffers at the Capital Gazette who survived the mass shooting and the wives of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. They noted there are plenty of other examples of embattled journalists this year, including Bangladeshi photographer Shahidul Alam, who was jailed for more than 100 days for criticizing the country’s prime minister, and freelance journalist Amal Habani in Sudan, who was arrested while covering a protest, detained for 34 days and beaten with electric rods. Jim Waterson contributed to this report This article was amended on 12 December 2018 to delete a reference to “freelance journalist Sheikh Hasina”. That should have been “freelance journalist Amal Habani”.",2018-12-11 08:18:14,Time magazine names Jamal Khashoggi and persecuted journalists 'person of the year',,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

          / CBS/AP Slain Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi and other journalists that Time magazine called ""the guardians"" were named Time's Person of the Year for 2018 on Tuesday. Khashoggi and the group were chosen over special counsel Robert Mueller, Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump, who were listed as finalists on Monday. Mr. Trump was named the first runner-up Tuesday. Mueller was the second runner-up. The other journalists named with Khashoggi were the Capital Gazette newspaper in Maryland, where five people were killed in a mass shooting earlier this year; imprisoned Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo; and Maria Ressa, founder and editor of a news site in the Philippines. Time recognizes the person or group of people who most influenced the news and the world ""for better or for worse"" during the past year. Khashoggi was killed two months ago. The journalist, who had lived in the U.S. and wrote for The Washington Post, had been critical of the Saudi regime. U.S. intelligence officials determined that Saudi security officials were most likely acting on orders from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman when they killed and dismembered Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Turkey. Mr. Trump, who views the crown prince as an ally, has been reluctant to accept the CIA's findings. ""His murder has prompted a global reassessment of the Saudi crown prince and a really long overdue look at the devastating war in Yemen,"" Time's Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal said on NBC's ""Today"" show. Khashoggi was the first deceased person named Person of the Year, Felsenthal said. Reesa is an award-winning Philippine journalist who, along with the online news service she heads, has been sued for tax evasion. Her website has been critical of the government of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, and she claims the charges are politically motivated. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been imprisoned for nearly a year in Myanmar after investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslims. In June, four journalists and a sales assistant were killed by a gunman at the Capital Gazette newspaper. In addition to Mr. Trump, Mueller and Putin, the magazine said six other finalists made its shortlist for this year.

A series of four covers included Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist and prominent Saudi critic who in October was brutally murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The staff of the Capital Gazette, five of whom were killed in a mass shooting in their newsroom in June, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Ootwo, two Reuters journalists detained in Myanmar, and Filipina journalist Maria Ressa were also named. During an appearance on Today, editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal noted that it was the magazine’s first time selecting a person who was no longer alive for its person of the year. “It’s also very rare that a person’s influence grows so immensely in death,” Felsenthal said, referring to Khashoggi. “His murder has prompted a global reassessment of the Saudi crown prince and a really long overdue look at the devastating war in Yemen.” “This ought to be a time when democracy leaps forward, an informed citizenry being essential to self-government,” Karl Vick, the author of the cover story, wrote. “Instead, it’s in retreat.” Vick went on to note the chilling effects of President Donald Trump’s ongoing attacks on the media, along with his embrace of authoritarian leaders. “In normal times, the U.S. news media is so much a part of public life that, like air, it’s almost impossible to make it out. But it has been made conspicuous—by the attacks and routine falsehoods of the President, by social-media behemoths that distribute news but do not produce it and by the emerging reality of what’s at stake.” “This is the first time we’ve chosen someone no longer alive as Person of the Year, but it’s also very rare that a person’s influence grows so immensely in death.” TIME Editor-in-Chief @efelsenthal talks Jamal Khashoggi’s 2018 Person of the Year cover pic.twitter.com/KTbgsK0AFt — TODAY (@TODAYshow) December 11, 2018  Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

150,https://themuse.jezebel.com/natalie-portman-isnt-supposed-to-play-a-bad-pop-star-in-1830986697,"Spoilers ahead. The last 12 or so minutes of Vox Lux undermine what preceded it like a cruel punchline. It’s a compressed concert, one of those big theatrical stadium shows with a vision, from our protagonist Celeste (played in this part of the movie by Natalie Portman) and it is here that the movie turns into amateur (quarter-) hour. This section of the film takes place in 2017 but Celste is wearing a kind of purple leotard that would have looked passé eight years before, like something Lady Gaga wouldn’t even deign to wear around the house. The backup singers waddle around like they’re doing a sketch-show parody of synchronized swimming, or maybe the kind of smirking performance that you could see at a PC Music showcase that’s smothered by so many layers of irony that whatever it’s trying to say is muffled. The songs, all written by Sia in her signature shriek-y style, sound like bad impressions of better songs she’s already sold to other artists. And then there is Celeste’s staggeringly mediocre performance. In what leads up to the climax, Celeste is made out to be a legend on the scale of Britney Spears, the kind of pop star who’s managed relevance as she slides toward her third decade in the industry. She doesn’t have a tablespoon of charisma, but even an ocean liner full of it couldn’t sell her flat, nasal whine that makes bad songs worse. Her choreography is not particularly intricate or challenging, but the performance is so imprecise and sloppy that I wondered watching it if Natalie Portman, who plays the older Celeste in the movie’s second half, just kind of winged it, perhaps hoping that the hubris of such methodology would translate onscreen as the more generalized hubris one needs to get up onstage in glitter and no pants and demand to be the center of attention in a full stadium for around two hours. It does not translate. And though the film’s gaze at this half-assed spectacle is unbroken, suggesting its writer-director Brady Corbet is in fact convinced of the excellence he’s depicting, it’s all so shoddy in a film that is otherwise calculated with the precision of a Madonna album/tour cycle. So stark is the contrast between the preceding 90 or so minutes and this stage show that I considered the possibility that Corbet was making an oblique rockist statement on the innate worthlessness of pop music. We spend so much time attempting to understand Celeste—the first half of the film shows her ascent to stardom at 14 (in this section, she’s played by Raffey Cassidy, who then transitions to playing Celeste’s daughter during the film’s second half, which takes place about 17 years later). Certainly, it struck me that I’d have a much harder time caring about the 2017 Celeste if I’d seen her perform before learning about what had come to make her tick. Maybe Corbet’s point, I thought, was that humanity is pure seductive spectacle and that pop music’s necessary compression and dumbing down of it means that the form is innately garbage. I don’t agree (not generally, although there are artists that make me reconsider my ostensible love of pop, and the list grows by the year), but I could see how someone who isn’t so invested would want to make that argument. Hell, I’ve heard it being made before. So vexing was this that I decided to ask Corbet directly. I’d seen the movie at a special screening in late November, attended by Corbet, who then sat for about 30 minutes in front of the audience, fielding the questions of a viewer and a moderator alongside his younger Celeste, Cassidy. I asked my friend who was sitting next to me if my question seemed overly shady. He said it did not, and so I raised my hand. “Brady, do you personally consider Celeste to be a good pop star?” I asked when called on. “Do you?” he asked back. “I think she’s a fascinating person,” I said, because that is what I thought. “I don’t know,” he said. “We really tried to make her a very good pop star. I asked Sia to make the music because I wanted the songs to be good.” He referenced the mixing of the music during the film’s 12-minute concert scene as a vague way of referencing why she may have not connected. The sound design of the scene I found about as perplexing as everything else in it—Celeste’s songs sound blown out and distorted as if you’re there in concert. Why is that? The actual filmmaking, with its several cameras and attendant exacting scope, is reminiscent of a televised concert like those that air on HBO. By the time those concerts make it to air, their sound has been pristinely mastered. Presenting the music in this way just makes enjoying it needlessly difficult. “The film is already so absurdist in its second half that it would have seemed, I don’t know, just mean spirited somehow, if she wasn’t talented,” Corbet continued. “But… asking a question like that, I’m not sure. I’m too close to it to answer whether any of the characters are even good people. I’m not sure.” For me, the final performance was such a letdown because I ate up everything the movie served for the prior 90 minutes. Vox Lux is one of several rock musicals to arrive this year—it joins a group including the overrated A Star Is Born, the critically underrated Bohemian Rhapsody, and the fairly dire Her Smell—and it’s the most satisfying of the four in many ways. If you generously interpret A Star Is Born as a sort of fairytale, its oversights are more forgivable and its broadness resembles an aesthetic choice. As though in direct conversation with a movie that was released just two months prior, Vox Lux offers you a vantage point that A Star Is Born is either too busy (if we’re being kind) or too inept (if we aren’t) to consider: The nuts-and-bolts construction of a pop star from the ground up. Vox Lux takes you into a dingy recording booth, a cavernous dance studio (where Celeste’s floppy-limbed ambition evidently supersedes innate talent), and a reserved hotel conference room that operates as a sort of celebrity holding tank during a press junket. Its first half suggests the development of musical competence and paints a plausible scenario from which a life stricken with tragedy could yield megastardom. There’s a breathtaking moment early on in Vox Lux where a song written by Celeste and her sister Ellie (Stacy Martin) transitions from an intimate piano-based ballad to a shattering wall of string-laden bombast that blares as Celeste, her sister, and her manager (played by Jude Law) walk down a New York street. She has arrived and the movie rather elegantly and efficiently shows and tells why. Even the minor inaccuracies didn’t disturb me. “Hologram,” which Celeste records early in her career and was the only Vox Lux song I left the theater wanting to hear again, contains sounds so trappy and a shape so EDM-my that it’s simply anachronistic that such a song would have been released around 2000. Further, its accompanying video, which strobes between Celeste riding on the back of a motorcycle driven by a guy in a glitter mask and the tunnel that they’re driving through, is way too arty for a 14-year-old teen pop star, especially one of the TRL era. Meanwhile, the film’s pronounced tonal shifts to and from extreme violence were thrilling—I felt their jarring nature on my body like G force. Corbet said that he conceived Vox Lux primarily in response to Apple News updates, which could inform you of a mass shooting and Ariana Grande’s decision to cut off her ponytail (his examples) within moments. “I think the juxtaposition of those things is… it’s not something that I had to create. It already exists,” he said. (I’m intentionally leaving out a discussion of the violence that contrasts with the star-making scenes so as not to spoil the earned surprises.) “And I think that it’s something very, very unique to our generation. And so, how we’re meant to cope with those things coexisting, receiving those headlines all at the same time. It struck me as something that was worth making a movie about.” Something else Corbet said during that Q&A, though, made me question just how well-versed in pop music he was. He referenced a scene in the movie’s second, Portman-driven half in which her sister threatens to come out as her ghostwriter, the unsung force behind her music. Celeste responds with indifference, saying that nobody would care. “If someone tomorrow morning said your favorite artist—shocker—collaborated with 27 people to write your favorite song, it wouldn’t be newsworthy. That’s interesting,” Corbet explained. “I think that for us to be robbed of our drama too, to be robbed of our fiction too, that’s very heavy. The film sort of wrestles with the notion that even clichés have been robbed from us. So what do you do? Where do you go from there?” He contrasted it with The Rose, which this year alone has shown itself to be far more influential and relevant than just about any year since its 1979 release. He believed such a revelation of the woman behind the curtain would have mattered then, in the late ’70s. I’m not quite convinced—Celeste’s brand is plastic pop, and her music doesn’t seem confessional in any meaningful way. Audiences perhaps hold some singers who write in higher esteem than those who don’t, but look at Whitney Houston, who amassed very few writing credits throughout her reign as a global icon, particularly during her mid-’80s-to-’90s peak. Look at Mariah Carey, who from her debut’s album press cycle, has underlined her songwriting only to go on, for years, to complain that this key aspect of her artistry has been unrecognized, disbelieved, or otherwise ignored. While that may have been personally frustrating, it never impeded her commercial prospects. As much as I enjoyed the majority of Vox Lux, it ultimately resembles a sort of self-own on the part of Corbet and especially Portman, who in retrospect, is just kind of bad in this movie, either over- or under-doing it, never quite hitting the right note. If only you could Autotune an acting performance. Hitting those notes, in fact, is what makes the difference between a superstar and a person aspiring to be one. Not everyone can be a pop star—this year’s rock bildungsromans remind us that such artists are in many ways superlative at least as workers, if not as humans, even when their flaws are ablaze. Vox Lux sometimes reinforces this idea straightforwardly, but when it does so inadvertently, it resonates loudest. THANK YOU for dragging the costume/art direction.

154,https://www.denverpost.com/2018/12/11/colorado-healing-fund-mass-shooting-victims/,"Trending: When Frank DeAngelis was principal of Columbine High School in 1999, schools didn’t have protocols for mass shootings. The only drills they conducted were for fires. And there was no mechanism, no playbook for supporting families after what was then an unimaginable tragedy. “Times have changed,” DeAngelis said. In a sign of the times, DeAngelis joined Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, Lt. Governor Donna Lynne and a host of community partners Tuesday morning to announce a new non-profit dedicated solely to helping victims of mass tragedy. The Colorado Healing Fund establishes a safe, secure way for the public to send money to support victims and their families after a mass casualty incident in the state. The attorney general’s office has provided $1 million in seed funding. “This is not something any of us want to think about,” Coffman said, “and we hope we don’t have to use this fund. But we owe it to Coloradoans to be prepared.” The fund will provide immediate and long-term assistance for victims, families and communities. The seed money will allow the organization to send money the day of or the day after a mass casualty event. The fund could provide medical treatment, food, housing and transportation for family members. The genesis of the fund started in 2016, Coffman said. But it gained steam after the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017, when Colorado sent personnel to assist in the response. The result is one statewide fund that aims to keep money flowing to victims, not bad actors. “We know from our experience that people here are very generous,” the attorney general said. “But this also creates the opportunity for scam and fraud.” Coffman contacted DeAngelis six months ago to see what he thought about the idea. “It was a no-brainer,” DeAngelis said about getting involved as a board member. “It would have made a big difference if we had something like this (after Columbine), ” he said. “If something had been in place then, it would have helped the healing.” Since Columbine, Colorado has seen a host of mass shootings. In December 2007, a 24-year-old man opened fire at two churches — Youth With a Mission in Arvada and New Life Church in Colorado Springs — killing four people and wounding five others. Five years later, 12 were killed and 70 injured in a shooting the Century Aurora 16 Theater. Then there was the 2015 Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado Springs, when a gunman killed three people, including a police officer. “I hope — I pray — we don’t have to use this fund,” DeAngelis said. “But odds are we will.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts",2018-12-11 15:35:58,"Cynthia Coffman, former Columbine principal introduce Colorado Healing Fund, a non-profit to help victims of mass tragedy",,390346,http://feeds.denverpost.com/dp-news-breaking

The publication also honored the founder of a Philippines news website critical of that country’s authoritarian government and a Maryland newspaper that was the target of a mass shooting, the first time in the magazine’s 95-year history that Time has bestowed the distinction on its own profession. A cover story highlighted the role of journalists, including Reuters’ Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who Myanmar imprisoned for violating a state secrets act, and Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi writer and critic of the nation’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was slain two months ago inside a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey. “I hope that this is received by the public at large far, far beyond the United States as a reminder of the importance of defending free expression and the pursuit of truth and facts,” Ben Goldberger, Time magazine’s assistant managing editor, said during an interview. “That is the baseline for all free societies. Democracy certainly cannot function without a shared understanding of the facts.” The annual distinction is intended to recognize the person, group or idea that had the greatest influence on world events that year. It has been given to a wide range of influencers, from U.S. civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. and Queen Elizabeth to Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, who was honored before the start of World War Two. Wednesday will mark one year since Reuters journalists Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were imprisoned for their work investigating the killing of villagers from Myanmar’s Muslim Rohingya minority by the country’s security forces and civilian mobs. They were convicted on Sept. 3 under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act in a case seen as a test of democratic freedoms in Myanmar. “We hope this recognition will draw continued awareness to their unjust arrest and imprisonment in Myanmar, and reaffirm the essential role of a free press around the world. Every day that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo remain in prison is an assault on press freedom,” said Reg Chua, the chief operating officer for Reuters editorial. Khashoggi was killed two months ago at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul when he went there to collect documents for his forthcoming marriage. He was the first person to be named a Time Person of the Year after his death. U.S. senators briefed by the Central Intelligence Agency have said they are certain that the Saudi crown prince was responsible for Khashoggi’s killing, a view U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is skeptical of. The crown prince has denied knowledge of the operation that killed Khashoggi. Time also honored Maria Ressa, the founder of the Philippine news site Rappler, which has been a frequent critic of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, and the staff of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, where a gunman shot and killed five people in June. Ressa and her site were charged with tax evasion by the Philippines’ justice department in November. The four groups were highlighted on four separate covers of the magazine, one of which features the wives of the imprisoned Reuters reporters embracing one another as they hold photos of their husbands. “Whether they have been denied their freedom or been brutally murdered, honoring their work speaking truth to power is essential at this critical time where reporters are under unprecedented threat across the globe,” said Margaux Ewen, the North America director for Reporters Sans Frontieres, or Reporters Without Borders.

The mass shooting, a rarity in Latin America's largest nation, happened right after the midday service had ended at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Campinas, a city about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of Sao Paulo. ""It's so sad,"" said Wilson Cassante, a press officer with the archdiocese. ""It's hard to imagine the pain this has caused."" Hours after paramedics were seen taking bodies and injured out of the church, authorities identified the shooter as 49-year-old Euler Fernando Grandolpho of Valinhos, a nearby city in the densely populated state of Sao Paulo. Grandolpho, a systems analyst, was not a member of the church, authorities said. According to public records, Grandolpho had held various jobs with government entities, including a stint as an assistant to the prosecutor in the public ministry in Sao Paulo. Authorities said they had not identified a motive. A backpack found near the dead gunman had his identification but no note or other clues, police investigator Jose Henrique Ventura told reporters outside the church. ""Thanks to the intervention of police, something much bigger was avoided,"" said Ventura, adding that the four injured were in stable condition. Danielle Coutinho told EPTV that she was sitting in the church chatting after Mass when the shooting began. A man sitting close to her was shot as she and others ran. ""I saw people getting shot. I can't get it out of my head,"" she said in tears. ""It was horrible."" Brazil has long struggled with gun violence, and is routinely the world leader in total homicides. Last year, nearly 64,000 people were killed. President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain, campaigned on promises to crack down on violence, in part by loosening gun laws so more civilians could arm themselves. Still, mass shootings like those in the United States are unusual. Hamilton Caviola Filho, a police investigator, told news portal G1 that authorities had reviewed surveillance footage from inside the cathedral. The shooter ""came into the church, sat on a pew, with time to think, and then got up and starting shooting,"" said Caviola Filho. The investigator also said that before shooting himself in the head, the suspect took a bullet in the ribs from responding police. In total, the suspect fired at least 20 shots, said Caviola Filho. Father Amaury Thomazi, who celebrated Mass before the shooting, posted a video recounting the chaos that followed the burst of gunfire. ""Nobody could do anything or help in any way"" to stop the rampage, Thomazi said, calling on people to pray for the dead, the injured and the shooter.

Unfortunately, not everyone else was as excited as he was, and some mistook his enthusiasm as evidence that he was preparing to do something violent. The unnamed student drew a circle on a whiteboard in his classroom toward the end of November this year, with a black cross intersecting inside the middle of the circle, according to reporting from BuzzFeed News. The student also wrote, ""Dec. 7th, Time to"" with the drawing of the logo completing the sentence. After witnessing the boy drawing the logo two days in a row in the last days of last month, four students who saw him doing so took their concerns to the school's principal, Kerry Matheny. It turns out, their worries were all over a video game, and the boy's excitement for its release date. The logo the boy drew, as he explained it to Matheny, was from the popular video game Super Smash Bros., produced by Nintendo. The date he wrote next to the logo was the release date for the game on the company's newest console, the Switch. The student expressed regret, stating that he ""did not mean to cause an alarm"" over his genuine excitement for the game's release That conversation was enough for Matheny to be satisfied, and she relayed the explanation to the students who brought their concerns. Unfortunately, rumors had already started permeating the school, and students had already assumed the worst: that the boy who drew the logo was planning a mass shooting on December 7.Rumors swirled about a potential school shooting at an Ohio high school after a student wrote a Super Smash Bros. logo on a white board, which his classmates misinterpreted as a threathttps://t.co/6NyBHTtHfo— BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) December 11, 2018On Wednesday last week, the school district's superintendent sent an email to parents with students in the school explaining to them that there wasn't such a threat from the student in question.

Police are investigating a handwritten note threatening violence at the university and a nearby high school, both about a 30-mile drive from the site of the Thousand Oaks shooting in November. The president of California State University, Northridge said authorities believe there is no imminent threat to campus and did not plan to close the campus Wednesday, the first day of fall semester finals. While the university has increased police patrols for the week, professors have been required to provide alternative test options for students who don't want to be on campus. ""We recognize that these threats have created an environment where students and other members of our campus community fear for their safety,"" CSUN President Dianne F. Harrison said in a statement. Still, some students said the university's accommodations were not enough, with many expressing concerns on social media. By late Tuesday, more than 13,000 signed a Change.org petition to close campus. On Twitter, students responded to the president's statement with requests to make all finals online. The stress of the threats, several said, will prevent students from focusing on finals on campus after the day of the shooting threats, too. Harrison updated the campus Tuesday evening, announcing finals Wednesday will not be taken in person. Exams on Thursday through Dec. 18 will also be offered in alternative formats ""to further ease the anxiety students are understandably experiencing."" Professors cannot penalize students for requesting accommodations, she said, as officials made the decision for student success. The campus will stay open until the end of the semester, however. Police found the note late Monday night, less than a week after they began investigating a shooting threat written on the walls of another campus building, according to campus messages. The first threat shared with the community on Dec. 5 accompanied hateful and racist language, but did not include Northridge Academy High School as a target. Both messages threatened a shooting on Dec. 12, the first in Sierra Hall and the second across campus. Police believe the two threats are separate, said university spokesperson Carmen Ramos Chandler. Before the second threat was found, students and parents had already urged university administration to close campus through emails, according to a campus message on Monday. Some professors had adjusted requirements by then, too. #CSUN . . .

162,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/briefing/strasbourg-brexit-the-arctic.html,"Advertisement Supported by Let us help you start your day. By Penn Bullock (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Thank you for all the feedback on our special Brexit section of the briefing over the last week. You may have noticed some other changes — we’ve been working on ways to make the briefing even better. Please let us know what you think. Now, on to the news: A no-confidence vote is planned for Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, there was a possible terrorist shooting in the French city of Strasbourg, and the Arctic is on track for its second-warmest year on record. Here’s the latest: Britain’s beleaguered prime minister faces a no-confidence vote today, after 48 lawmakers from her Conservative Party submitted letters of protest, posing a new and potentially lethal threat to her leadership. Under the party’s rules, Mrs. May needs to win 158 votes from among the 315 Conservative members of Parliament to stay as party leader and therefore prime minister. If she does so, then party members cannot mount another challenge to her leadership for a year, but if she loses the vote, then she withdraws and another leader will be chosen over the coming weeks. If you missed it yesterday: Mrs. May toured European capitals, seeking concessions to try to salvage her agreement on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union a day after postponing a parliamentary vote on it. But European leaders expressed resistance to further negotiations. “There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission. A telling scene: Some saw a metaphor when Mrs. May was briefly stuck in her car in Germany. The Daily: On the podcast, our correspondents in London discuss the Brexit fiasco. An armed man previously flagged as a threat by the French authorities opened fire in Strasbourg, France, at the country’s largest Christmas market, killing at least three people and wounding a dozen others before fleeing amid mass panic. A terrorism investigation was opened, the city center was closed off and residents were warned to stay home as a manhunt began. Broad challenges: European leaders gathering this week in Brussels for an end-of-the-year summit meeting will confront a new kind of business as usual: constant turmoil. It’s not just the concerns over terrorism or Brexit. Mass protests in France have dashed hopes for a handoff of pan-European leadership from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Populism is still potent, and the E.U. also faces a fraying alliance with the U.S., a budget fight with Italy, Russian aggression, increasing authoritarianism in Hungary and Poland, and shaky or coalition-less parliaments across the bloc. Yellow Vests: A month of turmoil has left Mr. Macron’s economic agenda in doubt, and has so far cost the country’s economy an estimated $11.4 billion. Mr. Macron’s proposed relief package for the working and middle classes is estimated to cost about the same, but doubts have emerged about how much it would help. Members of the Yellow Vest movement called for more protests this weekend. The Arctic has been warmer over the last five years than at any time since records began in 1900, and the region is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet, according to a report by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. An official with the agency said that increasing air and ocean temperatures were “pushing the Arctic into uncharted territory.” Impact: The warming is shrinking sea ice and wreaking havoc on Arctic life and on weather around the world, the report found. For example, a bitter cold spell in Europe early this year is attributed to a jet stream slackened by warmer Arctic air. Other effects: By midcentury, cargo ships may be able to pass directly over the North Pole, even under moderate warming. The president, in an extraordinary public altercation at the White House on Tuesday, vowed to block full funding for the government if Democrats refused to finance his promised border wall. On Twitter, he said the military could work on building the “Great Wall” whether Congress funded it or not — which would not be legal. The testy back-and-forth in the Oval Office with the Democrats’ congressional leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi, above left, and Senator Chuck Schumer, right, heightened concern that the two sides might not reach an agreement on spending bills to keep the government running by a Dec. 21 deadline. The issue: Mr. Trump wants $5 billion for the wall, but the administration has yet to spend much of the $1.3 billion Congress approved for border security last year. The confrontation: Ms. Pelosi, the prospective speaker of the House when Democrats take control in January, met the president in verbal combat. “Don’t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting,” she told him. Here are five takeaways from the fracas, and video of the sparring. Chinese tensions with Washington... : A cyberattack on the Marriott hotel chain in September that collected personal details on roughly 500 million guests was part of a sweeping Chinese intelligence-gathering effort in the U.S., according to two people briefed on the preliminary results of an investigation into the hacking. The development could throw a wrench into U.S.-China trade talks. ... and with Canada: A former Canadian diplomat was detained in China, less than a week after Canada announced the arrest of a senior Chinese executive, Meng Wanzhou of the tech giant Huawei. Ms. Meng has been granted bail while awaiting extradition to the U.S. Seven-hour spacewalk: Two Russian astronauts took to the vacuum of space from the International Space Station to examine a small, mysterious hole that the Russian government says it believes was drilled into a Soyuz spacecraft in an act of sabotage. Though the hole poses no danger, wild speculation has run through the Russian news media blaming NASA at the same time that Russia is trying to persuade the U.S. to extend their space alliance. Google in the hot seat: The company’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, testified on Capitol Hill, fielding questions from U.S. lawmakers on topics like the company’s market power, whether it deliberately suppressed conservative content and its protection of privacy.

A heated session of British Parliament turned to chaos on Monday night when a member of the House of Commons grabbed a five-foot, silver-gilt mace, as seen below, and tried to leave the chamber. The mace represents the crown’s authority, and Parliament can’t sit or pass laws without it. Traditionally, the person in charge of guarding the mace — and restoring order in rare mace-snatchings — is the sergeant-at-arms. The sergeant’s role, which dates to 1415, is to escort the speaker of the House before each sitting, carrying the mace during the procession, and to maintain order during the sitting. You can’t miss the sergeant — the traditional uniform sports a frilly lace collar and cuffs, silk stockings and black patent shoes. The sword also comes in handy. After Monday’s breach of protocol, the troublemaking lawmaker said: “They stopped me before I got out of the chamber and I wasn’t going to struggle with someone wearing a huge sword on their hip.” Alisha Haridasani Gupta wrote today’s Back Story.

163,https://www.bustle.com/p/trump-responds-to-the-strasbourg-attack-by-calling-for-border-funding-but-hes-missing-something-15513188,"News  On Tuesday evening, a gunman opened fire at Strasbourg, France's famous Christmas market, killing at least two. In his first tweet about the situation, President Donald Trump reacted to Strasbourg's attack by calling for border funding in the United States. He's deep in a fight with parts of Congress to add that funding to year-end budget bills âÂ but by drawing a comparison to this mass shooting, he's missing something big. ""Another very bad terror attack in France,"" Trump wrote on Wednesday. ""We are going to strengthen our borders even more. Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!"" French authorities are saying that the suspected attacker was born in Strasbourg, according to The Independent. Because he was born in France, additional border security to prevent illegal immigration in France would not have stopped him. Many of those who have carried out mass shootings in the United States âÂ including those in Parkland, Thousand Oaks, and Tallahassee â were U.S. citizens. Strasbourg's suspected attacker has previously served jail time in both France and Germany, and he was kept on a government national security threat watchlist, per the BBC. Some of his neighbors have told the Associated Press that they believe his time in prison ""destabilized"" him. The suspect began shooting next to the Christmas market â which is highly popular and the oldest in the country â around 8 p.m. local time, per the BBC. According to The New York Times, he killed two people and injured a dozen others with both a gun and a knife. One was left brain dead and six more had serious wounds, Paris terrorism prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz announced on Wednesday (French authorities have opened a terrorism investigation). ""He had been incarcerated multiple times,"" Heitz said of the suspect, ""and was known to the prison administration for his radicalization and his proselytizing attitude."" Police are currently searching for the 29-year-old. He reportedly fled the area in a taxi and exchanged gunfire with law enforcement, but has so far managed to evade capture. The French Deputy Interior Minister said it's possible he escaped the country, per the BBC. Antonio Tajani, the head of the European Parliament (which meets in Strasbourg) spoke out about the shooting on Tuesday, calling it ""a criminal attack against peace, against democracy, against our model of life,"" per the AP. In a Tuesday night tweet, he also expressed ""all [his] sorrow"" at the incident. Trump's response took on a different tone. Rather than linger on the tragedy itself, the U.S. president's Wednesday tweet referenced a conversation he had with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leaders in Congress, the day before. During that meeting, the president threatened to shut down the government if he doesn't receive the funding he wants for border security, per the AP. Studies suggest that immigrants to the United States âÂ and particularly undocumented immigrants âÂ commit crimes at lower rates than citizens. According to the BBC, the Strasbourg shooting suspect's motive is not yet clear.

164,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/12/gun-control-activist-david-hogg-parkland-people-dying,"The students of Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, reached global prominence with the March for Our Lives protest. One of the activists explains why the school shooting must never be forgotten Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.13 BST On 1 February 1960, 17-year-old Franklin McCain and three black friends went to the whites-only counter at Woolworths in Greensboro, North Carolina and took a seat. The humiliation of growing up black in the south had left the teenage McCain contemplating suicide. Having spent the previous night chastising the older generation for their failure to effectively confront segregation, the four young men had talked themselves into an act that was brave, reckless, exhilarating and, ultimately, liberating. “We wanted to go beyond what our parents had done,” McCain told me almost four decades later. “The worst thing that could happen was that the Ku Klux Klan could kill us … but I had no concern for my personal safety. The day I sat at that counter, I had the most tremendous feeling of elation and celebration. I felt that, in this life, nothing else mattered … If there’s a heaven, I got there for a few minutes. I just felt you can’t touch me, you can’t hurt me. There’s no other experience like it.”  Listening to David Hogg, the 18-year-old former high school student who became an internationally known gun-control campaigner after a gunman shot dead 17 students and staff and injured 17 others at his school in Parkland, Florida, reminds me of McCain’s account of his protest. Fearless, relentless, passionate, earnest and old beyond his years yet brimming with youthful intensity. A teenager who, having already entertained his own mortality, has become recklessly audacious and singlemindedly driven. Will he go to college next year? “I don’t feel comfortable going to college until we have at least $50m to fund gun violence research annually,” he says. Has he had time to grieve? “I can’t sit back and grieve while so many people are dying.” What’s the difference between the gun control efforts he is involved in and previous attempts that have not succeeded? “We are young and we are not going to leave it to a generation of corrupt politicians to decide our future.” Hogg has the interview manner of a person who is more used to answering questions than listening to them. It would be easy to lampoon him. But it would also be ungenerous. He is young, his sister lost four of her friends in the shooting, and he was unexpectedly thrust into the public eye. He is also dyslexic and didn’t learn to read until he was nine. His mother told New York magazine that the challenges of those early years account for his declarative manner. “He gets absorbed in his words because he’s been doubted so much,” she says. “He needs to overcompensate when he’s arguing.” When I ask what side of his personality the media portrayals fail to catch he passes the phone to his two friends. “There’s a goofball side of him,” says one. “They portray him as a stern hard-arse – and he is sometimes. But that’s not who he is all the time.” At the beginning of the year, he wanted to be a journalist or an aerospace engineer. For the past eight months, thanks to a tragedy not of his making, he has become a high-profile figure in a media culture where certainty is valued far more than clarity or nuance. He was applying for colleges. Now he is being offered six- or seven-figure salaries by media outlets and nonprofit organisations and receiving invitations for paid speaking gigs at universities that rejected him. Since he started speaking out about gun control, he has been the subject of several threats on his life and, at times, has been accompanied by a security detail. (Facts he would rather not discuss.) Hogg divides his short life into before the shooting and after. Before: a debate team geek with a handful of friends. “I was not popular at all and I wasn’t an extrovert. And I’m still not: I’m an introvert, I like to keep to myself.” After: a constant media presence and tireless campaigner with more than 900,000 Twitter followers. That transformative moment lasted just a few minutes. Nicholas Cruz, 19, arrived at the Stoneman Douglas high school at 2.19pm with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle and several magazines and soon started shooting indiscriminately. The shooting lasted six minutes. Before the hour was out, Cruz had left the school with fleeing students. He went to Walmart, Subway and McDonald’s. The first time many of his fellow students met Hogg, the shooter was still at large and Hogg’s angular face was lit as though for a Hitchcock movie: a wide-eyed glare peering from a dark place. He had heard the gunfire and been herded, with several other students, into what looks like an unlit cupboard to hide. In the midst of this terror, he narrates the scene on his phone to an audience that has yet to exist. “Right now, we’re in a school,” he whispers, affecting the cadence of a war reporter. “An active shooter. It’s not a drill.” He goes on to interview fellow students before launching a political broadside: “The fact that school shootings have happened so much to the point that we need drills for them almost as much as fire drills is unacceptable. I call on legislators of this country to take action and stop this from happening.” For Hogg, the shift to advocacy was not simply immediate, it was simultaneous. He went to school a nerd and turned himself a national advocate as the event was happening. A few days later, while the political class was still talking “thoughts and prayers”, his classmate Emma Gonzalez “called BS” on the entire establishment regarding gun control. Hogg and Gonzalez knew each other from astronomy club, where they worked together the year before on an experimental weather balloon. The vehemence with which they, and other students, protested against lax gun laws in the immediate wake of the shooting roused a dormant constituency. When reporting for my book about all the children and teens shot dead in one random day in the US, I asked each family who lost a child an open-ended question: what did they think had made the tragedy possible? Not one mentioned guns. When I asked the more leading question, of what they thought about guns, most had an opinion: they were too easily accessible. They just didn’t think anything could be done about it. In the few weeks after Parkland, the learned hopelessness around the prospect of gun control seemed to have been replaced by a sense of urgency, militancy and indignation that had been sorely lacking. Hogg was not yet a teenager when the shootings at Sandy Hook happened in 2012. Neither he, nor his fellow students, had yet learned to be hopeless. Hogg says one of the key reasons the shootings at Parkland produced a broader and bigger response than other school mass shootings was timing and agency. “We spoke up immediately after the shooting,” he says. “For the first time we heard the witnesses and the victims of the mass murder tell their own story. We spoke out against it in a particular way.” The other, he says, is that those who were affected were relatively affluent and mostly white. “If our school had been in a different zip code, we wouldn’t have got the same coverage.” Hogg’s father was an FBI agent (and is a Republican) and his mother (a Democrat) is a teacher. How does he navigate the fact that he has become a prominent advocate in a cause that has a disproportionate impact on black and brown communities living in poverty? “I acknowledge it, in the first place,” he says. “I don’t know what it’s like to be discriminated against. I can empathise, but I can’t sympathise. So then I, literally and metaphorically, hand over the mic to someone who does.” The uncompromising rhetoric after Parkland triggered a wave of protests. There were school walk outs that involved millions of students and die-ins outside the White House and elsewhere. Hogg was one of the speakers on March for Our Lives, a demonstration in Washington called by another Parkland student – the third-biggest demonstration in US history – that took place less than six months after the shooting. The protest figureheads also drew significant opposition. Hogg and some of his fellow student leaders were accused, by the rightwing echo chamber, of being “crisis actors” – trained dramatists putting on a show for the cameras for political purposes. A rumour raced through the internet claiming that Hogg wasn’t even at the school when the shooting happened and that the video he put together was a fake. Days after March for Our Lives, his public profile soared further as he faced down the ultra-conservative Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham, who mocked Hogg on Twitter after he was rejected by four colleges. Hogg hit back, calling on advertisers to boycott Ingraham’s show. Advertisers duly pulled out. Ingraham apologised. Hogg refused to accept her apology. The advertisers have stayed away – and her ratings have gone up. From then until now, Hogg has barely stopped. He led a mass die-in at a supermarket chain that contributed to a Florida gubernatorial candidate who took money from the National Rifle Association (NRA). Over the summer, some survivors from Stoneman Douglas took a bus tour across the country – 75 cities over two months – in a bid to register young voters. Hogg believes that the results in the recent US midterms, where he cast his first vote in a general election, speak for themselves. “We had the largest youth turnout in history,” he says. “We promoted youth engagement all over and had one of the largest protests in American history.” It is true that November saw a record number of young people vote in a midterm election. But it’s also true that, at around 31%, the number still lagged significantly behind all other age groups. At the time of writing, there have been 296 mass shootings – where more than one person was killed or wounded – since Parkland, 25 of which have been in Florida. And gun policy was the fourth most important issue for voters (after healthcare, immigration and the economy) even though there was a mass shooting in a synagogue 10 days before polling day. For all the hard work the activists had put into their home state, it wasn’t enough to tip the balance in Florida, where voters sent one gun-loving Republican to the Senate and another to the governor’s mansion. Hogg shifts register from advocate to politician, advising against impatience and frustration. “Change takes a lot of time,” he says. “We are not always going to be 100% successful.” He believes the primary, if not sole, obstacle to change has been the main gun lobby, the NRA. The gun-control movement was cowered by them, he says. “Some [gun-control] organisations wouldn’t even talk about the NRA because they were afraid,” he says. “Democrats and Republicans were afraid of the NRA. We have to make it so that it pays for you to stand against the NRA and that you pay if you stand with the NRA.” Meanwhile, the population at large has been duped by them, he says. “In the 50s, two thirds of Americans thought having a gun in your house made you less safe. Now, two thirds think it makes you more safe. That’s NRA propaganda. Their success has been in convincing people that they have no power to change anything.” He believes the movement’s main task is not so much to change people’s minds as to make them hear and understand the case they are making. “They don’t understand what we stand for. They think we want to take away their guns, and we are not advocating taking guns away. A majority of people already believe in gun reform.” That’s true. And yet Hogg’s reasoning seems to assign a little too much credit to the NRA and too little to the agency of American people. In 2013, after Sandy Hook, polling showed gun owners were almost twice as likely as non–gun owners to have contacted a public official about gun policy, and almost three times as likely to have donated to a group that takes a position on the issue. When the national narrative is underpinned by self-reliance, rugged individualism, masculinity, conquering, dominating, force and power, the NRA may simply be better positioned to tap into attachment to mythologies than any logical argument about “common-sense gun reform” made by the other side. On the evening of the Parkland shooting, before the Twitter spat, Hogg went on Ingraham’s show. Just as she was drawing his segment to an end, he interjected: “Can I say one more thing to the audience? I don’t want this just to be another mass shooting. I don’t want this to be something that people forget.” I put it to him that Parkland has not been forgotten. But that it has perhaps become another mass shooting that people remember, like Newtown or Columbine – a punctuation point in a story that doesn’t change. How is this possible? “People forget and they move on,” he says. “It says a lot about our country.”",2018-12-12 08:59:45,What happened next: how teenage shooting survivor David Hogg became a political leader,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Two people were killed, one person is brain dead and a dozen others were injured in the shooting Tuesday night, prosecutor Remy Heitz said at a news conference. Police have deployed about 350 officers in the manhunt Wednesday for the suspect whom the prosecutor identified as Cherif C., following a common practice in France for authorities to provide only an initial for a suspect's family name. The Associated Press and Reuters have reported his last name is Chekatt. The 29-year-old Chekatt has a lengthy criminal record with 27 offenses and has previously served jail time in France, Germany, and Switzerland. Chekatt was radicalized in prison and was monitored by French intelligence services since his release in late 2015 on suspicion he was a religious extremist, the AP reported, citing a French interior ministry official. Four people close to the suspect have been detained but Chekatt has yet to be caught. Witnesses told police the suspect yelled ""Allahu Akbar"" (Arabic for ""God is great"") as he fired into the crowd near the Christmas market shortly before 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET). Strasbourg considers itself the ""capital of Christmas,"" with its holiday market attracting millions of tourists each year. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner had said the suspect exchanged shots with police after fleeing the area of the shooting late Tuesday. He got into a taxi and the driver later told officers he appeared to be injured, Heitz said. Hours before the shooting Tuesday, police had searched the suspect's home in a burglary probe and in the belief that Chekatt has alleged criminal association with a terrorist group and attempted an assassination. Police uncovered weapons, including a grenade and four knives in the raid, Heitz said. Strasbourg sits on the French border with Germany. On Wednesday, the German government stepped up border controls in response to the attack, but did not change the security threat level for the country.

Executive Editor The boyfriend of an Ohio woman who allegedly worshipped mass murderers like Dylann Roof and plotted a massacre was charged Wednesday with lying to the FBI, authorities said. A criminal complaint says Vincent Armstrong, 23, initially told investigators that he and girlfriend Elizabeth Lecron, 23, were “role-playing” when they talked about killing people—but later admitted it had “crossed over” from fantasy to reality and had started prepping for an attack. Armstrong was taken into custody two days after the feds arrested Lecron. She told an informant working for the FBI that the two of them had hatched a plan to commit “upscale mass murder” at a Toledo bar, according court papers filed this week. She and Armstrong also wrote about their urge to carry out violent attacks in disturbing journal entries seized by the feds and on their Tumblr accounts. “Around 5 a.m., I called [Subject-1],” Lecron wrote in May, referring to Armstrong. “He told me he felt homicidal. He had followed a car, wanting to murder. Didn’t happen but it worried me. I just told him ‘soon.’” A few weeks later, Armstrong wrote that he was haunted by “a vision to kill.” “To hunt the unwilling. These peasants to society. The hatred toward the human race is bewildering,” he wrote. “It makes me feel good to know I will end it all. Very soon. I am buying a knife this weekend to slay my pray [sic].” In another entry, he said he had bought caps for pipe bombs. “Soon we will bring destruction on society,” he threatened. The journal entries were detailed in a 19-page criminal complaint that laid bare Lecron’s alleged blood lust—including her correspondence with Roof, who is behind bars for carrying out the 2015 Charleston church massacre; a visit to Columbine High School, the site of a 1999 mass shooting; and a Tumblr account full of mass-murderer worship so foul it was taken down by the company only to be replaced by a similar one. According to the complaint, Lecron expressed admiration for a host of mass killers, boasting that she had written to 1979 school shooter Brenda Spencer and posted photos of Crimean school shooter Vladislav Roslyakov and human remains inside the house of a Prussian cannibal. But she appeared particularly obsessed with the Columbine killers and Roof. In August, she and Armstrong flew to Colorado, and she was caught taking photos on the campus, according to the complaint. She wrote about the visit on her Tumblr. “Lecron posted her next trip would be to Charleston to visit ‘the church,’” the complaint says, adding that it’s believed she was referring to the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston where white supremacist Roof murdered nine black people. In July, Lecron wrote to Roof in prison and asked him for reading suggestions, signing her note with a drawing of a flower and a ribbon and the words, “Best wishes,” according to the complaint. Authorities said Roof has only every responded to four people who have written to him, but Lecron was one of them. He asked her to send him books about civil uprising and the Nazis, and she obliged, sending him a book about a Belgian who fought for the Nazis. “Stay strong, Storm,” she wrote to him. “You have a lot of people who care for you beyond those walls.” Lecron told the FBI informant that Roof had written to her four times. “Super cool,” she said. The informant introduced Lecron to undercover agents posing as like-minded extremists who began discussing with her possibility of an attack. Soon after, she agreed to buy components of a bomb to blow up a pipeline, authorities said.",2018-12-12 11:05:35,Boyfriend of Accused Terrorist Vincent Armstrong Said Murder Plot Was ‘Role Playing’,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
168,http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/07/25/norway.terror.attacks/index.html,"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Norway's prime minister pledged that his country would remain ""an open society"" in the wake of Friday's massacre in Oslo and a nearby youth camp but said the bloodshed has changed the nation. ""I think that I will never be able to explain it fully to myself how this could happen, the horror that so many people experienced at that island on Friday,"" Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg told CNN. Authorities revised the death toll from Friday's attacks to 76 on Monday -- eight in a bombing at the Oslo building that houses Stoltenberg's offices, the rest at a summer camp run by his ruling Labour Party. A 32-year-old suspect has acknowledged carrying out the attacks but said they were necessary to prevent the ""colonization"" of the country by Muslims, a judge said Monday. ""I think that this will change Norway,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We'll have a Norway before and a Norway after the bomb and the killings."" But he added, ""Even after these terrible incidents, (Norway) will be an open society."" Nearly 200,000 people participated in a memorial Monday in downtown Oslo to honor the victims, authorities said. Trains were halted as part of a nationwide observance to remember the victims of Friday's slaughter, and Oslo Mayor Fabian Stang said the turnout showed that Norwegians do not accept violence. ""Today, people turned out to show that this town is ours and we don't accept this,"" he told CNN. The suspect, Anders Behring Breivik, accused the Labour Party of ""treason"" for promoting multiculturalism, Judge Kim Heger said after a closed hearing Monday. According to Heger, Breivik also said that he worked with two cells to launch the attacks, the deadliest attack in Norway since World War II. Police refused to comment on the claim, but a police official said Breivik appeared ""very calm"" during his hearing. ""He was very concise in trying to explain why he was trying to do this,"" the official said. Sveinung Sponheim, Norway's acting National Police chief, said Sunday that Breivik had told investigators he acted alone and was not aided in the planning of the attacks. He has pleaded not guilty, and two court psychiatrists will be assigned to the case, police said. Monday's hearing was closed to the public for ""security reasons and because of a concern that it would impede the investigation,"" court communications director Irene Ramm told CNN. Afterward, Heger told reporters that he had ordered that Breivik remain in custody for eight weeks until his next scheduled court appearance. The reported toll was as high as 93 over the weekend before being revised downward Monday. A police official said some victims may have been counted twice -- but officials predicted the toll could rise again, as investigators continued to search in and around the camp on Utoya Island for victims. Among those killed on the island was Trond Berntsen, the step-brother of Crown Princess Mette-Marit, according to a statement released by the Royal House Communications Office. At least four people remained unaccounted for Monday night, with investigators searching nearby waters for victims who may have drowned trying to escape the shooter. Breivik appears to have written a 1,500-page manifesto that rants against Muslims and lays out meticulous plans to prepare for the attacks. In it, he vilifies Stoltenberg and the Labour Party, accusing it of perpetuating ""cultural Marxist/multiculturalist ideals"" and indoctrinating youth with those ideals. The author accuses the Labour Party of embracing those ideals and allowing the ""Islamification of Europe."" CNN has not independently confirmed that Breivik is the author of the manifesto, which bears his name and says it is intended to be circulated among sympathizers. The writer rails against Muslims and their growing presence in Europe and calls for a European civil war to overthrow governments, end multiculturalism and execute ""cultural Marxists."" It contains photographs of Breivik wearing what appears to be a military uniform that features an altered U.S. Marine Corps dress jacket with medals of the Knights Templar -- an order of Christian Crusaders who helped fight against Muslim rule of the Holy Land in the Middle Ages, but which was shut down 700 years ago. Breivik asked to wear a uniform to the hearing but was not allowed to, Heger said. Heger said he ordered Breivik held in isolation for the next four weeks to ensure he has no opportunity to tamper with evidence, Heger said. The suspect has access to his lawyer but to no one else, and not to letters or news, court officials said. Police spokesman Henning Holtaas told CNN that the suspect was charged with two acts of terrorism, one for the bombing and one for the mass shooting. In Norway, which does not have the death penalty, the maximum sentence for such a charge is 21 years. However, the court could impose an extension, if the person were deemed still to be a threat after having served the sentence, he said. According to the Norwegian newspaper VG, which cited unidentified sources, Breivik told investigators during interviews that he belonged to a revived Knights Templar. He described the organization as an armed Christian order, fighting to rid the West of Islamic suppression, the newspaper said. Holtaas declined to confirm the news report, which mirrors statements in the manifesto. Breivik's lawyer, Geir Lippestad, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his client had expected to be tortured by police and shot during Monday's court proceeding. Breivik is prepared to spend the rest of his life in jail, his attorney said. But Stang had a different fate in mind: ""We're going to punish him with democracy and love,"" the Oslo mayor told CNN.

I sprinkle Yiddish into my speech, and for as long as I can remember, my family has replaced a post-sneeze âbless youâ with an automatic âyouâre so good-looking,â a reference to a Seinfeld joke. The chicken soup is key. Maybe itâs a stereotype, but itâs true â nobody can make chicken soup like my grandma does. Every holiday dinner during my childhood began with a bowl of it. Her broth is hearty and bursting with flavor, and she ladles in either matzo balls or dumplings called kreplach. Ever since I left home in the Boston suburbs and moved to New York for college seven years ago, Iâve spent fewer holidays with my family. Since meeting my boyfriend Saul last year, Iâve started celebrating holidays with his family in Brooklyn. While my family is Ashkenazi (Jews descended from Eastern and Central Europe), Saulâs is Sephardic (Jews from the Middle East with ancestors from Spain). There are a few cultural differences between us, one of which is food. When I joined them for Rosh Hashanah in September, I loved trying all sorts of dishes that were new to me, like stuffed grape leaves and black-eyed peas. But halfway through dinner, I realized what I was missing. There was no chicken soup. And suddenly, surrounded by a lively family and a delicious meal, I felt homesick. Over the next two weeks, I ordered chicken soup from three different restaurants, but none tasted as good as Grandmaâs. Each bowl of soup made me feel farther away from home than before. I had always assumed that my future kids and grandkids would grow up on homemade chicken soup like I did. But as my grandma ages and as I begin to spend more holidays with my boyfriend's family instead of my own, I realize that if I want chicken soup in my life, Iâm going to have to make it. Traditions donât live on forever unless you carry them on. On a Friday afternoon in November, I dial my grandparents to learn how to make the soup. My grandma keeps a box of yellowing index cards in her kitchen; theyâre mostly handwritten recipes dating back decades shuffled in with notes from 1964 tracking how many ounces of milk my mom, then a newborn, drank every day. For years now, Grandma has told me the recipe box would be mine someday. But instead of retrieving the recipe card from her box, she immediately fires it off from memory. âItâs very easy, a one-dish supper,â she begins. (Suppah â I love her accent dearly.) âGet a whole chicken. It can be in quarters. Make sure itâs clean. Put it in a pot with a whole onion. You add lots of celery, cut into pieces. Lots of carrot, cut into pieces. Then some parsnip, which gives a little sweetness to the soup. You can put in a piece or two, nothing much.â She calls out to my grandpa, who I imagine is sitting in his regular spot in the living room while she sits in the kitchen. âDid I get everything, Jerry?â I hear his muffled shouts about salt and pepper, but she doesnât mention anything. âCover it with water, or more than cover it,â she continues. âWhen it starts to boil, you go back to the pot and scrub off any scum that comes up from the chicken. Then you lower the flame and let it cook away for an hour and a half.â Thereâs more muffled shouting on her end of the phone. âHe wants you to know that you have to taste it as youâre going along to see if you have enough salt and pepper,â she adds. âHe wonât shut up.â As for the matzo balls â mutzie balls, as she says â she recommends doing it the easy way, with Manischewitz Matzo Ball Mix. I ask where she learned this recipe, and she balks, âWell, itâs not a real recipe. My mother made it that way. Everyone makes it that way.â I make the soup a few days later, on what happens to be Election Day. I chop vegetables, unwrap the chicken, and put everything in a pot with water, salt, and pepper. Iâm delighted to find that the recipe is truly impossible to mess up, which had been a concern for me because I rarely ever cook. True, I do own a pot in which I could theoretically make all sorts of soups and stews and pastas, but the only thing Iâve ever used it for is catching water that drips from my leaky air conditioner in the summer. Saul comes over while the soup is cooking. He turns on the election results and we watch them together with breaks for me to make matzo balls and check on the boiling pot of soup. I post photos of my progress in the kitchen on Instagram stories. âAlmost forgot to add parsley!â I cheerily caption one photo of the soup pot sprinkled with green leaves. I think everything is going swimmingly. Then I get a DM. âThatâs kale,â one of my Instagram followers points out. Oops. I guess you shouldnât expect a millennial to make a chicken soup with anything else. When dinner is finally ready, I carefully ladle two bowls of soup and add in matzo balls. The broth is fragrant with the scent of home. It's golden with a filmy texture, just as I remember it. I get a little verklempt â thatâs Yiddish for overcome with emotion. Just as much as (or even more so than) my Bat Mitzvah, successfully making a delicious chicken soup feels like the marker of becoming an adult Jewish woman. I savor every sip. If I want to see my favorite traditions passed along in the future, I have to make them a priority. Especially in the wake of the the mass shooting at the Tree Of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the rise of anti-Semitic hate crimes, embracing my Jewish-American heritage feels more important than ever. For some people, that means praying in synagogue or observing Shabbat. But for me, all I really want is a savory bowl of homemade chicken soup.

California State University, Northridge, President Dianne F. Harrison released a statement Tuesday, the day before exams began, saying students who don't feel comfortable coming to campus can request ""alternative exam format options"" from professors. The decision was made after the the university police were notified of two different messages threatening a mass shooting on Wednesday at the campus, the school said in a release. Campus police said there is no indication the threats were credible, the release said. But the school decided as a precaution to allow exams to be offered remotely. Finals at the school began Wednesday and end Dec. 18. ""I recognize the extreme stress and anxiety the recent threats of violence have caused our community,"" the president said in a message posted on the school's website. ""Students should contact their instructors to request alternative arrangements. Any student requesting such an accommodation will not be subject to any instructor-imposed penalty."" University spokeswoman Carmen Ramos Chandler told NBC News that the method for administering off-campus exams will vary depending, for example, on whether professors are giving students written papers or a test for the final. Chandler also pointed out that the university offers online classes so already has some online exams. The first threat the school received was scrawled in a restroom in a university building on Dec. 5. It read: ""Mass shooting in Sierra Hall 12/12/18,"" with an drawing of a swastika, NBC Los Angeles reported. The second threat came on Monday night. A student at the school found a note on the floor of a classroom saying that a student at the nearby Northridge Academy High School would be carrying out a shooting at the university on Dec. 12.

175,https://www.bustle.com/p/17-articles-about-gun-violence-in-america-that-put-the-epidemic-into-perspective-15519301,"News  On Dec 14., the nation will recognize the sixth anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. This tragic anniversary might leave people looking for more information to explain such a uniquely American issue, one that only seems to have grown in volume and severity each year. For those who are interested, there are countless articles to read about gun violence in America that will put the epidemic into perspective. An interactive feature by Vox illustrates just how many mass shootings have taken place since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. It reports that there have been at least 1,917 mass shootings since then, with over 2,175 killed and over 8,000 injured. Vox further notes that since 2013, there has only been one full calendar week without a mass shooting (the week of Jan. 5, 2014). Before a cultural issue can be solved, it must first be understood. The more people who actually understand what gun violence in America looks like, the more likely it will be that the American people elect politicians who are focused on combating the problem head-on, in the hopes that a tragedy like Sandy Hook will never happen again. Here are 17 articles to read about gun violence that will help you understand the problem from every angle: This article by The New York Times shows just how much easier it is to legally purchase a gun in the United States compared to other countries. For example, in Japan you have to go through 12 steps before purchasing a gun, including applying for a gunpowder permit and giving an interview with police about why you need a gun. Comparatively in the United States, you have to take a background check, and then you can purchase a gun. According to The Washington Post, there were over 12,000 gun-related deaths in 2018, and 68 deaths as the result of a mass shooting; mass shootings, in this instance, are defined as any incident in which four or more people were killed by a lone shooter or two shooters. And according to that same article, at least 175 of the weapons obtained by mass shooters were purchased legally (many of the shooters had multiple weapons). Fortune details the process that Australia went through to diminish gun violence in the country, in the wake of a mass shooting that left 35 dead and 18 injured. Within weeks of the event, Australia passed a bill that banned semiautomatic weapons. What's more, lawmakers introduced a gun buyback program that incentivized owners to sell their guns back to the government. Parkland shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez wrote an op-ed for Teen Vogue arguing why the United States needs better gun control laws. Gonzalez wrote, ""Young people in this country have experienced gun violence for their entire lives, only to be faced with a number of representatives and officials who have been seduced by the gun lobby or have generally failed to make effective change."" A Sandy Hook parent who was also a library clerk at the school wrote for Vogue about the lasting impact of the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. She wrote, ""Every dayâevery single dayâI think of those who died, those who were left behind to deal with their grief, and the person I used to be. Some days, the images slide by like a movie in my mind."" This detailed timeline by The Washington Post follows the history of gun control legislation in the United States, from the first federal gun control law in 1934 onward. The timeline shows how startlingly few laws have been passed from 1934 to 2013, at the time of the article's publication. The Second Amendment wasn't always as central to American politics as it is now. Vox breaks down how the NRA brought the Second Amendment to the forefront of the conversation in the nation, starting in the 1970s. FiveThirtyEight claims that, in a way, mass shootings have warped Americans' understanding of gun violence. Specifically, the article argues that mass shootings are not a comprehensive enough proxy for the diversity of gun violence, which also includes everything from suicides (the highest gun-related cause of death) to homicides. School shootings were the worst they've ever been in 2018, Vox reports. The article sites a database that confirms 2018 was the worst year on record for school shootings, with 94 gun violence incidents recorded at schools for the year, which isn't even over yet. This BBC article breaks down the gun violence epidemic across a range of variables, from which countries own the most guns, to the list of the worst mass shootings since 1991. One such chart reveals that public opinion is the most divided over the ""concealed carry"" policy. According to the Yale School of Public Health, gun violence is a public health issue, and should be treated as such. This article explains how critical the role of public health officials is currently and will be in the future as the nation works toward better gun control. For U.S. News & World Report, a survivor of the Borderline Bar and Grill shooting shared how the incident has shaped both her life and the life of her family. She said, ""Everything about a public space now gets me so scared. Going to school, I'm constantly watching my back. It really has, for now, destroyed my life. I don't feel safe going anywhere, nor do I want to go anywhere."" This exhaustive breakdown by RealClearPolitics explains how gun violence may be reaching new levels, but clarifies that it would be wrong to say it's a ""new"" problem for the United States. It also points out that gun violence in America, though unique for comparable developed countries, is by no means an issue entirely exclusive to the United States. The Washington Post explained how many clear ""warning signs"" there are for victims of domestic violence leading up to their deaths. For example, the article notes that in Fort Worth, Las Vegas, Oklahoma City, San Diego, and St. Louis, 36 percent of the men implicated in a domestic violence killing had had a restraining order against them at one point. Terri Roberts' son, Charlie Roberts, walked into an Amish school in 2006 and fatally shot five young girls. To The Guardian, she said, ""I was â always will be â his mother. Surely if anyone could spot signs of trouble it would be the woman who gave birth to him. At what point did bitterness begin to seethe beneath the surface contentment? Or hate tug harder at the mind and heart than love?â ... They're men. According to The New York Times, the only thing that almost all mass shooters in the United States have had in common is that they were men. What's more, they are, more often than not, white. The article lists many other smaller similarities that the shooters tend to share, as well. In a powerful essay for The Atlantic, a Florida radiologist detailed her experience working with victims of the Parkland school shooting. She wrote, ""A typical AR-15 bullet leaves the barrel traveling almost three times faster thanâand imparting more than three times the energy ofâa typical 9mm bullet from a handgun."" On Friday, dozens of vigils will take place across the country to honor the children and adults who lost their lives in the Sandy Hook shooting. You can find out about vigils taking place near you through the Newtown Foundation. If you want to take additional steps toward legislative action to prevent future gun violence, you can support movements like Everytown for Gun Safety and March for Our Lives. You can also find out who your congressional representative is and call them to let them know how you feel about the current state of gun violence in the country. YouLobby has sample scripts you can look over that detail the various laws that could be put into place to prevent future violence. Furthermore, you can tell your congressional representative that you will not support their future candidacy if they're being funded by the NRA.

176,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/briefing/brexit-michael-cohen-china.html,"Advertisement Supported by Let us help you start your day. By Penn Bullock  Good morning. Theresa May lives to govern another day, Michael Cohen gets prison time and China holds its fire on trade. Here’s the latest: The British prime minister survived the greatest threat yet to her leadership, winning a confidence motion called by lawmakers in her own Conservative Party. But it was something of a hollow victory. Mrs. May had to promise her party that she would not stand for re-election, and while she got the support of 200 Conservative lawmakers, 117 voted against her. That sizable opposition could still imperil the parliamentary prospects of her Brexit proposal, experts said. Impact: Under Conservative Party rules, Mrs. May can’t be challenged again for a year, which will give her some time and solid ground. Outlook: Mrs. May’s Brexit plan will probably fail to pass. Our interactive explores what happens then. The punishment for President Trump’s former lawyer was partly for his role in a hush-money scandal that could threaten Mr. Trump’s presidency. Mr. Cohen said in court that Mr. Trump directed him before the 2016 election to arrange payments to a pornographic film actress and a former Playboy model, who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Here are some key takeaways from the sentencing. Another angle: Prosecutors announced that the tabloid publisher American Media Inc., which played an important role in the scheme, was cooperating. Quote of note: “I blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today,” Mr. Cohen told the court, “and it was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light.” Go deeper: Rudy Giuliani is serving as Mr. Trump’s lead personal lawyer while also soliciting business overseas, raising ethics questions. “I’m probably the most ethical person you ever met,” he told us. The Hungarian Parliament, controlled by Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s far-right party, approved the creation of a parallel court system that will go into operation within a year. What it means: The old court system will function with a shrunken purview. The new system, known as the administrative courts, will handle politically sensitive matters like election law, corruption and the right to protest. Mr. Orban’s justice minister will hire the judges. Analysis: The government says the plan is well within European and international standards. Critics say it takes a wrecking ball to judicial independence, which was already weak in Hungary. Reaction: Some lawmakers delayed the vote by blowing whistles for more than two hours, and about 2,000 protesters marched through Budapest. But anger was more focused on another piece of legislation, denounced as “the slave law,” which allows companies to force employees to work the equivalent of roughly one extra day per week. The Chinese government has tempered its approach to U.S. trade negotiations even after Canada, prompted by the U.S., arrested a top executive at the Chinese tech giant Huawei. China has set aside the issue of the arrest, while following through on trade concessions to the U.S. — and it may have no choice. With its economy in a sharp downturn and the trade war worsening its position, China is negotiating from weakness and aiming for lasting calm. Looking ahead: If the executive is extradited to the U.S., President Xi Jinping of China could feel pressure to escalate. President Trump raised the possibility of intervening in the case if doing so helped achieve “the largest trade deal ever made.” Experts told us his intercession would be legal but would set a dangerous precedent for executive power. For you: Mr. Trump’s focus on trade and tariffs has been decades in the making, transforming him from a businessman into “Tariff Man.” A superhero comic tells the tale. Manhunt in France: Officials said the deadly shooting at a Strasbourg Christmas market that killed two people was an act of terrorism, and hundreds of police officers hunted the fugitive assailant, a man described as a career criminal and Islamic extremist. How the mighty fall: A Chinese oil tycoon, Ye Jianming, established high-profile connections in Washington — up to the family of former Vice President Joseph Biden — and brokered business deals in far-flung places like North Korea. Now Mr. Ye is in Chinese custody and his empire is crashing down. World peace on the run: U.N. diplomats from around the globe go on weekly pre-dawn jogs through Central Park in New York, putting aside their hierarchical titles and policy disagreements and focusing instead on shared concerns, from aching joints to parenting. Catholic shake-up: The Vatican removed two cardinals implicated in sexual abuse cases from a powerful council, including George Pell of Australia, who has been facing charges of sexual abuse in secretive Australian legal proceedings. Parkland findings: A Florida state commission investigating the mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida, found that sheriff’s deputies — more than a half-dozen — who raced to the school and heard gunshots remained outside the building. Backtracking: Days after Britain said it would suspend its so-called “golden visas,” which give wealthy investors a fast track to residency, the government said the program remained in force without providing an explanation. U.S. deportation policy: Dozens of Cambodian immigrants in the U.S., many of whom fled the Khmer Rouge, are expected to be deported over the next few days, according to human rights organizations and an American official. A familiar face: Germany released an old Stasi ID card that belonged to a young Vladimir Putin when he was a Soviet intelligence agent in East Germany. Willy Wonka’s nightmare: Liquid chocolate escaped from a German factory, caking a street and requiring firefighters to dig up the “sweet danger with shovels and muscle power,” officials said. Tips for a more fulfilling life. Recipe of the day: Harness the savory-sweet flavors of Korean barbecue with this recipe for meatballs. It’s healthy to get enough sleep, but not too much sleep. Here’s what we know about diet and weight loss. Maybe the world is not so small after all — even in an age of mass culture. In Spain, drumming parties called tamboradas go around the clock for days. Across Georgia, athletes perform chidaoba — wrestling accompanied by music. And in Kazakhstan, horse farmers celebrate the new breeding season with songs, dances and games. The cultural agency of the U.N. recently added these traditions, and more, to its List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The idea is to recognize and preserve unique and impalpable rituals that are passed down through generations. Unesco acknowledges music and dance, hunting practices and traditional crafts, knowledge about nature and the universe — in short, the things that tell us who we are. Traditions in danger of vanishing are given a special designation. This year those included traditional Egyptian hand puppetry and Syrian shadow play. You can browse hundreds of examples, many with videos, at Unesco’s website. Jean Rutter wrote today’s Back Story. Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.

Data shows US gun deaths at highest level in 20 years ... FBI kept files on peaceful climate change protesters Last modified on Thu 13 Dec 2018 12.44 GMT Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories.  The embattled British prime minister, Theresa May, flew to Brussels on Thursday to continue Brexit talks with the EU after surviving a vote of no confidence from MPs in her own party. May won the poll of Conservative lawmakers by 83 votes, but her leadership was left damaged by the loss of support from more than a third of her MPs. She has signalled she will step down before the next election but, in the meantime, it remains unclear what effect the government infighting will have on her Brexit strategy. Crisis of confidence. In our Today in Focus podcast, Anushka Asthana hears from MPs and from political correspondent Jessica Elgot about just how damaging a day of public infighting has been for May and her party. Donald Trump’s former fixer Michael Cohen broke down in tears in a New York courtroom on Wednesday, as he was sentenced to three years in prison for what the judge described as a “veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct”. Cohen said it was his “blind loyalty” to the president that had led to his committing the crimes in question, including lying to Congress and facilitating illegal hush payments to two women alleging affairs with Trump. National Enquirer. In a further legal setback for the president, American Media Inc, the publisher of National Enquirer, has told prosecutors it worked “in concert” with Trump’s presidential campaign to pay a Playboy model $150,000 in hush money, prosecutors announced. Legal costs. Perhaps the only real winners on the sprawling legal battlefield created by the various Trump-related inquiries are the lawyers. Peter Stone looks at the legal costs so far, and sees which Republican donors have been paying the bills. Almost 40,000 people were killed in shootings in the US in 2017, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting gun deaths at the highest rate since 1996. The deadliest mass shooting by an individual in US history occurred last year, when 58 people were killed by a gunman at a music festival in Las Vegas. But the disturbing figures were boosted more by the steady rise in suicides, which accounted for around 60% of total gun deaths. Global statistics. Just six countries are responsible for more than half of all gun deaths worldwide: Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, and the US. Three sixtysomething environmental activists from Iowa were included in a federal surveillance report after taking part in a peaceful protest at a BP oil refinery in 2016.

Yet the police decided these weren’t hate crimes. By
      
        Peter Aldhous Posted on December 13, 2018, at 12:09 p.m. ET Mark Casarez outside of his apartment in Bedford, Texas. The dispute ended in a severe beating on the street in Irving, Texas, after five teens surrounded 16-year-old Mark Casarez, hurling anti-gay abuse. But the seeds were sown in the school hallway, when Casarez saw his friend Jennifer being harassed by a younger boy. “She was telling him to stop and he still had his hands on her,” Casarez told BuzzFeed News. Casarez pushed the boy, who fell to the floor and then ran to fetch his cousins. “They called me a faggot, called me a queer,” said Casarez, who was open about his sexuality. A couple of days later, Casarez said, he got off the bus on the way home from school, near the apartment complex where he lived with his mother. So, too, did four of the boys who had abused him earlier. Waiting for them was an 18-year-old high school dropout described in the police incident report as a suspected gang member. “You need to hit this faggot,” one of the group said to the boy Casarez had pushed at school. They surrounded, jostled, and taunted him. “‘Faggot, queer, gay.’ They just kept going on,” Casarez said. The first blow caught him on the side of his head, leaving his ear ringing. By the time the group scattered, disturbed by a witness who had pulled up in her car, Casarez had a fractured eye socket and two broken teeth. He couldn’t open his mouth properly, and his vision was blurred. “I was pretty much freaking out,” he said. Casarez needed facial reconstructive surgery, and would later experience panic attacks. The oldest of his attackers was sentenced to seven years’ probation for aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury. Yet despite noting the anti-gay abuse surrounding the incident, neither the police officers on the scene nor the detective who investigated the case logged it as a hate crime — that is, an offense motivated by prejudice against a person’s race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, gender, gender identity, or disability. When asked about the incident, the Irving Police Department agreed it should have been reported in the national hate crime statistics compiled by the FBI. It was “an oversight on our part,” Irving Police Department spokesperson James McLellan told BuzzFeed News by email. This blindness to hate crimes is not an isolated occurrence. Year after year, the vast majority of police departments across the country report zero hate crimes to the FBI. After sifting through more than 2,400 police incident reports from 2016 obtained from 10 of the largest such departments, BuzzFeed News identified 15 assaults in which the cops’ own narratives suggested that the suspect may have been motivated by bias. Each should at least have been flagged as a possible hate crime and subjected to further scrutiny, according to three independent experts who reviewed the documents. “If it is a suspected hate crime, that should be tagged and referred up the chain of command,” said Brian Levin, a former New York City cop who heads the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. “What is so striking is that problems that we thought were eliminated are still going on in large jurisdictions.” Flowers for shooting victims at a memorial outside the Emanuel AME Church on June 18, 2015, in Charleston, South Carolina. Everyone who has studied the issue knows that the FBI’s statistics represent just a fraction of the total hate crimes committed across the US. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, an estimated 250,000 people a year say they are victims. Yet when the FBI unveiled its 2017 national statistics last month, it reported just 7,175 hate crimes, up from 6,121 in 2016. That’s partly because fewer than half of victims report hate crimes to the police. And even when they do, the information frequently doesn’t get passed to the FBI. The agency was charged with gathering data on hate crimes by Congress in 1990, but these submissions are voluntary: The FBI can’t compel city police departments, county sheriffs, or other local law enforcement agencies to send in their numbers. Almost 1 in 5 local agencies don’t participate in the FBI’s data collection program. Of those that do, nearly 90% tell the feds that no hate crimes happened on their watch. But that doesn’t always square with their own records. ProPublica, which leads the Documenting Hate project in which BuzzFeed News is a partner, last year reported on clear discrepancies between local statistics of incidents officially marked as “hate crimes,” obtained through its public records requests, and the numbers that ended up in the FBI’s hands. We wanted to know whether police are failing to properly document hate crimes — and in particular, offenses involving violence — in the first place. To find out, we submitted public records requests to 30 police departments in the largest cities that reported zero hate crimes over the five years from 2012 to 2016 — then the most recent year in the FBI’s statistics. We asked them to provide their 2016 incident reports for crimes of aggravated assault, which involve an attempt to inflict injury or a threat of violence with a deadly weapon. (In the latest 2017 FBI hate crimes data, 788 of the 7,175 recorded hate crime incidents involved an aggravated assault.) Ten police departments responded with reports containing narratives describing each incident. In six departments — including three in the Miami metropolitan area and two in the Dallas-Fort Worth area — we identified assaults that arguably should have been recorded as hate crimes. In part, what we were able to uncover reflects the relatively strong public records laws in Florida and Texas. Other cities, across a dozen more states, denied our requests, failed to respond, provided reports lacking descriptive narratives, or demanded prohibitively high fees to search their records. (Huntsville, Alabama, wanted more than $16,000, complaining that our request would “constitute an excessive burden on personnel.”) But Florida and Texas also do seem to report suspiciously few hate crimes for such large and diverse states. In the FBI’s 2017 statistics, released last month, participating agencies in Texas reported just 0.68 hate crimes per 100,000 residents, and those in Florida reported 0.71 — much lower than the 2.77 per 100,000 residents in California, 2.8 in New York, and 2.34 across the US as a whole. A tribute photograph at the Tree of Life synagogue during the midterm elections in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the aftermath of the shootings there. The incidents we uncovered provide a flavor of the violent offenses that are missing from the FBI’s national picture of hate crime. As incidents including the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October have shown, hate can exact a devastating toll in the US. But atrocities like this, and the June 2015 massacre of black worshippers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, don’t occur in a vacuum — they happen against a backdrop of everyday hatred and violence that some police departments are failing to recognize. Without documenting these offenses, it’s impossible to develop strategies to turn back the tide of hate, our experts said. “You can’t think about support services, you can’t think about prevention,” Phyllis Gerstenfeld, a hate crimes researcher at California State University, Stanislaus, told BuzzFeed News. “If we had better data, we’d have a better idea of who the victims are.” From Miami, the largest city in the US that reported zero hate crimes between 2012 and 2016, we obtained nearly 1,200 incident reports. They had only cursory descriptions, often condensing an incident into a single paragraph. Yet even these brief accounts suggested that the suspects in six of Miami’s aggravated assault reports from 2016 were motivated by bias against their victims. In one, a 67-year-old Latino man was racially abused by a homeless man (whom the police described as “oriental”) while eating outside a downtown pizza restaurant. “Go back to your country,” the assailant said, then punched the victim in the head. In another incident, the perpetrator turned up at a residence in the city’s Little Haiti neighborhood and shouted, “What the fuck are these Spanish people doing here?” He stabbed one of two men in the arm with a fork and pursued them, shouting, “I am going to kill you bitches.” Another incident was phoned in by the sister of a man who was taunted at a gas station about his sexual orientation by an acquaintance and then threatened with a gun. The police report described the victim as being in a “state of fear,” unable to keep still and worried about retaliation because the cops had been called. Miami Police Department. The Miami Police Department did not respond to our queries about these reports. But when BuzzFeed News pressed other departments on why the incidents we flagged weren’t logged as hate crimes, it became clear that the FBI’s guidelines on how to make that decision are open to interpretation — and that police may take a narrow view. To qualify as a hate crime, the FBI says an offense must be motivated “in whole or in part” by the offender’s bias. Some police officers, it seems, lean more toward the “whole” than the “part.” “Around the country, in my experience, if it’s not primarily motivated by bias, they miss it,” James Nolan, a sociologist at West Virginia University in Morgantown and formerly the FBI unit chief who oversaw the agency’s hate crime data collection program, told BuzzFeed News. Some police departments also seem to conflate gathering data on hate crimes with their prosecution. District attorneys are often reluctant to charge offenses as hate crimes, because that means proving the offenders’ motivation in court, which is notoriously difficult. But our experts said that this should not stop incidents from being included in departments’ hate crime statistics, and passed along to the FBI. Both of these problems were on display in the response from police in Syracuse, New York, after we asked about three incidents. In one, a nightclub bartender was told, “I’ll stab you, nigger,” by a man who was asked to leave the premises. In another, a grocery clerk was similarly threatened with a knife when he refused to give a customer free coffee. “You are Arabic and you kill people, I am going to kill you,” the victim was told. “For all of the incidents you mentioned, there did not appear to be enough information to prosecute as a hate crime,” Syracuse Police Department spokesperson Richard Helterline told BuzzFeed News by email. “Though the language is clearly inappropriate, there does not appear to be probable cause to say that the victims were solely targeted due to being a protected class.” The area in front of Cielo Azul Apartments in Irving, Texas, where Mark Casarez was attacked in November 2016. After Casarez was attacked, he said, the Irving Police didn’t seem very interested in the bias shown by his assailants. When he was interviewed in November 2016, a couple of weeks after the beating, the detective seemed focused on the fact that the incident was triggered by the altercation at school, rather than the abuse that accompanied the beating. “He kind of said, ‘Just because they’re calling you names doesn’t make it a hate crime.’” Although it’s true that the FBI says the “mere utterance” of abusive terms isn’t enough to demonstrate that an incident was a hate crime, the agency provides a series of other guidelines to help make the decision — including whether the victim and the perpetrator were from different groups related to the alleged bias, whether the incident would have happened if they were from the same group, and whether a substantial proportion of the community where the incident occurred perceived it to be motivated by bias. Given the circumstances of the assault on Casarez, the experts we asked to review the incident reports concluded that there was a strong case to consider it a hate crime. We identified two further possible hate crimes in Mesquite, a suburb on the other side of Dallas. In its responses to our queries about these assaults, the Mesquite Police Department argued that other factors meant they were right to disregard the offenders’ bias. In one of the Mesquite incidents, Juan Meza, who runs a car wash, told a man with a shopping cart filled with bicycle parts to stop loitering on the premises. The police report mentions “racial slurs.” Meza told BuzzFeed News that the man said to him: “I won’t take any orders from a wetback.” Meza went to his truck to phone the police, and the man smashed his fist on the driver-side window. When Meza got out of the vehicle, the man came at him with a knife, continuing even after Meza pepper-sprayed him in the face. The other Mesquite incident happened at a medical facility, after two men, one black and the other Latino, intervened to defend a woman who was having an argument with her husband. The woman’s husband then left, before driving back in his truck, throwing a keychain at his wife’s feet, and confronting the two men, who had followed him outside. He pulled a gun on them, and according to the police report said: “What are you looking at, nigger? I got something for the Mexican, too.” Our experts said that these should have been flagged as possible hate crimes and sent to a supervisor for review. But Joseph Thompson, a spokesperson for the Mesquite Police, said, “The suspect did use some racial slurs in each one of them, but it was insufficient to be able to prove that the offenses were motivated by racial bias.” Meza didn’t see it that way. “I think it had to do with me being Hispanic and I was able to tell him to leave,” he said. Still, when BuzzFeed News approached the Mesquite Police Department again, shortly before this article went to press, a representative admitted that it may have made mistakes in hate crime reporting in the past. “We always strive to be as open and transparent as possible in our reporting of offenses,” department spokesperson Stephen Biggs told BuzzFeed News by email, “but we would readily admit there are probably a few offenses that could have have been classified differently over the years.” Juan Meza stands in the area behind National Pride Car Wash where a loiterer attempted to attack him with a knife in Mesquite, Texas. Other responses suggested that police have different standards for counting incidents to report to the FBI as assaults, as part of the wider Uniform Crime Reporting program, and counting hate crimes. Christian Lata, a spokesperson for the Hollywood Police Department, just north of Miami, questioned whether the assault we flagged in its jurisdiction was even a crime because charges weren’t pressed. “The victim is not necessarily a legal victim,” he said. This incident happened at a McDonald’s, where Aysar Fuqaha was speaking in Arabic with a friend. A group of young men started to mock his accent, Fuqaha told BuzzFeed News, and some fries were thrown, hitting him on the back of his neck. As the confrontation escalated, Fuqaha was hit over the head with a chair. “I was bleeding,” he said. “Still I have the mark.” By the time the police arrived, the assailants had fled, leaving a friend of theirs who, according to the restaurant manager, had tried to break up the fight. This witness disputed Fuqaha and a friend’s account of the incident, claiming that Fuqaha had started the fight. The police report described the witness as “very uncooperative” — he refused to provide any information about his associates. “This report did not meet the level of hate crime,” Hollywood Police spokesperson Lata said. “The reason why is there were conflicting stories. There was a witness on scene that said the victim was the one that instigated the fight.” This suggests a double standard, Nolan said, after reviewing the police report. The Hollywood Police logged the incident as an aggravated battery, identified Fuqaha as the victim, and counted it in the aggravated assault statistics it passed on to the FBI for 2016. “Why would you doubt the bias part of it?” Nolan asked. A report from the Miami Police Department showing an incident that should have been flagged as a possible hate crime. Most of the police departments we contacted stressed that they followed the FBI’s recommendations for “two-tier” hate crime reporting. This means that responding officers are supposed to flag incidents as a “suspected bias-motivated crime,” so that they can then be reviewed more thoroughly by a supervisor. But that only works if beat officers diligently flag any incident that might need further review. “We want to encourage a certain amount of false positives as opposed to the converse,” said Levin, the former cop now at California State University, San Bernardino. Most of the police departments did use incident report forms containing a section for officers to flag possible bias motivation. On Miami’s forms it appeared near the top, one of four possible boxes, alongside those for noting domestic violence, gang-related crimes, and incidents involving drugs. While the other boxes were sometimes changed from their default settings to reflect the nature of the crime, only eight out of nearly 1,200 Miami aggravated assault reports had any entry under bias motivation — which in these cases had been filled, apparently in error, with the words “civil disturbance.” The Miami Police Department said that, since 2016, it had taken steps to get officers to improve hate crime reporting. In March 2017, the department introduced a revised standard operating procedure, stating that the “complete and proper reporting of any incident involving a hate crime is mandatory.” And in June 2017, it adopted new electronic reporting system that forces officers to make an entry under “bias motivation.” Getting beat officers to pay more than lip service to recording hate crimes requires training in recognizing them and guidance in filling out incident reports correctly, our experts said. “It could be computer system prompts,” Nolan said. The Los Angeles Police Department, for instance, uses a two-page supplemental form to log details of possible hate crimes, including what group the bias was directed against and noting specific indicators that bias was involved. The LAPD form also contains multiple checkboxes to remind cops to record the victim’s perception of the incident, as well as the demeanor of the victim and suspect. Particularly important, Levin said, is a clear message from the top of a police department that responding to hate crimes, and supporting the victims, is a priority. In some police departments, that seems to be lacking. BuzzFeed News made repeated requests to the police in Hialeah, another city in the Miami metropolitan area, for comment on an incident in which a black man eating with his son at a Wendy’s restaurant was threatened by two homeless men, one of whom claimed to have a gun in his bag. “We don’t want niggers in Hialeah. I kill niggers like you,” the suspects yelled, according to the police report, which noted that witnesses corroborated the victim’s account. “That one seems pretty clear,” said Gerstenfeld of California State University, Stanislaus. “There doesn’t seem to be anything else that precipitated it.” Sergio Velazquez, Hialeah’s police chief, didn’t respond to our questions about the incident and his department’s policies. After his staff sent copies of the FBI’s guidelines and Florida’s hate crime statute, Velazquez finally sent a terse email: “There is nothing else we need to discuss.” The Irving Police Department on Dec. 8. Our experts stressed that judging whether an incident is a hate crime isn’t always straightforward, pointing to a second incident in Irving that definitely involved bias, but where the actual offense may not have been motivated by hate. It involved a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist prison gang, pulling a gun on a black man. (The FBI’s hate crime reporting guidelines tell police to pay attention to the involvement of known hate groups.) It happened in the parking lot of a convenience store, after the suspect allegedly said racial slurs to the black man, who was with his white wife. Surveillance video of the incident shows the black man reacting angrily to something that was said from a parked car, in which the white supremacist was sitting in the driver’s seat. The black man exited the passenger door of the SUV that his wife was starting to reverse out of their parking space, but then quickly retreated with his hands in the air when he saw the gun. That sequence of events could be enough to decide that the incident wasn’t a hate crime, said Nolan, the former FBI unit chief. Even though the suspect was a white supremacist, Nolan said, the crime of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon arguably was a response to the victim advancing toward the suspect’s car, rather than an expression of the suspect’s bias. (As BuzzFeed News continued to press the Irving Police Department about this incident, its spokesperson said by email: “After further discussion, that report may also be classified as a hate crime offense.”) Even in ambiguous cases like this, our experts said, incidents should be flagged as possible hate crimes and their existence shared with groups, such as local human relations commissions, that are trying to protect the civil rights of disadvantaged groups. “It’s important to understand that there was an armed white supremacist in that community,” Robin Toma, executive director of the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations, told BuzzFeed News. “It still has that negative impact on the victim,” said Joyce Sanchez, a hate crimes specialist with Orange County Human Relations in Santa Ana, California, adding that groups like hers want to know about all incidents involving hate, so they can offer support to the people affected. There are few signs that hate crimes reporting has improved since 2016. Of the six cities whose incident reports we queried, just one — Hollywood — reported any hate crimes in 2017, a single anti-gay incident involving vandalism or the destruction of property. Across the nation, there’s little room for complacency. Even in California, where police have a better record of recognizing hate crimes than their counterparts in Florida and Texas, a report from the state auditor released in May concluded that “law enforcement has not been doing enough to identify, report, and respond to these crimes.” A detailed review of three agencies — the LAPD, the Orange County Sheriff’s Department, and the San Francisco State University Police Department — found that each had failed to identify some hate crimes. And around one-third of state agencies in a wider survey had no method to encourage the public to report them. “You can’t address a problem if you don’t even know what the problem is,” Gerstenfeld said. ● Peter Aldhous is a science reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco.

        Alanna Bennett Posted on December 13, 2018, at 12:51 p.m. ET Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Atticus “Link” Lincoln (Chris Carmack) wait for the elevator on Grey's Anatomy. When Grey’s Anatomy premiered in March 2005, it quickly became known as the show with the sexy doctors. The characters, all undeniably beautiful, were ambitious surgeons who couldn’t stop making out in stairwells and silently lusting after one another in elevators. No on-call room was free from hookups. The New York Times called the show “Sex and the City Hospital.” A 2006 Grey’s-centric episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show heavily featured the show’s makeouts and flirtations, and Oprah herself was eager to know when the show’s primary couple — Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) — would finally have makeup sex after getting back together. But in 2018, which saw the end of Grey’s Anatomy’s 14th season and the beginning of its 15th, things have changed. Slowly, over the years, Grey’s Anatomy’s sex and covert yearning glances have taken a backseat to death, trauma, and long-term storylines about what it means to be a survivor. The show killed off Derek, its romantic leading man, in Season 11, and Meredith became a widowed mother of three. The series’ main characters have been through plane crashes, mass shootings, multiple disastrous storms, numerous brain tumors, fires, random beatings, C-sections without pain meds, and a whole lot more. Everyone is very, very tired — especially Meredith. As Grey’s has shown us over the past decade or so, tired people spend a lot less time embroiled in lurid affairs than those who are more wide-eyed, nimble, and unscarred. After years of relatively tempered libidos, however, the show finally found its way back to its roots in 2018. Grey’s Anatomy is horny again. Hallelujah. Meredith and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) make out in an elevator. Meredith Grey has always been a masterfully well-rounded character, never defined entirely by her love life or career but rather by how she deals with the medley of traumas, joys, and complications she’s faced on the show. She’s a neglected daughter, devoted friend, talented surgeon, and, at times, even a moving portrayal of suicidal ideation. Romance has been baked into Meredith’s storyline from the beginning, though, and the series has used sex and love as ways to crack Meredith open while titillating audiences at the same time. The entire series opened with a postcoital scene, after all. In the first moments of Grey’s, we find Derek lying naked on Meredith’s floor after what she assumes was a one-night stand. She later finds out he’s her boss, but she still kisses him in fits of passion and hooks up with him at parties. Their flirtation makes up a significant portion of the conflict in Season 1 — then they fall in love, and their back-and-forth over whether to actually commit to each other fuels conflict for at least four more seasons after that. During her off-periods with Derek, Meredith also sleeps with other men — strangers in bars, close friends, and veterinarians. There are references throughout the first four seasons to Meredith’s habit of “[screwing] boys like whores on tequila,” a pastime she shares with Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) and several other doctors on the show. It was a crass way of saying that Meredith — and by extension the show that bears her name — is unabashedly sexual in a way that is undeniable and, frankly, fun. Sex and flirtation have long provided Grey’s Anatomy with comic relief, emotion, and the chance to ogle its incredibly attractive cast. Romance — and the comedy and drama that come with it — is a big part of what made Grey’s Anatomy a success story in the first place. But Meredith, much like Grey’s itself, has always had a “dark and twisty” inner life. That darkness became even more prominent as the show went on, especially after a mass shooting in Season 6 and a plane crash in Season 8 left most of the main characters with a myriad of traumas to sift through. When Derek dies in Season 11, Meredith — already known for being emotionally hesitant to the point of dysfunction — retreats back into herself. While she’s close with people platonically and familially, Meredith resists all newcomers, and for a while romance couldn’t have been further from her mind. She’d had her big love already, she thought, so there was no point in going out to try to find another. “I’m closed for business,” she tells Maggie in Season 12. “Vagina City’s a ghost town. Orgasm train doesn’t roll through here anymore.” Grey’s has always had a way of following Meredith’s lead. The show was at its peak sexually when Meredith and Derek were doing their prolonged dance around each other, first when they were dating and sneaking around, and then after they were married. Those seasons boasted Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) and Cristina’s spiky romance, a brief sexual fling between Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), the raw sexual energy of Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and the bonkers chemistry and genuinely moving love story of Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), among many others. Every character on Grey’s was horny on main for about a decade, give or take. Then everyone just got really sad. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) make out in a shower. Grey’s kept up some of its horniness through Season 9, more or less, helped along by an influx of new characters and romantic storylines. Eventually, though, the traumas started to outnumber the flirtations. Repeated fatal accidents, infidelity, divorce, and dead babies are all pretty massive mood killers. To be clear, Grey’s has always maintained at least one romantic storyline at all times. People still have sex. But it hasn’t carried the same swagger as the show’s early years — and with such a big ensemble cast and so many dramatic narratives to juggle, it was only natural that the show’s priorities shifted. Meredith’s certainly did. And where Meredith goes, Grey’s follows. Introducing a new love story for Meredith soon after Derek’s death would have felt like a betrayal of the depth and importance of the couple’s decadelong love story. As a result, much of Season 12 of Grey’s is devoted to Meredith simply finding a way to keep going after such a big loss. Her life in Season 12 is still full of conflict and triumph — most of it just isn’t romantic. Pompeo and Grey’s executive producer Krista Vernoff wanted to lean into Meredith being a “medical superhero” after Derek’s death. Meredith is plenty busy without romance, and the show’s ratings saw a resurgence that season, possibly because viewers were eager to see how this legendary character would take on the next chapter of her life. Grey’s was laying the groundwork for the next era, though. Season 12 also saw the introduction of cardiac surgeon Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson), who was established by the end of the season as Meredith’s next love interest. Season 13 saw Meredith falling in love and having hot sex again. Fittingly, Meredith and Nathan bonded in large part over a shared sadness: They’d both lost the loves of their lives. But their love story wouldn’t last long — Nathan gets his fiancé (who had been thought to be dead) back at the end of Season 13. “[The writers] didn’t love the storyline, so that ended,” Pompeo wrote in the Hollywood Reporter by way of explanation. And while Nathan showed Meredith that she could connect with someone again, the two didn’t have the kind of spark that could be milked for seasons on end. Meredith winning the Harper Avery Award, surgery's biggest honor. With Nathan’s exit, both the show and Meredith were at an impasse. Meredith would remain a worthwhile and landmark character with or without a love interest — but did they really want to keep her single forever? To let Vagina City remain a ghost town, as Meredith had put it? Meredith doesn’t need a man; she’s plenty all by herself. But so much of Meredith’s character development in the early years of Grey’s was based around her emotional reticence when it came to opening herself up to love. She showed through her relationship with Derek that she could overcome that. She’s proven the same thing in the realms of family and friendship as she’s let two sisters into her life. For Meredith to remain a stoic widow, though, resigned to spend the rest of her life without feeling those big, exciting sparks again, would be a remarkably cynical choice on the part of the show’s writers. That choice would go against what Grey’s has always been — a melodrama that is morbid but never fatalistic and that always falls back to believing in the healing powers of love, romantic or otherwise. As Meredith said a decade ago, in therapy to overcome a hesitation around romance that she couldn’t quite understand: “So you think I’m broken? Fix me. ‘Cause I’m no quitter.” Nick Marsh (Scott Speedman) and Meredith together in ""One Day Like This."" At the beginning of 2018, during the second half of the show’s 14th season, the sparks came back to Grey’s in a big way. In “One Day Like This,” Meredith meets transplant surgeon Nick Marsh (Scott Speedman). Nick is having complications from his own liver transplant, and for the span of an episode he becomes Meredith’s patient. Speedman, who some may remember as the dashing, golden-haired main love interest Ben on Felicity, brought to Grey’s the full force of peak WB-era charm. Nick takes an instant interest in Meredith, and as the two banter, Meredith’s defensive emotional force field starts to crumble. She visibly warms; she smiles when he smiles. Meredith does something she rarely does: She confides in Nick and tells him about her life and dreams. He does the same back to her. At the end of the episode, Meredith sits in a bar with Alex, recounting her flirtation with Nick. “I really like the way my life is now,” she said. “I just… He made me feel something that I hadn’t felt since Derek.” There were obstacles, though: Nick is her patient, and he lives in Minnesota. Grey’s executive producer Krista Vernoff told TVLine, “We all loved him, but Nick was designed as a one-episode guest star,” not a long-term love interest. But as Alex asked Meredith, “Is it really the worst thing in the world, knowing that [romance] is out there if you want it?” The episode ends with Meredith sitting at the same bar where she met Derek. As she turns around, the show cuts to a shot of Meredith from the first season. She looks young and hopeful, and Meredith’s episode-ending voiceover makes clear where her mind is: “One single day can fill us with more possibilities than we can imagine.” “One Day Like This” was a bright spot in the season. The episode breathed life back into the show’s relationship to love, especially as it related to its main character. Even if Nick never returns to the show, his brief flirtation with Meredith was a reminder of what a rush romantic human connection can be — for viewers as much as for Meredith herself. The show then spent the remainder of 2018 slowly but deliberately backing up that point. The Season 14 finale of Grey’s takes place at Alex’s wedding to Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington), his on-and-off girlfriend since Season 9. After series regular April Kepner (Sarah Drew) almost dies in the incredibly dark penultimate episode, the finale allows the entire ensemble to gather together and celebrate love. This is hard on beautiful senior resident Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), whose girlfriend moved to Switzerland a few episodes ago. After getting drunk at the ceremony, DeLuca drunkenly kisses Meredith. Meredith evades his advances but tells him that she’s flattered. In the lead-up to the most recent season of the show, which started this fall, ABC’s promo for Season 15 felt like a true callback to the show’s early days. The trailer teased “an explosive love triangle” between Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), and Amelia; two exceptionally hot new doctors joining the cast — Chris Carmack’s Atticus “Link” Lincoln and Alex Landi’s Nico Kim; and new twists, one of which involved Meredith and DeLuca making out in bed together. The Season 15 premiere opens with that makeout scene, which turns out to be a sex dream Meredith is having. The opening establishes very quickly that Season 15 is determined to return to the show’s flirty, sexy roots. For the entire season so far, Meredith has been flustered by her own horniness, which is more complicated for her to act on now that she’s a widowed mother of three as opposed to a young, single intern. The season premiere also introduces a new patient, a matchmaker named Cece (Caroline Clay), who makes it her mission to get Meredith back out in the dating world. Cece convinces Meredith to go out on dates and to challenge herself by confronting the emotional issues that have kept her from pursuing romance in the past. Crushes have also made a big comeback in Season 15. Though in the premiere a hungover DeLuca is horrified to remember that he’d kissed his boss, he spends the ensuing episodes watching Meredith closely. Whenever the two are in the same room, his gaze is constantly locked on her, a small crooked smile on his face from his clear respect of her work and affection for who she is as a person. DeLuca isn’t Meredith’s only admirer: Link asks her out to drinks soon after joining the hospital staff. Though she rejects him at first, it’s clear she’s intrigued by the idea of him — and of DeLuca, too, whom she seems to gravitate to almost as much as he’s drawn to her. Meredith’s storylines throughout the first half of Season 15 have been underlined by flirtation in multiple directions. Thank god for her horniness — her casual love triangle with Link and DeLuca has brought a chemistry and levity to Meredith’s story that’s been missing since well before Derek died. In the midseason finale that aired Nov. 15, an emotional moment with Cece spurs Meredith to accept a date with Link. Seeing this, DeLuca knows he needs to act fast if he doesn’t want to miss his shot. When the two have a moment alone together, Meredith tells DeLuca how much he impresses her. “Well, you amaze me, Dr. Grey,” he says in return. “And while I’m feeling brave: I’m not sorry I kissed you at the wedding, because it’s all I’ve been able to think about ever since. And I know you have options. But I want you to know that I’m one of them.” Meredith and DeLuca talk about their feelings. His voice is confident but warm, and Meredith doesn’t back away like she often does when confronted with an emotional decision. She seems to resist a smile, rattling off a list of reasons they shouldn’t be together (she’s his boss; he used to date her sister). But she doesn’t reject him. She breathes in deeply and braces herself. She wants to say yes, but never in the entire run of Grey’s has Meredith been able to jump into a whirlwind romance without pushing it away first. That’s just who she is. So she tells him she has some thinking to do, and she leaves. That midseason finale was only the first part of a two-part episode, though, and it ends with a cliffhanger in which Meredith and DeLuca get trapped together in an elevator. The moment feels like yet another callback to the early years of Grey’s, when flirtations on elevators were so rampant and romantically charged that Oprah parodied the scenes. Derek proposed to Meredith on an elevator; before that, they spent plenty of time in them, tortured and yearning side by side. Elevators are Grey’s shorthand for romance, and here was Meredith locked in one with her newest and most promising love interest. Nico (Alex Landi) and Levi Schmitt (Jake Borelli) make out in an ambulance, because everyone is horny on Grey's again. Grey’s doesn’t seem interested in leaving the sadness behind for good. Morbidity has also been baked into the show from the get-go; sex and death have historically gone hand in hand for the series. Trauma is never too far from sight, either; these characters have been through too much for a life without scars to make any sense. Still, Grey’s proved in 2018 that it is interested in exploring an emotional renaissance. The show is at its best when it’s both funny and sad, emotionally grounded and grandly melodramatic. By resuscitating the romantic spark within Meredith, the show is in turn reviving itself. The second half of the midseason two-parter airs in January when the show returns from its winter hiatus. For a time, at least, Meredith will still be trapped with DeLuca, and she’ll have a decision to make. Grey’s would not have survived this long if watching Meredith Grey make these types of choices weren’t utterly captivating — and as the show’s 2018 efforts have reminded us, there just might be life in her yet.

Politico reported on Wednesday that Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, chairman of the commission investigating the shooting, recommended a “major expansion” of Florida’s Guardian Program, “which has allowed some non-educators to carry weapons in schools.” Currently, 25 of 67 school districts participate in the program. Earlier in 2018, the state passed the Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, which enabled school officials to arm non-educator staff trained as “guardians.” The law prohibits teachers from the training, but Gualtieri’s recommendation asks lawmakers to amend the rule to equip and train teachers with guns. “We need to put aside these ideological positions and realize what reality calls for,” he said, echoing the president’s previous calls for armed teachers. There isn’t a whole lot of research on the public health crisis created by guns because National Rifle Association-backed politicians have blocked research on guns for the past two decades by stifling research funds. What we do know, however, is that access to guns does not reduce the threat of violence, and in fact, likely increases the threat of violence. America’s high gun ownership is directly correlated to its high number of mass shootings.  A study published in the American Journal of Public Health in July also points out that “the anticipation of violence can lead to increased anxiety, fear, and depression,” meaning that simply the presence of guns and training for mass shootings “in all likelihood, would heighten levels of anxiety and negatively affect a school’s climate.” (The report also notes that arming teachers nationwide would take up an estimated 30 percent of the federal education budget, a system that is already drastically underfunded). Gun control, meanwhile, is proved to be an effective way to curb gun violence. Only one member on the panel opposed the idea: Max Schachter, whose son, Alex, died in the shooting. “I don’t think teachers should carry guns,” Schachter said. “I think they have enough on their plate.” I’m sure it’s been noted elsewhere, but mandatory arming of teachers is simply a multi-million dollar gift to the NRA and weapon manufacturers. This is yet another grift in an endless list of grifts.",2018-12-13 10:20:00,The Commission Investigating the Parkland Shooting Wants Florida Schools to Arm Teachers ,,6154,http://jezebel.com

David Becker/Getty Images The Route 91 Harvest festival is reportedly on the verge of returning to Las Vegas, albeit at a different site than where 58 people were murdered during a mass shooting on October 1st, 2017. The future of the festival, which wasn’t held in 2018, has been very much in limbo, as hundreds of the shooting’s survivors filed lawsuits, alleging negligence by Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and its owner MGM Resorts International and Live Nation, the organizer of the festival. However, on Wednesday, Julie Matway, Chief Operating Officer of Country Nation, which is led by Live Nation’s country-festival division, said during a music-industry conference that plans are underway to bring back the three-day festival.

We are working hard on that. Hopefully we will get it online for 2019.”  The response prompted applause from the crowd at Mandalay Bay, the same hotel where a gunman fired at the crowd of 22,000 from his 32nd floor hotel suite. Since the shooting, the Las Vegas Village, the site of the massacre on the south end of the Las Vegas Strip, has remained fenced off and empty. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported on Thursday that the new Route 91 festival would take place in the fall at the Las Vegas Resorts Festival Grounds, a 35-acre plot on the north end of the Strip.

The shooting took place on the final day of the 2017 festival while Jason Aldean performed. MGM has been tight-lipped about everything tied to Route 91. In a prepared statement, Debra DeShong, Senior Vice President of Global Corporate Communications and Industry Affairs for MGM Resorts International, told Rolling Stone in April, “Security remains a top priority at all MGM Resorts properties, facilities and entertainment venues, and our security team works tirelessly to protect the safety of our guests and employees.

House Democrats hold first committee hearing on Capitol riot News By Tamar Lapin Submit December 13, 2018 | 3:46pm				| Updated December 13, 2018 | 4:37pm French police on Thursday shot dead a man suspected of gunning down three people in France’s largest Christmas market — bringing an end to a three-day manhunt, according to local media. Cherif Chekatt, 29, was “neutralized” by cops in Strasbourg’s Neudorf district, near where more than 700 officers had been hunting for him earlier in the day, Le Parisien reported. Armed with a knife and firearm, Chekatt, a Strasbourg native, is believed to have unleashed an attack at the market in Place Kleber square Tuesday evening, leaving three people dead and 12 wounded. Chekatt was thought to have been injured in a shootout with soldiers but managed to escape and hadn’t been seen since a taxi dropped him off in Neudorf. Authorities released his picture Wednesday to help track Chekatt, who has a long rap sheet, including 27 conviction in four European countries. Chekatt had been flagged for Islamic extremism and was radicalized in jail, officials said. He was heard yelling “God is great!” in Arabic before allegedly opening fire. Earlier Thursday, a fifth person was detained for questioning by police in connection with the mass shooting. The suspect’s parents and two brothers have been in custody since Wednesday. The Strasbourg Christmas market will reopen on Friday, said Interior Minister Christophe Castaner. With Post wires Read Next Online bomb threats nationwide were part of bitcoin extort...

187,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/_51velWaaNg/,"French police on Thursday shot dead Cherif Chekatt, the suspect in this week’s Strasbourg shooting, which killed three people and wounded 13 near the city center’s popular Christmas market. France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the 29-year-old suspected gunman was killed in the Neudorf-Meinau quarter of Strasbourg following a “police operation,” which began at 9 p.m. local time. Earlier Thursday, Security forces, including the elite Raid squad, took action in Neudorf based on “supposition only” that Chekatt could have been hiding in a building nearby two days after the attack. As Breitbart News reported, Chekatt allegedly shouted “Allahu Akbar!” and sprayed gunfire from a security zone near the Christmas market Tuesday evening. Authorities said he was wounded during an exchange of fire with security forces and a taxi driver dropped him off in Neudorf after he escaped. Prosecutors opened a terror investigation, which included more than 700 officers searching for the suspect, who had a long criminal record and had been flagged for extremism, according to government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux. This week, five people were arrested and have remanded in custody in connection with the investigation, including Chekatt’s parents and two of his brothers. The Paris prosecutor’s office said the fifth, who was arrested Thursday at an undisclosed location, was a member of Chekatt’s “entourage” but not a family member. Police distributed a photo of Chekatt, with the warning: “Individual dangerous, above all do not intervene.” France has raised its three-stage threat index to the highest level since the attack and deployed 1,800 additional soldiers across the country to help patrol streets and secure crowded events. In the wake of the attack, Griveaux called on protesters who have become known as the “yellow vests” and who have been demonstrating across France since last month not to take to the streets again this weekend. French authorities said Chekatt, born in Strasbourg, appeared on a watch list of people flagged for extremist views. They said he had 27 criminal convictions, receiving the first at age 13. The people who died in the attack included a Thai tourist, 45-year-old Anupong Suebsamarn, according to the Thai Foreign Ministry. Five of the wounded were in serious condition, the prefecture of the Strasbourg region said. French President Emmanuel Macron was in Brussels on Thursday for a European Union summit.

          / CBS/AP Strasbourg, France — The man authorities say killed three people near a Christmas market in Strasbourg died Tuesday in a shootout with police at the end of two-day manhunt, French authorities said. Paris prosecutor's office, which handles terror cases in France, formally identified the man killed in the eastern French city as 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt, a Strasbourg-born man with a long history of convictions for various crimes, including robberies. Chekatt also had been on a watch list of potential extremists. The news came a couple of hours after Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said a man believed to be Chekatt had been gunned down during a police operation in the city's Neudorf neighborhood. Castaner said the suspect opened fire on police Thursday night when officials tried to arrest him. ""The moment they tried to arrest him, he turned around and opened fired. They replied,"" Castaner said. A local police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said the man who shot at police was armed with a pistol and a knife. Strasbourg mayor Roland Ries said police acted on a top from a woman. Local police officer Emmanuel Georg told BFM TV station that three police officers patrolling the neighborhood tried to intercept a suspect corresponding to Chekatt's description as he was about to enter a building. ""He opened fired, they responded and managed to shoot him down,"" Georg said. A witness to the shootout said he heard shots and rushed to the window to see what was happening. He closed the shutters when he spotted the cornered suspect across the street. ""I was very afraid for my children, I told them to go away, and I went to the side,"" Cem Akcakaya told The Associated Press. After it was over, he said he saw the man motionless on his back on the pavement, his left arm askew. Chekatt is accused of killing three people and wounding 13 on Tuesday night. Castaner said earlier Thursday that three of the injured had been released from hospital and three others were fighting for their lives. More than 700 officers were deployed to find Chekatt, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told CNews television. French authorities said Chekatt had 27 criminal convictions, receiving the first at age 13. The SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online, said the Islamic State group's Amaq news agency was claiming the gunman as a ""soldier"" of the group, although IS claims of responsibility have often been considered opportunistic in the past. Security forces, including the elite Raid squad, spent hours searching in the Neudorf neighborhood on Thursday based on ""supposition only"" that Chekatt could have been hiding in a building nearby two days after the attack, a French police official said. Chekatt grew up in Neudorf. Chekatt allegedly shouted ""God is great!"" in Arabic and sprayed gunfire from a security zone near the Christmas market Tuesday evening. Authorities said he was wounded during an exchange of fire with security forces and a taxi driver dropped him off in Neudorf after he escaped. So far, five people have been arrested and remanded in custody in connection with the investigation, including Chekatt's parents and two of his brothers. The Paris prosecutor's office said the fifth, who was arrested Thursday at an undisclosed location, was a member of Chekatt's ""entourage"" but not a family member. France has raised its three-stage threat index to the highest level since the attack and deployed 1,800 additional soldiers across the country to help patrol streets and secure crowded events. Residents of Strasbourg's Neudorf neighborhood expressed relief. ""Everybody's quite happy that the killer has been finally shot. I think now, the city and life can keep going on in Strasbourg,"" resident Pierre Plasse said. The people who died in the attack included a Thai tourist, 45-year-old Anupong Suebsamarn, according to the Thai Foreign Ministry. Five of the wounded were in serious condition, the prefecture of the Strasbourg region said. French President Emmanuel Macron was in Brussels on Thursday for a European Union summit. EU leaders held a minute of silence for the latest victims of a mass shooting in France. Hundreds of people gathered in Strasbourg's 500-year-old cathedral Thursday evening to mourn and seek comfort. ""Evil does not prevail,"" Archbishop Luc Ravel said.  ""And the message of Christmas has not been contradicted but rather confirmed by Tuesday's dramatic night: Evil and good are both there, but in the end the good will have last word."" Strasbourg's usually busy streets were eerily empty Thursday morning, with a heavy police and military presence. Some lit candles and brought flowers to a makeshift memorial at the site of the attack. ""You can feel a very heavy atmosphere due all these events,"" said resident Lucille Romance. ""People are in a state of shock and are avoiding getting out of their house."" First published on December 13, 2018 / 5:05 PM © 2018 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

195,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/obama-and-the-collapse-of-our-common-american-language,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Vinson Cunningham Before the speeches started in Dallas at yesterday’s memorial service for the five police officers killed last Thursday by a military-trained, ideologically confused sniper, a choir—interfaith, like the rest of the proceedings—sang “Total Praise,” by the popular gospel artist Richard Smallwood. Like many of Smallwood’s compositions, “Total Praise” mixes gospel and classical styles—Smallwood was raised in the black church and studied piano performance at Howard University—ending with a steadily crescendoing, fugally arranged chorus of amens. The soloist, Gaye Arbuckle, a woman with a halo of red hair, had begun with pretty precision, but, at the song’s end, over those final, booming amens, she belted out long, loud, vibrato-shaken notes that brought the audience, and the row of statesmen before her—Presidents and First Ladies Bush and Obama, Vice-President and Dr. Biden—to their feet in grateful applause. The scene—anchored as it was by the interplay of two musical languages, and culminating in a unanimous emotional response that couldn’t be explained fully by either—felt like a utopian metaphor for what, after four years of steadily worsening national communication about race and violence and the meaning of safety (beginning, let’s say, with the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin), this country seems urgently to need. The incredible danger of our polarization lies, I think, in a fact that has become unavoidably clear in recent months: the old common American language has all but evaporated, perhaps permanently. Consider the responses to the mass shooting at Pulse, a gay night club in Orlando, Florida, in June. Within hours, talk around the tragedy had descended into a bizarre Linnaean exercise: Was this homophobia or “radical Islamic terror,” an occasion to decry open borders or to rail, once again, against irresponsible gun laws? We seemed unable to dwell on the single incontrovertible item—the loss of life, the spilling of blood—because of our inability to categorize, or classify, its cause. Previous generations of Americans clashed even more drastically: slaveholders and abolitionists, segregationists and civil-rights marchers, unionists and employers. But these fights were bordered, rhetorically and intellectually, by the Protestant-Enlightenment language that has characterized the country since the beginning. The persuasive genius of Frederick Douglass, of Abraham Lincoln, of Ida B. Wells, of Cesar Chavez, sprang from a mastery of this language, and a perception of its application to a previously unimaginable future. Victory passed—had to pass—through exegesis. Today, thanks to the confluence of factors that, by now, are familiar—including, but not limited to, secularization; atomization; plain anguish born of rightful impatience—we speak no longer within one language (where understanding is hard, but possible) but across the gulf that seems, every day, to widen between many. We quibble over words, codes, signals, whistles. A speech, however clever, is increasingly unequal to the task. This scattering of the American Babel hung like a cloud over Obama’s speech at the service. As is his habit, he weaved artfully between one hand and the other—black and white, protesters and police—but the effort wasn’t nearly enough to achieve synthesis. He admitted as much in a line that flirted with despair: “I’ve seen how inadequate words can be in bringing about lasting change,” he said. Then, more to the point: “I’ve seen how inadequate my own words have been.” These sentences sounded like a subtle contradiction of Obama’s own argument, way back in 2008, in favor of the power of rhetoric, responding to Hillary Clinton’s charge that his campaign was built upon “just words.” They also explained the President’s almost pleading appeal—maybe a final one—for all of us to talk “honestly and openly, not just in the comfort of our own circles but with those who look different than us or bring a different perspective.” Obama also employed refrains on the subject of knowledge. “That’s the America I know,” he said repeatedly, echoing it with variations on the idea of a common understanding: “we know this,” “we know these things,” “police, you know it,” “protesters, you know it.” These lines seemed to appeal to something sublingual, something ultimately inexpressible—a concession, perhaps, that whatever ideas (and ideals) we still share reside elsewhere than in the tongue. Referencing the Old Testament book of Ezekiel, the President suggested a better body part as a starting place for unity: “I will give you a new heart, and put a new spirit in you,” he quoted, clearly hoping for America to accept a similar transplant. “I will remove from you your heart of stone, and give you a heart of flesh.” He added, “That’s what we must pray for, each of us: a new heart.” Another, more practical biblical injunction came from John’s Gospel: “Let us love, not with words or speech but with actions and in truth.” This brought another scripture to mind. When I was a kid I talked too much, and, whenever it was too much to bear, my mother would wearily quote from Paul’s first letter to the Thessalonians, begging me to “study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands.” (That final bit in reference, usually, to the dishes.) The next verse, which I learned much later, offers the result: “That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without.” That strange link, between quiet and empathy, could be a solution to the language problem that plagues us. Obama was right all those years ago: words do matter. And to achieve his longed-for softening of the American heart, we will eventually need new ideas, and a new language large enough to hold them. But it might serve us well to set aside our fetish for grand “conversations” while we think up the words to name our new troubles.

196,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/14/people-assume-im-a-rapper-can-country-music-get-over-racial-prejudice,"Black artists Jimmie Allen and Kane Brown are using their talent to change perceptions and earn mainstream recognition Last modified on Fri 14 Dec 2018 18.00 GMT In November, something unprecedented happened in the world of country music: two black artists reached No 1 spots in the same week. Jimmie Allen, a 32-year-old singer and songwriter from Delaware – an east coast state not normally associated with country – became the first black artist to chart a No 1 debut single for country radio airplay with his song Best Shot. And YouTube-covers-artist-turned-country-star Kane Brown hit the top spot on the Billboard album chart with his second album, Experiment. Allen first moved to Nashville in 2007 and spent the best part of a decade trying to get signed. “At first, things weren’t going my way,” he tells me. “I was something new – no one was going to take a chance on a black artist from Delaware – so I lived in my car for four months, working in a gym where I would wash my clothes and shower. I did any job you could think of, from waiter to janitor to personal trainer.” His persistence clearly paid off but Allen is emphatic about the effort it has taken. “I was one of those guys where nothing ever fell into my lap, I had to go out and work for it,” he says. “Especially since there is a lack of experience of people who look like me.”  Brown also spent several years on the sidelines. He auditioned for The X Factor but walked away because of attempts to put him into a boyband. He built a dedicated fanbase after posting videos of covers, and his September 2015 version of George Strait’s Check Yes or No went viral with more than 7m views. By October, a teaser for his own single Used to Love You Sober reached more than 11m views in two weeks. Country music still suffers from an image problem. It is stereotypically associated with cowboys, pick-up trucks and the vast expanses of America’s midwest, you might think it exists only to fulfil a yearning for a faded view of the US. This assumption is compounded by the fact that despite still being the most popular genre for radio play in the US – finding more listeners than news shows and pop stations – country artists are overwhelmingly white and male. Over the past decade, the only black artist of the genre to find mainstream success is Hootie and the Blowfish’s Darius Rucker, charting six No 1 hits since 2009; he is one of only three black artists to win a Grammy in a country category. Looking further back, there are only a handful of black artists who have crossed over: singer Charley Pride stands out with his 29 country No 1s from 1966 to 1987. Brown is conscious of how his mixed heritage has affected his career. “Some people automatically assume I’m a rapper,” he says, “but why wouldn’t I be country? It’s the music I’ve always listened to, and there are a lot of people that look like me who listen to and love country music too.” With his newfound fame, Brown is using his music to change perceptions, even targeting the NRA in American Bad Dream, a song about the Parkland high school shooting. “Now you got to take a test in a bulletproof vest / Scared to death that you might get shot,” he sings. This is all the more radical given country music’s ties to gun advocates, which was called into question after last year’s mass shooting at a country festival in Las Vegas. Brown’s approach has earned him fans of “all shapes, sizes, races and ages,” he says, making him the first artist to top all five Billboard country charts at once in 2017. Yet this year he was snubbed by the Country Music Awards, not receiving a single nomination, while at the cross-genre American Music Awards, he won all three of his categories. “In country music we are still behind the times,” Allen explains. “Outside of country music, it wouldn’t be new to anyone to be a black pop artist or a white rapper, but this genre is different.” The lack of black acts in country music is particularly marked since, Allen argues: “Country music came from black people – it all started with the blues and bluegrass.” The banjo – an instrument central to the genre – originated in West Africa, and early country stars such as Hank Williams were mentored by black musicians. Allen believes that black artists were edged out of country music in the second half of the 20th century because “by then, a lot of black people were involved in Motown, so they missed out. Their following generations would then similarly play in R&B and soul styles.” Such speculation does not account for the fact that major acts like Ray Charles released wildly successful country crossover albums at the time – and yet traditional country music remained largely white. Allen sees his and Brown’s music as continuing in country’s lineage, though, and at last they are receiving mainstream recognition. They will perform together on a nationwide headline tour in 2019. “Me and Kane are continuing in the tradition of country music because we’re not the first black artists to do it,” he says. “And it’s not just about black people saying they can do country, it’s about anyone in a career field that they’re chasing where they don’t see anyone like themselves.” Brown adds: “I want to be a role model, to show fans that no matter where you come from or what happens in your life, you can define who you are as a person. That isn’t specific to being any colour or background.” Ultimately, to be a country artist now “you don’t have to be a cowboy or have banjos on your song,” Allen says. Instead, his and Brown’s music, premised on modern production values and lyrics on the theme of self-acceptance and tolerance, could finally rid country of its stereotypes.",2018-12-14 06:00:41,'People assume I'm a rapper': can country music get over racial prejudice?,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

199,http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/12/14/states-passed-67-new-gun-control-laws-in-2018,"Lawmakers in 27 states passed 67 new laws aimed at  restricting gun access this year. This latest  analysis by the Giffords Law Center, a gun control organization founded by  former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, the Arizona Democrat who survived a shooting  in 2011, shows the unparalleled success the gun control movement has had this  year, in the wake of continued mass shootings. As Stateline reported in August, state lawmakers  — inspired by a movement led by the student survivors of the February mass  shooting in Parkland, Florida — enacted more than 50 new laws in the six months  following the incident. The laws, including some passed in  Republican-controlled states, ranged from banning bump stocks to allowing  authorities to temporarily disarm potentially violent people under “red flag”  laws. Lawmakers were inspired by the Parkland students, who took  to television, state legislatures and the streets to make their voices heard.  The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School left 17 high school  students and staff dead. Before this year, however, such success in passing gun  control legislation was not the trend in U.S. politics. In the years following  the Dec. 14, 2012, Newtown, Connecticut, massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary  School, most of the hundreds of state gun laws enacted expanded, rather than  restricted, access to firearms, according  to data compiled by Stateline earlier  this year. In those years, laws that sought to expand gun access included  those that allowed permitless carry, guns on college campuses and arming  teachers. Many of those sorts of proposals failed this year, though,  including proposals to allow residents to carry guns without permits in 10  states, the Giffords report found. In the five years since the Sandy Hook massacre, more state legislation backed by the NRA has been signed than legislation to restrict guns. The increase in gun-control laws marks a break from past responses to mass shootings. Daily update — original reporting on state policy, plus the day's five top reads from around the web.

@davidharsanyi David Harsanyi is a senior writer at National Review and the author of ""First Freedom: A Ride through America's Enduring History With the Gun, From the Revolution to Today."" This week, the allegedly unbiased fact-checkers at PolitiFact awarded their “Lie of the Year” award to the “online smear machine” that attempted “to take down” the survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. “The attacks against Parkland’s students stand out because of their sheer vitriol,” the piece explains. “Together, the lies against the Parkland students in the wake of unspeakable tragedy were the most significant falsehoods of 2018.” It should go without saying that those who spread the conspiracy theory that the activists in the wake of the horrific school shooting were “crisis actors”—kids only pretending to be victims—are exceptionally terrible people. It’s debatable, though, whether this conspiracy theory, which had no effect on policy or the students’ ability to march or speak out, should be considered the most significant political lie in 2018. I’m relatively positive that the vast majority of Americans have never heard it. It’s debatable, in fact, that it was even the most significant lie disseminated about the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High. After all, at a widely covered CNN anti-gun rally, the sheriff of Broward County misled the nation about the failures, cowardice, and incompetence that allowed the shooting to occur. And the sheriff of Broward County isn’t some random Twitter troll. The internet, particularly social media, has made conspiracy theories seem more pervasive and immediate. Conventional wisdom tells us that fake news is a serious and growing problem in American life. I’m skeptical that the trend is unique to our age. Whatever the case, it’s become a misleading tactic of some journalists to collect random tweets of crazy people or anonymous attention-seekers and use them as a digital straw man. This hyper-focus on fringe players is a way to create the impression that one side of the debate continues to stubbornly embrace “the truth” while the other is infested with slack-jawed yokels who’ll believe just about anything. PolitiFact is just employing a larger-scale version of this maneuver. Although I know of numerous Twitter accounts that have accused gun rights advocates of being terrorists—many of them featuring blue check marks—I can’t recall a single conservative in Congress, anyone in the National Rifle Association, or anyone in any other mainstream right-wing group accusing the Parkland kids of being crisis actors. I do recall an article on RedState questioning David Hogg’s actions the day of the mass shooting, but that was quickly corrected and apologized for. Yet PolitiFact spends much of its time detailing the Parkland kids’ cause by highlighting their political opponents who have nothing to do with the smear, implicitly linking them to the “Lie of the Year.” The piece is framed in a way that insinuates that anyone contesting the Parkland kids’ political cause is now in league with the online mob—and Russian bots! By the way, even if we allow that kids who have experienced this type of tragedy should dictate the contours of a policy debate, it is worth noting that there are “Parkland kids” who hold diverging opinions regarding the Second Amendment and arming teachers. They are largely ignored by the media. It’s not the kids’ fault that they find themselves the focus of ugliness on social media. It’s the fault of those who attack them and the fault of the adults who exploit them for political causes. Young people should be given some leeway in their activism, even if they say ridiculous things—and Hogg and other leaders of the March for Our Lives movement often say things that aren’t even in the proximity of the truth. There is no need for ad hominem attacks. But the “Parkland kids” were also given a massive stage on which to offer their uncontested emotionalism to drive the debate. Even though they’re kids, Americans have every right to challenge their contentions. The “online smear machine” is an amorphous and ugly entity that isn’t confined to any ideology and spares virtually no one in the public eye. But any way you look at it, imbuing it with an importance it doesn’t deserve isn’t doing public discourse any favors—even if it makes conservatives look bad.

God, we miss you,” Mowry-Housley, 40, wrote on Instagram Friday alongside a shot of Alaina, who died on Nov. 7 in the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, posing with her son Aden, 6. “Yesterday you were supposed to come home,” she continued, presumably referring to the date Alaina was scheduled to return home from college for winter break. “The questions of why consume my mind. But I must hold on to the fact that our Lord is sovereign. The reality of you not being here hits stronger today. I miss your giggles, I miss your smile, I miss the way you would roll your eyes when you heard someone say something crazy. I miss the way you would so gracefully scoop up Ariah and Aden, and the way you took their hands and walked away to play.” “You had a heart pure with love and kindness. Oh what this world needs more of now,” she continued. “My children loved you. I loved you. I know I have a guardian angel with me now. But selfishly I want you here with me. Until we meet and sing again.” RELATED: Tamera Mowry Honors Late Niece on Son’s 6th Birthday: ‘Alaina Was Excited to Come to Your Party’ Mowry went on to acknowledge the fact that her post coincided with the six-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, which killed 26 people, including 20 first-graders, in Newtown, Connecticut. “Ironically, 6 years ago today the senseless shooting of #sandyhookelementary occurred,” she wrote, going on to speak against gun violence.” “Praying for the families and individuals who have had to endure and survive senseless gun violence.

I don’t like to say move on, because I don’t think I’ll ever move on with the fact that she’s not here with me or with our family,” she told her co-hosts. “But she would want me to move forward and to use her voice as a catalyst for change, and that’s why I’m here today.” The mother of two then made a call for “change,” saying, “We need change when it comes to gun violence.” “And I don’t care if I have to knock on the doors of the White House to do it,” she shared, wiping away tears.

        Julia Reinstein Posted on December 14, 2018, at 4:20 p.m. ET A memorial for those killed in the Strasbourg attack. Four people were killed and 12 others injured when a gunman opened fire at a Christmas market in Strasbourg, France, on Tuesday, rankling a country already reeling from weeks of civil unrest. The 29-year-old shooter was killed by police two days later, following a massive manhunt. The French government labeled the shooting a terrorist incident — the worst this year in France and all of Europe. Here is what we know so far about those who were killed in the mass shooting: Antonio Megalizzi, 29, was an Italian radio journalist who was seriously injured in the attack, but on Friday, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte tweeted that he had died. Conte expressed his sympathy for Megalizzi’s family and girlfriend, lauding him as “a young man with a great passion for journalism.” Megalizzi fell into a coma after being shot in the head, his girlfriend’s father told Ansa, and doctors were unable to operate due to the position of the bullet. Prior to news of his death, there was an outpouring of support for Megalizzi and prayers for his recovery, with his radio station saying their hearts were with his loved ones “in this difficult moment.” Anupong Suebsamarn, whose family owns a noodle factory in Thailand, was not meant to be in Strasbourg after all when the tragedy struck — he and his wife changed their travel plans due to the protest in Paris. https://t.co/uWu2Y2ME64 #StrasbourgShooting Anupong Suebsamarn, a 45-year-old Thai tourist, was confirmed by Thailand officials to be among those killed in the attack. “Thailand shares France’s loss and stands with France in condemning this terrorist attack,” Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said in a statement. “The abominable act reminds us that terrorism knows no borders and requires a global response.” According to Thairath, a Thai newspaper, Anupong had traveled to Strasbourg with his wife, Naiyana. They intended to visit Paris, but switched cities due to the violent Yellow Vests protests. Anupong reportedly ran his family’s noodle factory. His parents have declined to speak to the media. Kamal Naghchband, 45, was also among the fatalities, the mosque he attended in Strasbourg announced Wednesday. Naghchband was a father of three and a mechanic, the Grande Mosquée Eyyûb Sultan tweeted. His brother, Mokhtar Naghchband, told Euronews his brother moved to France from Afghanistan 18 years ago. “We are bereaved because our city of Strasbourg, an exemplary city in terms of living together, was hit hard by a murderous act,” Eyup Şahin, regional president of Strasbourg’s Eyyûb Sultan Mosque, said in a statement published by Euronews. This post will be updated as more information about the shooting victims becomes available. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s name was misspelled in an earlier version of this post.

          / CBS/AP A recommendation to allow for armed teachers in classrooms by the state panel investigating the February mass shooting at a Florida high school is drawing controversy. The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission voted 13-1 Wednesday to recommend the state Legislature allow teachers who volunteer and undergo extensive background checks and training be allowed to carry concealed guns on campus to stop future shootings. The commission said it's not enough to have one or two police officers or armed guards on campus. Florida law adopted after the Feb. 14 shooting allows districts to arm non-teaching staff members such as principals, librarians and custodians — 13 of the 67 districts do, mostly in rural parts of the state. The Parkland shooting left 17 people dead and spurred a group of students from the school to become vocal activists for stronger gun control measures. The commission met Wednesday and Thursday to finalize a more than 400-page draft report. They are expected to deliver the findings to Governor Rick Scott by Jan. 1. Supporters argue that even the best response by law enforcement will likely take two to three minutes to confront a shooter, while teachers could immediately. But critics say adding guns will make schools less safe and that teachers should not also have to be armed guards. Among the opponents of the recommendation are state teachers' unions and some family members of victims of the school shooting. Commissioner Max Schachter, whose 14-year-old son Alex died in the massacre, cast the lone vote against the motion. He said the state should focus on hiring more police officers for campuses and allowing non-teaching staff to carry guns. ""We do need more good guys with a gun on campus — nobody understands that and wishes we had more at Marjory Stoneman Douglas than myself,"" Schachter said. But arming teachers ""creates a host of problems."" Debbi Hixon, the widow of school athletics director Chris Hixon, who was slain in the massacre, also voiced opposition to the plan to CBS affiliate WCTV. ""Even if a teacher thinks they're up to that task, I just think it's unfair to have that expectation for them,"" said Hixon. U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, whose district includes Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has said law enforcement's duty to protect the community shouldn't be pushed ""on to civilians that should be focused on educating their students."" The Florida Education Association, the state's largest teachers union, argues guns in the classroom would put students in harm's way, reports WCTV. ""The line in the sand is this: teachers want to teach,"" said FEA President Fedrick Ingram told the station. ""They don't want to carry guns. That is the responsibility of trained professionals."" Rob Kriete, president of the Hillsborough Classroom Teachers Association, told television station WFTS that arming teachers would be ""absurd."" He advocated instead for the state to provide funding for mental health services for students. ""You are putting a band-aid on a gaping wound that is really the mental health issues we really need to get to. And we feel like in this state we need to start funding that properly,"" Kriete told the station. ""Get psychologists [and] the wrap-around services kids need at the school."" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, the commission's chairman, has pushed the proposal to arm trained teachers. He said most deaths in school shootings happen within the first few minutes, before officers on and off campus can respond. He said suspect Nikolas Cruz stopped to reload his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle five times, all of which would have been opportunities for an armed teacher to shoot him. ""We have to give people a fighting chance, we have to give them an opportunity to protect themselves,"" Gualtieri said. He said there aren't enough officers or money to hire one for every school, but even then officers need backup. ""One good guy with a gun on campus is not enough."" Florida's Senate president Bill Galvano said Thursday he is ""very open"" to the proposal. He said he wants a ""realistic conversation"" about what arming teachers would accomplish and that he plans to speak to opponents like the state teachers union and PTA. Currently, teachers in 28 states can carry firearms, according to the Crime Prevention Research Center, a conservative nonprofit organization. District approval is required in most states and restrictions and training requirements vary. First published on December 14, 2018 / 3:56 PM © 2018 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The news comes a day after police killed suspected shooter Cherif Chekatt, 29, after a shootout with police after an intense two-day manhunt that involved hundreds of officers. The attack on Tuesday left another dozen people injured. After the shooting, the government raised the terror alert level nationwide and deployed 1,800 additional soldiers across France to help patrol streets and secure crowded events. One of the four dead was identified Friday as Italian journalist Antonio Megalizzi by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. French authorities did not confirm the name of the fourth person who died. Conte tweeted his condolences to Megalizzi’s relatives and girlfriend, and called the 29-year-old “a young man with the passion of journalism, radio, investigations and European institutions."" Europhonica radio tweeted: “We sadly have to confirm that our colleague Antonio has left us. Our thoughts go to the family and all Antonio’s friends and colleagues. We ask you to respect the sad moment."" Also Friday, Strasbourg reopened the Christmas market where the attack took place under heavy security, Reuters reported. “It's reopening just in time,"" stall-holder Bernard Kuntz, preparing his scarves and stoles imported from India, told the agency. “We were getting worried. Some of the guys have taken out loans to be here, and we've already lost two days,” Kuntz said. French President Emmanuel Macron visited the market on Friday to pay respects to the victims. He laid a flower at a memorial and stood for a moment of reflection, and also thanked security forces and first responders. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2018-12-14 10:26:00,Fourth person dies after Strasbourg Christmas market mass shooting,,34663,http://www.breakingnews.com#spider

House Democrats hold first committee hearing on Capitol riot News By Ruth Brown Submit December 14, 2018 | 11:27am Sandy Hook Elementary School was evacuated due to a bomb threat Friday morning — on the sixth anniversary of the mass shooting at the Newtown, Connecticut, school. The threat came in around 9 a.m., WFSB TV reports. Police don’t consider it credible, but still dismissed all of the students for the day. It was not related to online bomb threats that flooded inboxes across the country on Thursday, police told the news outlet.

The department and Mayor Martin J. Walsh coordinated the gun buyback with physicians and medical professionals to mark the sixth anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The shooting on Dec. 14, 2012, killed 26 people, including 20 children. Saturday’s buyback was held at six locations around the city. In exchange for firearms, participants could receive a $100 Target gift card funded by Mass General Hospital for Children and the Massachusetts General Physicians Organization for surrendering their firearms.   According to police data, there have been 192 shootings, 45 of which have been fatal, from the first of the year through Dec. 9 in Boston. In that same period, there have been 441 firearm-related arrests, according to police.  ©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC  Stay up to date with everything Boston.

According to NFL Network, Kraft arrived in Pittsburgh a day early to visit the Tree of Life synagogue before attending services at another local synagogue, Rodef Shalom. He addressed the congregation at the rabbi’s request, telling the group that his experience with them was “bigger” to him than Sunday’s highly anticipated AFC matchup. The 77-year-old, who has spearheaded multiple trips to Israel as an NFL ambassador, spoke partly in Hebrew.   Against the Steelers Sunday, Edelman will be wearing a pair of customized cleats in remembrance of those fallen at the Tree of Life synagogue. He posted a photo of the cleats on social media and included the names of the 11 victims in his caption. Sunday’s not the first time Edelman has shown his support in the months since the massacre. For New England’s game against the Green Bay Packers on Nov. 4, he wore an Israeli baseball cap in solidarity. “Just let the people out in Pittsburgh know we’re thinking about them,” he said after the Patriots’ 31-17 win. “We’re sending them vibes and our prayers. That was a big hit to the community and it’s uncalled for. Just letting them know, ‘Hey, I’m behind you and I’m supporting you.'”   https://www.instagram.com/p/BrdJWVeHpwM/  ©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC  Stay up to date with everything Boston.

218,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/12/16/d-c-proposal-would-let-police-take-guns-from-people-accused-of-domestic-abuse/,"Trending: By Peter Hermann | The Washington Post WASHINGTON — The D.C. Council on Tuesday could pass new laws restricting the ability of gun owners to modify weapons and require police to seize guns while enforcing protective orders in domestic disputes. The latter provision — known as a “red flag law” — is gaining popularity, with variants implemented in more than a dozen states, including Maryland. The D.C. version would mandate that authorities take firearms out of the hands of suspected abusers more quickly than is permitted under existing laws. Other proposed laws, if passed, would the ban rapid-fire attachments known as bump stocks and increase penalties for extended magazines, accessories that allow guns to fire faster and hold more bullets. The package, the Firearms Safety Omnibus Amendment Act, unanimously passed the council during its first hearing on Dec. 4. The final vote is Tuesday. D.C. Councilman Charles Allen, D-Ward 6, chairman of the public safety committee, called the package “smart legislation that looks at how we address gun violence.” He said it makes sense to remove, even temporarily, firearms “from someone expressing they will do harm to themselves or others.” The D.C. Public Defenders Service opposed the bills at a public hearing in March, saying it was concerned that authorities would have too much latitude to seize weapons. It also said the gun-accessory restrictions are unnecessary because such items are regulated under existing laws. By law, a judge cannot order firearms seizures until after a temporary restraining order, in place for 14 days, expires and a more expansive order is implemented — typically after a court hearing in which both sides can present arguments. The new law would require the subject of a temporary restraining order to surrender firearms. Failure to do so would be considered unlawful possession of a firearm and carry a penalty of two to 10 years in prison. “The risk of homicide is 20 times higher after a domestic dispute, and removing guns from these situations makes sense,” D.C. Councilwoman Mary Cheh, D-Ward 3, said at a hearing on the bill in March. She said the first few days after the temporary restraining order “is the most dangerous period for the victim.” The law also would allow law enforcement to petition a court to remove firearms and ammunition from a person deemed to be a significant danger to others, a provision called an “extreme-risk protective order.” In November, a police officer in Maryland fatally shot a man while serving such an order after authorities said the man became angry and grabbed a gun. Bump stocks are used to accelerate the firing of semiautomatic rifles, essentially turning them into fully automatic military-style weapons. They are already prohibited in the District. A bump stock was used by the gunman in the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas. The shooter opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers, firing 1,100 rounds, which killed 58 people and wounded 851. The bill also would add to the penalties for people caught with a gun magazine that can hold more than 10 bullets, increasing it from a misdemeanor with a maximum one-year sentence to a felony that carries a sentence of up to three years. A rifle with a high-capacity magazine was used by one of four shooters who opened fire in a Northeast Washington courtyard in August, killing 10-year-old Makiyah Wilson in a hail of 76 bullets. The administration of Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser supports the package of proposed laws, but it objects to an immunity clause that says the subject of a protective order who has illegal firearms seized cannot be criminally charged. D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham sent a letter to the council noting the objections. “It will, ultimately, create an environment more accepting of illegal guns and the crimes they are used to commit,” the chief wrote in the letter. He called the immunity measure a “highly unusual and, I believe, counterproductive step” and said extending the protective-order process to protect illegal guns “will undermine efforts to protect the community and other potential victims of violence.” Allen defended the provision, saying many times loved ones or friends are reluctant to call police “because they are concerned about the criminal consequences” even though they “want to be able to remove the firearm.” This, he said, “is aimed at making sure people do the right thing.” Katerina Semyonova, the policy counsel for the D.C. Public Defender Service, testified in March that the bills would add to “confusing and overlapping” gun laws in the District. Semyonova said gun accessories such as large-capacity magazines “are already amply covered in code.” She added: “There are no gaps in the District’s ability to prosecute illegal possession of firearms. . . . The District does not need new laws for ancillary offenses.” She also objected to the protective orders, saying her office is concerned that under both provisions, judges and police will be allowed to seize weapons without allowing the owners due process – a chance to object in court.

221,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/-cMSta3s9J4/,"The incoming Democrat House majority is readying legislation to criminalize private gun sales. Ironically, the push comes nearly 227 years to the day after private gun ownership was hedged in by the Founding Fathers via the Second Amendment, which was ratified on December 15, 1791. Politico reports that Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) is spearheading the current gun control push through “universal background” legislation. Such checks criminalize private gun sales, making it illegal for a neighbor to sell a firearm to his neighbor, a friend to his lifelong friend, and even a father to his son. Under the Democrats’ plan, a background system like that in California would require a gun seller to seek government permission for any sale or transfer of a firearm. Such a system was put in place in California in the early 1990s and has failed to prevent some of our nation’s most heinous mass public attacks. Breitbart News’s Joel Pollack observed: Note that @Politico assumes whatever legislation Democrats propose to control guns will also curb ""gun violence."" The reason #2A advocates have objected to past efforts is that there is no cause-and-effect.  https://t.co/AE0caCNnkp cc: @BresPolitico, @heatherscope, @lbarronlopez — Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) December 17, 2018 Nevertheless, Thompson expects to push his gun control bill within “the first 100 days” of the new Congress. Incoming House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) has already assured his colleagues that he will move the bill “very quickly” once it is introduced. The criminalization of private gun sales would not have stopped a single 21st century mass shooting, as nearly every mass shooter bought his firearms at retail via a background check. The exceptions to this norm are the two or three mass shooters who stole their guns.

222,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/12/17/video-berkeley-man-to-be-sentenced-in-three-phase-terror-plot-told-judge-everything-was-a-joke-to-me/,"Trending:  SAN FRANCISCO — An Oakland man hoped to kill 10,000 Bay Area residents, according to court records that reveal a chilling plan of planting bombs around Oakland and UC Berkeley, blowing up a gay bar in San Francisco, setting arson fires around the Berkeley hills and distributing poisoned cocaine in local night clubs. Amer Alhaggagi, whose last name is also spelled “Al-Haggagi” in court records, was caught on video discussing the plots with an undercover FBI agent. Alhaggagi pleaded guilty in July to attempting to give material aid to a terrorist organization, stemming from when he helped set up propaganda social media accounts for people connected to the Islamic State, known as ISIL and ISIS. He also pleaded guilty to three identity-theft counts. He appeared in federal court Monday for a sentencing hearing, which was continued to next month. “I want to make it to a point where every American here thinks twice or three times before he leaves his home,” Alhaggagi said on the video, which was obtained by KQED. “Like, ‘Is it necessary for me to leave right now?’ That’s how I want it to be.” But in a letter to the court, Alhaggagi claimed the purported plots were fantasies he concocted out of boredom and said he had no intentions of committing terrorism. “Everything was a joke to me, … I didn’t think anyone was taking me seriously,” Alhaggagi wrote to the court. “I do not support any terrorist organization, or any organization for that matter. It truly saddens me to acknowledge and own up to the fact that it took me to come to this calaboose to elevate my mind from the vacuous state that it was in. I feel really bad for the harm I’ve caused everyone and wasting the FBIs (sic) valuable time.” Alhaggagi faces up to 47 years in federal prison. Prosecutors asked for a sentence of 33 years, and defense attorneys argued for a far lower figure: four years in prison followed by federal probation. This case is only the latest in recent memory that involved allegations of a Bay Area terrorist plot in the making. Last year, a Modesto man was charged with plotting a bombing and mass shooting at Pier 39 in San Francisco. He was sentenced to 15 years. In 2014, a San Jose man was implicated in a terror plot in Oakland. Terrorist or internet troll? According to court records, Alhaggagi was born in Lodi and attended Berkeley High School from 2008 to 2012. Afterward he worked briefly at Andronico’s grocery store and took college classes. Several friends and family members — including a Berkeley High teacher — wrote letters of support to the court, calling him friendly and peaceful. But online, Alhaggagi took on a different persona. He spoke of a desire to kill “gays and Jews” in particular and said he wanted to kill UC Berkeley students because “they think they are better than everyone else.” When agents searched his home, they reportedly found a note claiming responsibility for the planned attacks and saying they were done in the name of ISIS. He said the attack would have three phases: The first would be poisoning “infidels,” then setting a gasoline fire in the Berkeley hills during the day, then a series of bomb attacks. He wrote that he hoped the attacks would inspire copycats. “As for the final operation, it is only if I were to be exposed and unable to leave the country; if I were surrounded in an area; a direct confrontation with security; either the police or army, the end will be an explosive belt after the ammunition runs out,” he wrote. Alhaggagi’s lawyer described his client as an internet troll who had a lifelong fascination with getting a rise out of people by coming up with offensive things to say. He said Alhaggagi took this to an extreme end on the internet, but those who knew him well say he would never actually harm others. The defense pointed out that Alhaggagi never bought bomb-making material, despite saying he would. “Amer Alhaggagi is not a terrorist. He is neither radicalized nor dangerous,” his attorneys Mary McNamara and August Gugelmann wrote in a sentencing brief. They later added: “He believed none of what he said, was surprised when anyone took him seriously and, in fact, is something of a coward. He is truly remorseful for (and mortified by) his atrocious online behavior and what he has put everyone through.” Federal authorities responded that any attempts to paint Alhaggagi’s actions as “a lark” are “purely false” and that his “appetite for evil knows no bounds.” Cat and mouse game with the FBI During the FBI investigation, Alhaggagi reportedly had internet chats with members of ISIS, including a 17-year-old who later admitted to authorities he was part of United Cyber Caliphate, a hacker branch of ISIL. He also spoke with an FBI informant who introduced him to an undercover FBI agent who claimed to have ties to Al-Qaeda. Alhaggagi met with the agent multiple times and discussed in detail ways to kill hundreds or thousands of people. During their talks, Alhaggagi claimed his uncle in Yemen was a friend of Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni-American imam described by U.S. officials as a recruiter and planner for Al-Qaeda. Al-Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011. Prosecutors say Alhaggagi eventually became suspicious that the undercover agent wasn’t who he claimed to be and questioned the agent — who made several missteps — about his knowledge of Iran and other subjects. When the agent expressed sympathy for Iran, Alhaggagi became suspicious, even more so when the agent failed to recognize the leader of Al-Qaeda by name. At their final meeting in Oakland, Alhaggagi reportedly invented a ruse and ran from the agent, and they never crossed paths again. Federal prosecutors called this proof that Alhaggagi had figured out the agent’s true identity, but Alhaggagi’s attorney said it was evidence that Alhaggagi never intended to commit a terrorist attack. In his letter, Alhaggagi said that after he met with the FBI agent, he began to believe the man was actually plotting terrorist attacks and became extremely concerned. He said his plan was to blow off the agent indefinitely. After the last meeting, he stayed off the internet for more than a month, he wrote, but then went “back to messing with people on the internet especially the ISIS guys.” “It was a mixture of imprudence and boredom and as I had stated in the very beginning of this paper, I was in a funk! What can I say but that I should of known better, but regretfully I didn’t,” he wrote. But federal authorities say they have further proof Alhaggagi fully intended to carry out plots: After Alhaggagi was arrested on identity theft charges in November 2016 — before the terrorism charge was filed — two jail inmates came forward saying he had approached them about planning more attacks. The inmates’ statements were filed under seal. Alhaggagi will be sentenced on Jan. 8, according to federal prosecutors.

You don’t heal from that overnight.” Mowry’s niece, Alaina Housley, 18, was one of more than a dozen victims of the shooting at Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, on November 7. “Our hearts are broken,” Mowry and her husband, Adam Housley, said in a statement to Us on November 8. “Alaina was an incredible young woman with so much life ahead of her and we are devastated that her life was cut short in this manner.” Bailon told Us that Mowry is advocating for change on her late niece’s behalf. “I don’t think people recognize gun violence and how it affects everyone,” she said. “It’s a ripple effect, and I think if my heart was broken, I can’t even imagine how [Alaina’s] parents feel, how they felt. It’s just heartbreaking. I think that [Mowry] definitely is doing a great job at saying, ‘I’m moving forward and living my life with Alaina’s voice in mind and speaking up for her and what she would have wanted.’” The former 3LW singer also applauded the Sister, Sister alum for her resilience in the midst of such grief. “It comes in waves,” she added. “It’s from laughter to ‘My gosh, I experienced a real loss.’ It’s hard. [But] she’s a lot stronger than she knows, and I think she’s recognizing that with every step.” Hours after the shooting, Mowry paid tribute to her niece with an Instagram slideshow. “My sweet, sweet Alaina,” she wrote in the caption. “My heart breaks. I’m still in disbelief. It’s not fair how you were taken and how soon you were taken from us. I was blessed to know you ever since you were 5. You stole my heart … I love you. I love you. I love you.

224,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/ZgdTKT4oVVw/advertisers-ditch-fox-news-tucker-carlson-for-saying-immigration-makes-us-dirtier,"SEARCH Four advertisers, including Indeed and Pacific Life, say they have no plans to advertise on the Fox News host’s show in the future. Media reporter Several advertisers have dropped Tucker Carlson’s show after the Fox News host suggested last week that immigrants are making the United States “dirtier.” Last Thursday, Carlson ran a segment arguing against the economic benefits of immigration in which he claimed the influx of low-skilled workers “makes our own country poor and dirtier and more divided.” “Nobody even tries to defend it,” Tucker said of workers without a college education coming to the U.S. “Instead, our leaders demand that you shut up and accept it. We have a moral obligation to admit the world’s poor, they tell us, even if it makes our own country poor and dirtier and more divided.” At least four advertisers were not pleased with Carlson’s comments. On Friday, Pacific Life announced that it would not advertise on Carlson’s show, and the company would “reevaluate our relationship with his program.” “As a company, we strongly disagree with Mr. Carlson’s statements,” the company said last week. “Our customer base and our workforce reflect the diversity of our great nation, something we we take great pride in. We will not be advertising on Mr. Carlson’s show in the coming weeks as we reevaluate our relationship with his program.” On Monday, jobs site Indeed followed suit, saying it had no plans to advertise on Carlson’s show in the future. The parent company of fitness brand Bowflex also said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter that it would no longer be advertising on his program. Online design marketplace Minted also announced Monday they would be dropping Carlson's show from their advertising buys. “We do not agree with Mr. Carlson's comments and his opinions are not consistent with the values we hold at Minted,” the company wrote in a tweet. “Like other advertisers, our media purchases are done broadly across a number of networks.” Other advertisers have stuck with the Fox News host. Farmers Insurance, one of the program's advertisers, said in a statement to The Daily Beast that the company's ad buying decisions should not be portrayed as political. ""Farmers invests in advertising across a broad range of networks and programs that reflect the diversity of opinions and viewpoints found across the nation,"" the company said in a statement. ""Advertising decisions made by Farmers should not be construed to be an endorsement of any kind as to a show’s content or the individuals appearing on the show."" Mitsubishi, another advertiser, told The Daily Beast it did not consider politics as a factor when making ad buys. “Our advertising media spend is determined based on demographics and psychographics, not politics,” a company spokesperson said. “Our strategic marketing intent is to share our key product news with consumers through a variety of media channels. We will monitor the situation and adjust our advertising if necessary.” In a statement, a Fox News spokesperson said it is was a “shame that left-wing advocacy groups, under the guise of being supposed ‘media watchdogs’ weaponize social media against companies in an effort to stifle free speech. We continue to stand by and work with our advertisers through these unfortunate and unnecessary distractions.” During his show on Monday, Carlson defended his comments, saying various government statistics showed that illegal immigration has damaged natural landscape in the American Southwest. “We're not intimidated,” he said. “We plan to try to say what’s true until the last day. And the truth is unregulated mass immigration has badly hurt this country's natural landscape.” Carlson isn’t the first Fox News host to experience an ad boycott this year. A number of Laura Ingraham’s advertisers dropped her show in March after she mocked David Hogg, a teenage survivor of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Several advertisers also boycotted Sean Hannity’s show in 2017 after he was criticized for being too deferential during an interview with former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who was accused of engaging in sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old. Some critics have gone further, arguing for boycotts of Fox’s larger entertainment and media business. Earlier this year, producer Judd Apatow called on staff and showrunners working with 21st Century Fox, the former parent company of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire, to speak out against Fox News.

225,https://hotair.com/archives/2018/12/17/uh-oh-stoneman-douglas-votes-overwhelmingly-arming-trained-teachers/,"This story actually popped up last week but somehow got lost in my inbox for a while. Down in Florida, in the school district where the horrific shooting took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the Stoneman Douglas Commission finally sat down to take a vote on one of many measures being considered to provide additional security for students and teachers in the event of future mass shooting attempts. The subject at hand was the concept of arming teachers who volunteer to undergo rigorous training and carry firearms at work. Given the outrage expressed over the idea by many student activists and virtually everyone in the media, you might think this plan would never get off the ground. But it went the opposite way, with all but one of the commissioners voting in favor of the proposal. (CBS Miami) The Stoneman Douglas Commission voted 13-1 on Wednesday to recommend that qualified teachers who volunteer to carry guns on campus be allowed to do so. “The more people we have appropriately trained and appropriately equipped after their appropriately selected the safer the kids are because we have to get there in seconds,” said Commission Member Grady Judd, Sheriff of Polk County. The idea is a controversial one and it came up repeatedly after the February 14th shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead and 17 others injured. Commission Chair Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said the shooting at MSD proved to him that selected teachers who undergo background checks and extensive training can stop a school shooter. Some of the parents and students were still speaking out against the proposal. (The single vote against the measure was cast by the father of one of the students killed in the attack.) Also, the state teachers union is opposed to the measure. This action doesn’t change existing law or allow the program to go into effect. Rather, the finding of the committee will be passed to the Florida state legislature for consideration. Given their intimate standing with school shootings, it’s possible that the legislature will look upon their recommendation kindly. If they fail to act, what else are the schools supposed to do? They freely admit that they don’t have the resources in their budget to place armed security officers in all of the locations needed throughout the school district. Restricting access to the school brings its own complications, and metal detectors and similar security precautions can also be prohibitively expensive. Sure, you can always dial 9-1-1, but the response time for the best local police units still proves to be too long in many tragic cases. And even if law enforcement arrives promptly, many of these parents are still no doubt wondering what happens if the first person on the scene turns out to be “the Coward of Broward County.” In Florida, as with many districts around the nation, willing, well-trained, armed teachers may be their best line of defense if enough precautions are taken to prevent students from getting hold of the firearms.

        Salvador Hernandez Last updated on December 19, 2018, at 10:27 a.m. ET Posted on December 17, 2018, at 8:23 p.m. ET At least 14 companies have pulled their advertisements from Tucker Carlson's Fox News show after he asserted that immigrants make the US ""poorer and dirtier and more divided."" As of Tuesday, Pacific Life, Indeed, SmileDirectClub, Minted, IHOP, Ancestry.com, CareerBuilder, ScotteVest, Nerdwallet, Zenni, TD Ameritrade, Land Rover, Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Nautilus, the parent company of Bowflex, announced they would suspend their advertising during Tucker Carlson Tonight. Carlson is the latest host on the conservative cable news network to face backlash from advertisers after making controversial comments on the air, prompting critics to launch a social media campaign and pressure advertisers. The latest outrage came after a Thursday night segment where Carlson said immigrants make the US ""poorer and dirtier."" ""We have a moral obligation to admit the world’s poor, [political leaders] tell us, even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided,"" he said. It wasn't the first time Carlson has been critical of the migrant caravan at the southern border, and he has regularly run segments questioning the benefits of diversity in the US. .@pacificlife pulled their ads after this segment, where Tucker Carlson said “We have a moral obligation to accept the world’s poor [political leaders] tell us, even if it makes our own country poorer, and dirtier, and more divided."" By Friday morning, Pacific Life announced that it disagreed with his comments and would ""reevaluate [its] relationship with his program."" ""As a company, we strongly disagree with Mr. Carlson's statements,"" a spokesperson for Pacific Life told BuzzFeed News. ""Our customer base and our workforce reflect the diversity of our great nation, something we take great pride in."" On Monday, Indeed and SmileDirectClub confirmed to BuzzFeed News that they would no longer be advertising with the show. A spokesperson for the job site Indeed told BuzzFeed News the company had not purchased advertising on the show for more than a month, and that it did not plan to do so in the future. ""As a company we are nonpartisan — our site is for everyone, regardless of background or beliefs,"" Tara Lambropoulos, a spokesperson for Indeed told BuzzFeed News. A spokesperson for SmileDirectClub said the company was working with its media buyers to make sure it is ""no longer running [its] ads around any political opinion shows."" Nautilus confirmed its decision to the Hollywood Reporter. Minted, an online retailer of local craft makers, said on Twitter Monday night that it was ""permanently"" cutting its advertising during the show. On Tuesday, IHOP, Nerdwallet, Zenni, Ancestry.com, Land Rover, TD Ameritrade, Takeda Pharmaceuticals and CareerBuilder confirmed to BuzzFeed News they also were ending all advertising during the show.  ""At our core, we stand for welcoming folks from all background and beliefs into our restaurants and continually evaluate ad placements to ensure they align with our values,"" a spokesperson for IHOP told BuzzFeed News in a statement. ""In this case, we will no longer be advertising on this show."" Nerdwallet also cut ties with Carlson's show, stating that it's content didn't ""align with our company values."" ""If our review determines that a certain show's content doesn't align with our company values, we take commensurate and appropriate action,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""That's what we've done in this instance. We've pulled advertising at this time and will be reevaluating any ongoing advertising on this program."" A spokesperson for ScotteVest defended the right to free speech in a statement, but said the company had decided to no longer advertise on Carlson's show. ""We believe that a cornerstone of our democracy is the right to free speech, which sometimes means tolerating opinions that one may disagree with and find distasteful,"" the company said. On Wednesday, Just For Men told BuzzFeed News in a statement that it would no longer be advertising on Carlson's show. ""Just For Men has no further plans to advertise on Tucker Carlson’s show. The brand is always considering ways to remain responsible, and this includes aligning with partners who share our brand values."" In response, Fox News called the campaign against Carlson an effort from ""left-wing advocacy groups."" “It is a shame that left-wing advocacy groups, under the guise of being supposed ‘media watchdogs,’ weaponize social media against companies in an effort to stifle free speech,"" a spokesperson for the network told BuzzFeed News. ""We continue to stand by and work with our advertisers through these unfortunate and unnecessary distractions."" On Tuesday, Fox News criticized some of the organizations that have called for companies to remove their advertising from the show, calling their efforts ""a grossly hypocritical double standard given their intolerance to all opposing points of view."" ""We cannot and will not allow voices like Tucker Carlson to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts from the likes of Moveon.org, Media Matters and Sleeping Giants,"" the network said in a statement. Fox News also compared the online campaign to protests that erupted in front of Carlson's home last month. ""He is once again being threatened via Twitter by far left activist groups with deeply political motives,"" the statement read. A network spokesperson told BuzzFeed News all of the advertisers who have removed their ads from Carlson's show have moved them to other shows on the channel. At least a handful of companies reached by BuzzFeed News said they had no plan to stop advertising on the show. In a statement, Mike Lindell, the CEO of My Pillow said he would not be changing his advertising choices. A spokesperson for Mitsubishi told BuzzFeed News the company's advertising decisions are, ""determined based on demographics and psychographics, not politics."" Still, the spokesperson said, the company would continue to ""monitor the situation."" Addressing the controversy on his show Monday night, Carlson accused ""the enforcers"" of intimidation. ""It won't work for the show. We are not intimidated,"" he said in defending his comments. ""We plan to say what's true until the last day. The truth is, unregulated mass immigration has badly hurt this country's natural landscape."" Carlson isn't the only Fox News commentator to lose advertisers after controversial comments. More than two dozen companies removed their ads from Laura Ingraham's program in March after the host mocked a high school mass shooting survivor from Parkland, Florida. Several companies also pulled their ads from Sean Hannity's show late last year over his coverage of sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. Matt Rivitz, the founder of Sleeping Giants, a group that has targeted conservative and right-wing media outlets in the past, told BuzzFeed News he had sent a letter to Carlson's advertisers in September highlighting his comments on diversity, asking if they wanted to be associated with his views. An open letter to the corporations sponsoring Tucker Carlson Tonight. The letter followed a September segment in which Carlson asked, ""How precisely is diversity our strength?"" But Rivitz noted that none of the advertisers who were forwarded the letter responded at the time. Thursday's segment, however, took off on social media. The Murdoch family is a family of immigrants. Everyone’s family is a family of immigrants. @TuckerCarlson is a an idiot who doesn’t understand who we all are. How can anyone advertise on a show which spouts hate? What would it take for people to care? https://t.co/cgpjdElZh2 Among those who reached out to Carlson's advertisers on social media was Judd Apatow, a writer, producer, and director who has retweeted others asking companies to stop advertising on the show. ""This time, in no uncertain terms, he said that immigrants make our country more poor and dirty, and that is extremely xenophobic and incredibly racist to us,"" Rivitz said. ""This is something that happens every week.""      Salvador Hernandez is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles. Contact Salvador Hernandez at salvador.hernandez@buzzfeed.com.

But not one story out of the White House cracked USA TODAY's most-read articles in 2018, a collection of storylines that mix nostalgia and curiosity alongside heartbreaking tragedy and the occasionally provocative detail. From the beginnings of a drug recall and a march against gun violence to the end of  Toys R Us and TV's ""Roseanne,"" here's what caught your attention this year. We didn't want to grow up. We were Toys R Us kids Even in the age of two-day delivery, national brick-and-mortar stores still hold our attention — at least when they close. The internet's disruption of retail hit a nostalgic brand this year in Toys R Us, which closed all stores nationwide in June after faltering under bankruptcy protection. Specifically, readers cared about their local stores: A state-by-state look at Toys R Us closures in January became our most-read story of 2018. And while mascot Geoffrey popped up in Kroger stores for the holiday season, Toys R Us wasn't the only retail giant to shutter stores. Sam's Club closed 63 locations as well, with a state-by-state guide also among our 10 most-read articles. Split California? Many have tried (and failed) A long-shot effort to split California's statehood gripped the imagination of many in January, when the self-described founders of ""New California"" read their Declaration of Independence from the nation's most populous state. Describing California as ""governed by a tyranny,"" the group envisioned claiming most of current-day California — including many rural counties — and leaving coastal urban areas behind. It's the latest in a long line of 200-plus attempts to split the Golden State, all of which failed. In June, California's Supreme Court blocked a different measure to split the state into three as Northern California, Southern California and regular ol' California. Blood pressure medications with a possible cancer risk Potentially cancer-causing chemicals found in common blood pressure medications over the summer sparked a series of recalls as the Food and Drug Administration looked into the cause of the tainted drugs. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said recalls of versions of valsartan, irbesartan and losartan reflected increased scrutiny on drug safety, with the agency hiring hired dozens of chemists to review pharmaceutical companies and their techniques. The contaminated drugs were originally traced to a large factory in China and later a second in India, both using a similar manufacturing process to supply valsartan to generic drug companies worldwide. She tried to hang a toddler. A judge gave her probation She hanged a toddler in her basement before running over two men in her minivan. All survived, miraculously, and former Minneapolis day care provider Nataliia Karia received 10 years probation in July after pleading guilty to attempted murder and criminal vehicular operation. ""This offense was aggravated, if not wholly caused, by abuse of Nataliia's husband,"" defense attorney Brockton Hunter said, describing mental illness brought on by an abusive husband. A judge handed down a 183 month stayed prison sentence if Karia violates her probation. After a mass shooting at school, Florida students marched for their lives Parkland became the site of a mass school shooting when a former student killed 17 people, including students, a football coach and an athletic director, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine’s Day. Police arrested Nikolas Cruz, who now faces the death penalty among other charges. Cruz was known to police, who had received 18 calls between 2008 and 2017 warning about him – some directly concerned about him opening fire at the Florida high school. Math teacher Jim Gard was called a hero for protecting students in his classroom during the rampage, an account at least two students called false. Parkland students emerged from the tragedy fueling a movement and marches against gun violence across the nation that also targeted NRA-backed candidates in midterm elections. Michelle and George W.: America's BFFs Sure, her husband took his job, but after years of sitting together at official events, Michelle Obama said that George W. Bush has become her ""partner in crime."" ""I love him to death,"" Obama said on NBC's ""Today"" show in October, citing the official protocol that seats the former first lady and the ex-president together at all official gatherings of presidents past and present. The BFF status became cemented when Bush slyly passed Obama a cough drop during the September funeral of the late Sen. John McCain. Bush echoed the moment three months later at the funeral of his father, former President George H.W. Bush. Roseanne's return to TV ended by a tweet ""Roseanne"" returned to TV in March, two decades after it first ended 1997, with an original cast including John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf and, yes, Roseanne Barr. The two-episode premier drew 18.2 million viewers in preliminary Nielsen ratings — enough for ABC to quickly order another season. Offscreen, however, Barr drew flack for her offensive tweets, with the final straw landing in May. ABC canceled the show that month following a racist tweet from the star targeting former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, a post the actress later blamed on Ambien. A spinoff, ""The Conners,"" debuted in the fall without Roseanne. Mollie Tibbetts went missing. An immigration debate ensued Mollie Tibbetts was last seen running along Boundary and Middle Streets in her Iowa hometown on July 18, surveillance footage shows. The 20-year-old University of Iowa student was reported missing the next day, sparking a monthlong search that gripped Americans from Iowa to the White House. ""I just want Mollie's family to know: You're on the hearts of every American,"" Vice President Mike Pence said Aug. 15. Authorities found her body in a cornfield  six days later, and charged Cristhian Rivera, a 24-year-old Mexican national, with first-degree murder. Rivera, who led police to the body, said he ""blocked"" his memory after pursuing Tibbetts during her run. He pleaded not guilty to the charge, and Tibbetts became the face of an the immigration debate — against her father's pleas. An Olympian devastated by a wardrobe flub An untimely wardrobe mishap took the shine of an Olympian's Winter Games performance when French ice dancer Gabriella Papadakis' halter top unfastened during a routine. As Papadakis threw herself backward on the final element of the performance, her costume rode upwards in a revealing manner on live TV and on replay screens across the arena in South Korea. ""I think we should be proud we were able to deliver a strong performance with that happening,"" Papadakis later said. She and partner Guillaume Cizeron later rebounded to claim silver medals. A Navy chaplain fired after sex outside a New Orleans bar A Marine Reserve spokesman declined to say why Navy Capt. Loften Thornton was fired in March from his job as chaplain to a Marine Forces Reserve based in New Orleans. But Denfense officials later confirmed that authorities had video showing Thronton having sex with a woman outside a British-themed pub near the French Quarter. The Marines have struggled with sexual misconduct, including a 2017 scandal of Marines sharing explicit photos of women without their consent.

The commission, which was put together after the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., recommends in a report released Tuesday supporting a temporary order to take away guns from those deemed to be a danger to themselves and others, while respecting due process and ""Second Amendment liberties.""
Advertisement President Donald Trump said Tuesday the purpose of the report was ""to prevent school shootings and keep our children safe."" ""Nothing is more important than protecting our nation's children,"" Trump said.
RELATED Parkland panel advises arming teachers to handle school attacks The commission also recommends that school districts work with law enforcement to establish a method to have ""highly-trained individuals"" on campus with weapons. A senior administration official told reporters on a conference call Tuesday the report does not specifically recommend arming teachers, but said the average time of a mass shooting attack is three to four minutes -- and police response time is eight minutes, at the earliest.
Advertisement Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, told reporters the recommendations were made after the panel heard testimony from students, school officials, law enforcement and lawmakers around the country. ""The report addresses a holistic view of school safety based on the insights, experience and expertise of these individuals,"" DeVos said. ""We do not propose one-size-fits-all solutions for everyone. Local problems need local solutions. We have identified options policymakers should explore.""
RELATED March For Our Lives activists, others honored at Smithsonian awards DeVos said the report encourages better access to mental health services so people can receive the treatment they need, including a need to modernize federal privacy laws. One policy DeVos suggested Tuesday was one that doesn't identify or show photos of school shooters. It also urges school institutions to partner with local law enforcement in the training and arming of school personnel and placing veterans and retired law enforcement officers to serve in a variety of school roles. ""States and local communities should consider incentivizing these folks to pursue careers in education, as well as work to reduce barriers to certifications,"" DeVos said.
RELATED After Parkland: A timeline of gun-control activism, legislation Administration officials said the commission heard repeated discontent for Obama-era guidelines set in 2014 to alert school districts of potential civil rights law violations if black students or students of other racial minorities are suspended, expelled or disciplined in other ways at higher rates than white students.
Advertisement The commission chose to focus on the Obama guidelines partly because Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz, a former MSD student, was a participant in Broward County's Promise program, which provides an alternative to arrest for some students. ""One of the things that the commission was concerned with was the reoccurring narrative that teachers in the classroom, or students in the hallways, on campus were afraid because individuals who had a history of anti-social or aggressive, trending toward violent behavior were left unpunished or left unchecked,"" a senior administration official said. ""That's the first move the report makes is to correct for that problem."" Although the Florida Promise program was launched a year before the Obama guidelines were put into place, it has been viewed as an early example of the kind of initiatives schools may implement to lessen the racial disparities in regard to discipline. Tuesday's report also touched on other issues, like violent entertainment and school building security. Andrew Pollack, father of Parkland victim Meadow Pollack, joined Trump and DeVos in discussing the report at the White House referring to it as ""the most comprehensive report by any administration on a school shooting.""

Nor does the threat of gun violence. Life in this busy, complex city feels safe enough to put a limit on fear. Crime is real, yet for most people, most of the time, it is also abstract. The reality is different for Chicago police officers. With every shift they take, officers accept the risk that Chicago’s dark culture of gun violence will place them in danger. Or stop their lives cold. That has happened in three incidents in 2018, resulting in the deaths of four sworn members of the Chicago Police Department. On Monday evening, Officers Eduardo Marmolejo, 36, and Conrad Gary, 31, responded to a call for service on the Far South Side after a report of shots fired. They were on railroad tracks doing surveillance when they were struck and killed by an outbound South Shore train at 103rd Street and Dauphin Avenue around 6:20 p.m. The deaths of these officers, young men who were in the early stages of their careers, is crushing for their families, their department, their city. Grief and frustration feel heightened by the fact that two other CPD members were killed this year. In February, Cmdr. Paul Bauer, 53, was shot and killed while chasing a suspect to a stairwell outside the Thompson Center in the Loop. In November, Officer Samuel Jimenez, 28, was killed in the mass shooting at Mercy Hospital & Medical Center on the Near South Side. Dr. Tamara O’Neal, 38, and pharmacist Dayna Less, 24, also were slain in that incident. Four officers down, four line-of-duty deaths, in 10 months.

231,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-edit-chicago-police-officers-killed-gun-20181218-story.html,"Shootings and killings do not define Chicago. Nor does the threat of gun violence. Life in this busy, complex city feels safe enough to put a limit on fear. Crime is real, yet for most people, most of the time, it is also abstract. The reality is different for Chicago police officers. With every shift they take, officers accept the risk that Chicago’s dark culture of gun violence will place them in danger. Or stop their lives cold. That has happened in three incidents in 2018, resulting in the deaths of four sworn members of the Chicago Police Department. On Monday evening, Officers Eduardo Marmolejo, 36, and Conrad Gary, 31, responded to a call for service on the Far South Side after a report of shots fired. They were on railroad tracks doing surveillance when they were struck and killed by an outbound South Shore train at 103rd Street and Dauphin Avenue around 6:20 p.m. The deaths of these officers, young men who were in the early stages of their careers, is crushing for their families, their department, their city. Grief and frustration feel heightened by the fact that two other CPD members were killed this year. In February, Cmdr. Paul Bauer, 53, was shot and killed while chasing a suspect to a stairwell outside the Thompson Center in the Loop. In November, Officer Samuel Jimenez, 28, was killed in the mass shooting at Mercy Hospital & Medical Center on the Near South Side. Dr. Tamara O’Neal, 38, and pharmacist Dayna Less, 24, also were slain in that incident. Four officers down, four line-of-duty deaths, in 10 months.

232,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-admin-bump-stocks-ban,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration moved Tuesday to officially ban bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms, and has made them illegal to possess beginning in late March. The devices will be banned under a federal law that prohibits machine guns, according to a senior Justice Department official. Bump stocks became a focal point of the national gun control debate after they were used in October 2017 when a man opened fired from his Las Vegas hotel suite into a crowd at a country music concert below, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The regulation, which was signed by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker on Tuesday morning, will go into effect 90 days after it is formally published in the Federal Register, which is expected to happen on Friday, the Justice Department official said. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly ahead of the regulation’s formal publication and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. In March, President Donald Trump said his administration would “ban” the devices, which he said “turn legal weapons into illegal machines.” Shortly after the president’s comments, the Justice Department announced that it had started the process to amend federal firearms regulations to define bump stocks as machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sought public comment on the proposal, drawing more than 35,000 comments. The amended regulations reverse a 2010 ATF decision that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress changed existing firearms law or passed a new one. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, there was a growing push by some members of Congress to ban bump stocks, but no legislation was passed. At least 10 states have sought their own restrictions on the devices. People who own bump stocks will be required to either surrender them to the ATF or destroy them by late March, the official said. The change has undergone a legal review and the Justice Department and ATF are ready to fight any legal challenge that may be brought, the official added. Police said the gunman in the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock, fired for more than 10 minutes using multiple weapons outfitted with target scopes and bump stocks. Paddock fatally shot himself after the shooting and there were 23 assault-style weapons, including 14 fitted with rapid-fire “bump stock” devices, strewn about the room near his body on the floor of his 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel. The largest manufacturer of bump stocks, Slide Fire Solutions, announced in April that it was going to stop taking orders and shutting down its website. The remaining stock of the devices is now being sold by another company, RW Arms, based in Fort Worth, Texas. (This post has been updated.) A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things.

        Dominic Holden Posted on December 18, 2018, at 11:28 a.m. ET The Trump administration on Tuesday issued a final rule that bans so-called bump stocks, devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to fire more rapidly, saying tens of thousands of them around the country must be destroyed or surrendered to federal law enforcement. The rule could now tee up a possible lawsuit challenging the ban. The rule will take effect after 90 days, a senior Justice Department officials told reporters, explaining, “At that point, it will be illegal to have a bump stock–type device. They will be considered a machine gun.” “We expect most owners will comply with the law and follow instructions or hand them in to ATF,"" the official added. ""As with any law, we rely on lawful compliance.” After an October 2017 massacre in Las Vegas in which a gunman fired on a crowd using a bump stock attached to a rifle, President Donald Trump suggested the devices should be prohibited. The Justice Department received more than 186,000 comments on a proposal released this spring, leading to the 157-page final rule released Tuesday. “Specifically, these devices convert an otherwise semiautomatic firearm into a machine gun by functioning as a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism that harnesses the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter,” says the final rule, which hews closely to language proposed in March. “Hence,” it continues, “a semiautomatic firearm to which a bump-stock-type device is attached is able to produce automatic fire with a single pull of the trigger.” That conclusion contradicts the position previously held by both the Obama and Trump administrations, which had deemed the attachments don’t make firearms fully automatic. Officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — a division of the Justice Department known as ATF — previously found that, since pressure must be applied to the gun from behind in addition to pulling the trigger, the devices evade a ban on machine guns under the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act. In a letter dated April 6, 2017, to a bump stock manufacturer, Michael Curtis, chief of the Firearms Technology Industry Services branch of the ATF, said its product was not prohibited. “Since your device does not initiate an automatic firing cycle by a single function of the trigger, FTIB finds it is NOT a machinegun under the NFA, 26 U.S.C. § 5845(b) or the amended GCA, 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(23),” Curtis wrote. The about-face from the Trump administration has led to widespread speculation of a lawsuit that would challenge the new rule by arguing it’s an incorrect reading of the law. “We will be ready to defend not matter who files” a lawsuit, the Justice Department official said Tuesday, adding that the government reached a new interpretation of the older laws, passed when machine guns were made of metal, considering bump stocks are fashioned from plastic. “After the Las Vegas shooting, we took another look.” Still, it remains unclear how the devices have changed since the Trump administration determined in April 2017 that bump stocks could not be banned under existing law. The device has brought intense attention since the mass shooting in Las Vegas last year. In the aftermath of that shooting, even the National Rifle Association said lawmakers should review the devices to see if they “comply with federal law.” Dominic Holden is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom dismissed a suit brought by 15 students against the school district, the sheriff's office, school deputy Scot Peterson, and campus monitor Andrew Medina. Bloom held that because the students were not in custody — prison, for example — state agencies have no legal obligation to protect them. ""The claim arises from the actions of [shooter Nikolas] Cruz, a third party, and not a state actor,"" Bloom wrote in her ruling. ""Thus, the critical question the Court analyzes is whether defendants had a constitutional duty to protect plaintiffs from the actions of Cruz,"" she said, concluding that ""for such a duty to exist on the part of defendants, plaintiffs would have to be considered to be in custody."" Bloom's ruling is in line with the Supreme Court's 7-2 decision in Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales (2005), which held police do not have a constitutional duty to protect people from harm. In that case, SCOTUS determined the obligation does not exist even when police have been repeatedly notified of violation of a restraining order which is supposed to trigger a mandatory arrest.

237,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/trump-bump-stocks-ban.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Charlie Savage WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday issued a new rule banning bump stocks, the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts and that a gunman used to massacre 58 people and wound hundreds of others at a Las Vegas concert in October 2017. The new regulation, which had been expected, would ban the sale or possession of the devices under a new interpretation of existing law. Americans who own bump stocks would have 90 days to destroy their devices or to turn them in to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Justice Department said A.T.F. would post destruction instructions on its website. Bump stocks work by harnessing a firearm’s recoil energy to slide it back and forth to bump against a squeezed trigger, so that it keeps firing without any need for the shooter to pull the trigger again. The Justice Department said that this function transforms semiautomatic weapons, like assault rifles styled on the AR-15, into fully automatic machine guns, which Congress sharply restricted in 1986 — allowing the ban. “With limited exceptions, the Gun Control Act, as amended, makes it unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine-gun unless it was lawfully possessed prior to the effective date of the statute,” the new regulation states. “The bump-stock-type devices covered by this final rule were not in existence prior to the effective date of the statute, and therefore will be prohibited when this rule becomes effective.” [Read the final rule.] A senior Justice Department official, briefing reporters about the new rule on condition of anonymity, said that it was believed that tens of thousands of bump-stock devices are in circulation, but that more exact figures are unavailable. The official said the department expected that most owners of the devices would comply with the new regulation, and that A.T.F. would investigate and take legal action against those who violate it. After publishing a proposed version of the rule earlier this year, the government received 119,264 comments in support of it and 66,182 expressing opposition to it, the Justice Department said. The regulatory move may face a legal challenge. The Justice Department had initially decided that the executive branch lacked the authority to ban bump stocks on its own under existing gun-control laws, and that action in Congress — where it is politically difficult to enact new gun-control legislation — would be necessary to curb legal access to the devices. [Read our explainer on bump stocks.] But the department reinterpreted its legal authority and determined it could ban the devices as an executive action after President Trump directed it to find a way to prohibit them earlier this year, following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. (The shooter in that massacre, who killed 17 people and wounded 17 others, did not use a bump stock.) The National Rifle Association, the gun-rights lobby, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the new rule or its intentions. In the immediate aftermath of the Las Vegas massacre, the N.R.A. supported an A.T.F. review of bump stock devices, seemingly breaking with its usual practice of fiercely opposing any new restrictions on legal access to firearms. At the time, it said it “believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” But the N.R.A. never embraced a ban, and the association’s chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, later bragged in an interview with a gun enthusiast that the organization’s actions had succeeded in slowing down momentum for legislative reform. As the Las Vegas massacre — the worst mass-shooting in modern American history — was replaced by other news, a push for legislation in Congress faltered.

On Tuesday morning, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker signed the new legislation, which will go into effect 90 days after it is added to the Federal Register, which is expected to happen on Friday. The bump-stock ban language will be added to an existing federal law that bans machine guns. The last time time the federal government tried to ban bump stocks was back in 2010, during the Obama administration. At the time, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) agreed that the language in the proposed ban wouldn't hold up Constitutionally, saying that ""bump stocks"" couldn't be regulated unless -- and until -- Congress either changed existing gun laws, or wrote new ones. The new ban, says an unnamed official speaking on condition of anonymity, has passed regulatory muster and, allegedly, the Justice Department and the ATF are both fully prepared to counter any challenges against the ban. Once the ban goes into effect, gun owners who already own bump stocks will have 90 days -- likely until March 2019 -- to surrender them.The Trump administration is officially banning gun ""bump stocks,"" senior officials tell CNN.

Investigators expect most owners will comply with the new rule and ATF will take action against those who don’t, the official said. But there’s no surefire way to know whether owners are complying. The official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.   White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Donald Trump was “once again fulfilling a promise he made to the American people.” Trump had promised the ban in March, saying the devices “turn legal weapons into illegal machines.” Shortly afterward, the Justice Department started the process of amending firearms regulations to define bump stocks as machine guns. ATF received about 186,000 comments on the proposal. The amended regulations reverse a 2010 ATF decision that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress changed existing firearms law or passed a new one. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, some members of Congress sought to ban bump stocks, but no legislation was passed. At least 10 states have sought their own restrictions.   The amended rule was met almost immediately with resistance from gun rights advocates, including Gun Owners of America, which said it would file a lawsuit against the Justice Department and ATF to protect gun owners from “unconstitutional regulations.” “These regulations implicate Second Amendment rights, and courts should be highly suspect when an agency changes its ‘interpretation’ of a statute in order to impair the exercise of enumerated constitutional rights,” the organization’s executive director, Erich Pratt, said. The Justice Department official said the government will fight any legal challenge that may be brought The National Rifle Association called on the Justice Department to provide amnesty for gun owners who already have bump stocks.   “We are disappointed that this final rule fails to address the thousands of law-abiding Americans who relied on prior ATF determinations when lawfully acquiring these devices,” said spokeswoman Jennifer Baker. Police said the gunman in the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock, fired for more than 10 minutes using multiple weapons outfitted with target scopes and bump stocks. Paddock fatally shot himself after the shooting. There were 23 assault-style weapons, including 14 fitted with rapid-fire “bump stock” devices, strewn about his 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel. The largest manufacturer of bump stocks, Slide Fire Solutions, announced in April that it would stop taking orders and shut down its website. The remaining stock of the devices is now being sold by another company, RW Arms, based in Fort Worth, Texas.   ___ Associated Press writer Lisa Marie Pane in Boise, Idaho, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Michael Balsamo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/MikeBalsamo1 .  ©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC  Stay up to date with everything Boston.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. President Trump is calling for a ban on bump stocks. Twelve bump stocks were found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas massacre shooter. Lawmakers, including some Republicans, are concerned about their capabilities. But what are they? The Trump administration on Tuesday took first steps to ban the sale of bump stocks on semi-automatic weapons and has made them illegal to possess beginning in late March. Bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms, have come under increasing scrutiny after they were used in October 2017 when a man opened fire from his Las Vegas hotel suite into a crowd at a country music concert below, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. “Following the mass shooting in Las Vegas, ATF received correspondence from members of the United States Congress, as well as nongovernmental organizations, requesting that ATF examine its past classifications and determine whether bump-stock type devices available on the market constitute machineguns under the statutory definition,” the regulation, which was signed by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker on Tuesday morning, noted. It continued: “The Department decided to move forward with the rulemaking process to clarify the meaning of these terms, which are used in the NFA's  (National Firearms Act) statutory definition of ‘machinegun.’” The regulation will go into effect 90 days after it is formally published in the Federal Register, which is expected to happen on Friday, a Justice Department official said. People who own bump stocks will be required to either surrender them to the ATF or destroy them by late March, the official said. The change has undergone a legal review and the Justice Department and ATF are ready to fight any legal challenge that may be brought, the official added. In March, President Donald Trump said his administration would ""ban"" the devices, which he said ""turn legal weapons into illegal machines."" Shortly after the president's comments, the Justice Department announced that it had started the process to amend federal firearms regulations to define bump stocks as machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sought public comment on the proposal, drawing more than 35,000 comments. The amended regulations reverse a 2010 ATF decision that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress changed existing firearms law or passed a new one. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, there was a growing push by some members of Congress to ban bump stocks, but no legislation was passed. At least 10 states have sought their own restrictions on the devices.

244,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/588073666/0/phoenix/nation~Justice-Department-bans-rapidfire-devices-used-in-worst-modern-mass-shooting/,"The Trump administration on Tuesday imposed a ban on bump stocks, the rapid-fire attachment used to carry out the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Now comes a bigger challenge: How to deal with more than a half-million bump stocks Americans have purchased over the past eight years alone. Justice Department officials, who issued the ban Tuesday, said owners of the cheap plastic accessories that can make off-the-shelf semiautomatic rifles fire almost as rapidly as a machine gun will have 90 days to either turn them over to federal agents or to melt, shred or crush them. Those who don't face the threat of criminal penalties. Both gun owners and advocates of tougher restrictions questioned its effectiveness. Because officials had long taken the view that the stocks weren't covered by federal gun laws, their sales weren't tracked and the government has no way to determine who owns one. Some states and cities acted more swiftly to ban the devices on their own, but they've had little success getting people to surrender them. In Massachusetts, the first state to impose a ban, only a handful of the devices have been surrendered to state police. In Denver, where a citywide ban passed in January carrying a fine and jail time, police reported zero surrenders. “Compliance will be impossible because there’s no registration,"" said Mark Pennak, president of the gun rights group Maryland Shall Issue. “And based on how the state bans have been received, I doubt there will be any compliance. It will be haphazard and discriminatory."" Bump stocks had been under scrutiny since a gunman killed 58 people and injured more than 800 from his perch in a Las Vegas casino in 2017, the deadliest mass shooting in recent memory. The devices allowed the gunman, Stephen Paddock, to fire more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition in 10 minutes. Bump stocks were affixed to half of Paddock's guns. The Justice Department had long taken the view that bump stocks fell outside federal laws banning machine guns. It reversed that position Tuesday after months of pressure from President Donald Trump and others in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting. ""As written, this case has important implications for gun owners since, in the coming days, an estimated half a million bump stock owners will have the difficult decision of either destroying or surrendering their valuable property, or else risk felony prosecution,"" said Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America. He said the group planned to challenge the ban in court. Another gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, filed a lawsuit Tuesday to block the rule in federal court in Washington. The national ban comes with no ""grandfather"" clause to allow previously produced devices and doesn't provide any financial reimbursement or tax credit. The main manufacturer of one brand in Texas stopped producing the device over the summer in anticipation of the ban. Another Texas company purchased that producer's inventory and was still selling devices for $199 Tuesday, including within a Christmas promotion guaranteeing delivery if ordered by Thursday.  More: A year after Vegas shooting, ATF emails reveal blame, alarm over bump stocks More: President Trump vows bump stocks will be 'gone' in a matter of weeks  Bump stocks combined two legal devices, a plastic stock and a firearm, that together function like a machine gun. The bump stock harnesses the recoil of the rifle to accelerate trigger pulls, technically “bumping” the trigger for each shot after it bounces off the shooter’s shoulder. After the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017, the Justice Department reconsidered its determination that the device was legal. In 2003, 2010, 2012 and 2013, the department ruled the $200 devices were legal. More: Hundreds of gun add-ons test limits of ATF review “Consistent with its authority to ‘reconsider and rectify’ potential classification errors &mldr ATF reviewed its earlier determinations for bump-stock-type devices issued between 2008 and 2017 and concluded that those determinations did not include extensive legal analysis of the statutory term ‘automatically’ or ‘single function of the trigger,’ "" the Justice Department wrote. The move was widely expected. Trump announced at the one-year anniversary of the Las Vegas shooting that “we’re knocking out bump stocks."" Internal emails show officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the agency that regulates guns, struggled with how to block a product its staff had long concluded was legal. The Trump administration concluded that a regulatory rule was simpler than negotiating with Congress to rewrite gun laws. Kris Brown, president of the Brady Campaign, a group that favors stricter gun laws, applauded the change but said she fears it could be vulnerable to legal challenges. “The only way to ensure that bump stocks and similar devices are properly regulated is for Congress to take action,” she said. ""We will continue to call on congressional leaders to do just that."" Eleven states – California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – have banned bump stocks. More than a dozen cities and other states are considering bans.    ",2018-12-18 11:55:26,Justice Department bans rapid-fire devices used in worst modern mass shooting,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com
245,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/12/18/justice-department-will-ban-bump-stocks/,"Trending: By Devlin Barrett | Washington Post WASHINGTON – The Trump administration will ban bump-stock devices like the kind used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, a decision that is scheduled to go into effect in three months but could face legal challenges from gun rights groups or manufacturers. Justice Department officials said Tuesday that a weapon modified with a bump stock – a type of device that attaches to the butt of a rifle and uses the energy of the gun’s recoil to automatically fire another round – will be classified as a machine gun, meaning that only law enforcement agencies can use them. As a result, once the new regulations are published by the government on Friday, owners of the devices will have 90 days to destroy them or turn them into the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. After the Las Vegas shooting, in which 58 people were killed by a gunman who used rifles with bump stocks to fire down on a crowded outdoor music concert, gun-control advocates began pushing for ATF to reexamine regulations so it could declare bump stocks illegal, because they turn semiautomatic weapons into fully automatic ones. Justice Department officials said they will publish in the public register in coming days their finding that bump-stock-type weapons are machine guns, “because such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.” The move, which had been expected, could lead to lawsuits from gun rights groups or gun manufacturers. RW Arms, a company that sells bump stocks, did not respond to messages seeking comment, nor did the National Rifle Association. The gun rights group has previously urged the government to interpret regulations to restrict bump stocks, rather than seeking a law to ban them. In 2010, ATF decided it could not regulate bump stocks; officials said the devices did not meet the definition of a machine gun, because they did not permanently alter a gun’s trigger mechanism. The Trump administration began reexamining its regulations on bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting, but that effort got a renewed push in April after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, though that attack did not involve bump stock weapons. The bump-stock announcement came the same day the Trump administration released a report on school safety from a commission formed after 17 students and teachers were killed in the Parkland shooting. The commission’s report advised against imposing age restrictions for purchasing firearms and suggested that states adopt laws aimed at keeping guns from “individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others.” The Las Vegas attack stands as the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, but it is the only major attack in which the gunman used a bump stock. Law enforcement officials have worried since Las Vegas that its use in that attack could spawn copycat killers. A 1986 law bans the sale of machine guns manufactured after that year and restricts the sale of such guns made before that year. Because bump stocks were created after 1986, the regulatory change amounts to an effective ban on the devices. Law enforcement agencies are unlikely to use bump-stock weapons, because they are difficult to fire accurately. The Washington Post’s Mark Berman contributed to this report.

          / CBS News President Trump was ambiguous Tuesday about the chances of a government shutdown, declaring it ""too early"" to tell if a significant chunk of the federal government will close just three days shy of the funding deadline. ""We'll see what happens,"" the president told reporters Tuesday at a roundtable on school safety. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill he's sure Washington will avoid a shutdown, as Mr. Trump demands funding for his border wall and Democrats say they won't give it to him. Mr. Trump made the comments in response to reporters' questions during a roundtable discussion with family members of victims of the Parkland shooting and law enforcement officials. The group was there to discuss a Federal Commission on School Safety report that yielded more than 90 recommendations. The White House meeting came the same day the Justice Department announced it is finalizing a rule banning bump stocks, the device used in the Las Vegas shooting. Democrats claim the president has not done nearly enough on gun violence to help prevent another mass shooting. Stand with Parkland responded to the school safety report, lauding the administration for its efforts, and urging it to follow through with the recommendations. ""This administration has a responsibility to address this issue and we look forward to working with you in the near future,"" Stand with Parkland said in a lengthy response. ""The safety of our nation's students and staff members at school is an issue that must addressed in a bi-partisan manner because it benefits all Americans."" But the focus in Washington is the looming shutdown deadline. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a relatively rare press briefing Tuesday that the White House is looking for other possible ways to get the president $5 billion for the border wall, using existing federal funds. Agencies are currently reviewing how that might be feasible, she said. Sanders said the president will take a look at what the Senate passes and decide whether to sign it. But Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested they don't really know where the president stands. On Monday night, Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said, ""if the White House has a plan they are keeping it to themselves."" If Congress doesn't reach an agreement that Mr. Trump signs, more than 400,000 federal employees will have to work without pay and an additional 380,000 will be furloughed without pay, according to a report from Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Two-year-old Abdullah Hassan, a US citizen like his father, suffers from a rare genetic brain condition and is on life support in a hospital in Oakland, California.  But his mother, Shaima Swileh, was unable to join him because of Donald Trump’s order barring most citizens from six countries, including Yemen. After a tearful televised plea from the boy’s father, the US embassy in Cairo issued a visa for Swileh, who has been staying in Egypt as she tries to fly to the United States. She will arrive in San Francisco late on Wednesday, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Muslim civil rights group that assisted the family. “This is the happiest day of my life,” her husband, Ali Hassan, said in a statement. “This will allow us to mourn with dignity.” Hassan said he had been ready to take his son off life support last week after doctors said the case was terminal, with his wife only receiving automated replies when inquiring with US authorities on her visa application. The Council on American-Islamic Relations launched a campaign that it said prompted 15,000 emails to elected officials as well as thousands of tweets. Abdullah’s grandfather earlier told the San Francisco Chronicle that Swileh was crying every day as she wanted to see her son “one last time”. “To hold him for at least a minute. She’s not going to see him forever,” he said. Until the media attention, the family said it kept receiving automated responses from US authorities that their case was being processed. Representative Barbara Lee, a Democrat who represents Oakland, took up the case and said it showed how Trump’s travel ban was “inhumane and un-American”. “As a member of Congress, and a mother myself, the cruelty of barring a mother from reuniting with a sick child takes my breath away,” she tweeted late on Monday. Trump vowed during the 2016 campaign to ban all Muslims from entering the United States, despite constitutional protections of freedom of religion, after a mass shooting in California by a couple of Pakistani descent. She voiced relief at the waiver but added: “So many families are still torn apart by the heinous travel ban.” “We can’t stop until we end this un-American policy for good,” she wrote on Twitter. A state department spokesman, Robert Palladino, voiced sympathy for the family in the “very sad case”. But he said that visas are “decided on a case-by-case basis” in accordance with US laws. The state department is “ensuring the integrity and security of our country’s borders and at the same time making every effort to facilitate legitimate travel to the United States”, he told reporters. “These are not easy questions.” But such exceptions to Trump’s ban are exceedingly rare. The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes Trump’s order, said that only 2% of applicants have been granted waivers. In an executive order that triggered chaos before court challenges and revisions, Trump blocked new visas to nearly all citizens of five Muslim-majority countries – Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen – as well as North Korea. A divided supreme court in June upheld the ban, which it said was within the president’s powers.",2018-12-18 14:35:32,Yemeni mother kept from seeing dying son by travel ban is granted US visa,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

        Dominic Holden Posted on December 18, 2018, at 6:00 p.m. ET A bump stock device that fits on a semi-automatic rifle to increase the firing speed. The Trump administration's ban on bump stocks amounts to an illegal “about-face” that “smacks of agency abuse,” according to a lawsuit filed by gun rights activists on Tuesday, hours after officials released a final rule to prohibit the devices, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns. Legal challenges have been widely expected since officials indicated a new regulation was forthcoming in the aftermath of the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, where a bump stock was used and 58 people were killed. Given that both the Obama and Trump administrations found that the devices cannot be prohibited under federal law, a sudden policy reversal appeared particularly vulnerable to a court battle. The suit from three gun rights groups on Tuesday points out that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — a division of the Justice Department known as ATF — has repeatedly found that the devices cannot be banned by the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act. “ATF’s Final Rule is the product of serious, multi-dimensional legal violations rendering the process and the rule invalid,” says the complaint in US District Court in Washington, DC, which alleges violations of both federal law and constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs say the ban also circumvents authority that belongs to Congress, while skirting requirements for new regulations, and that it was approved by an illegitimate acting attorney general, rendering the rule invalid. (Despite bipartisan talk in Congress about banning bump stocks after the Vegas shooting, that legislation has stalled.) A judge should block the rule before it takes effect in 90 days, the complaint argues. Just hours before the lawsuit was filed, Justice Department officials released the 157-page regulation that would require destroying tens of thousands of the devices currently in circulation. “We will be ready to defend no matter who files [a lawsuit],” a Justice Department official told reporters Tuesday. The final rule declares “these devices convert an otherwise semiautomatic firearm into a machine gun by functioning as a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism that harnesses the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter.” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders added that people “in possession of bump-stock-type devices must turn those devices to an ATF field office or destroy them by March 21st.” In a swift response, three gun rights advocacy organizations — the Firearms Policy Coalition, Firearms Policy Foundation, and Madison Society Foundation — joined with Damien Guedes, a Pennsylvania man who bought a bump stock in 2014, to “prevent ATF from enforcing this new rule.” “ATF’s abrupt about-face on this issue in promulgating and implementing the Final Rule to criminalize that which it had for years expressly deemed legal under the law of Congress inherently smacks of agency abuse or dereliction of duty in following the law,” the complaint says. The suit alleges that acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker — who is sued in his “purported capacity,” according to the complaint — lacks authority to oversee the new rule because he should never have been appointed. There have been questions about the legality of Whitaker’s appointment since he took over. (A federal law says that after an attorney general departs, the deputy attorney general assumes the acting role — in this case, Rod Rosenstein — although the Justice Department has argued that another law allows the president to name an acting attorney general himself, as long as that person is sufficiently high-ranking and has been there longer than three months.) Since Whitaker shouldn’t be in the post, the complaint contends, the bump stock rule “must be struck down as invalidly enacted.” The complaint goes on to allege violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, which mandates standards for creating regulations. The Justice Department didn’t turn over documents under open-record laws, while appearing to cut short a public comment by five days by posting “comment period closed” on a web page for comments, the complaint alleges. The complaint also says the rule denies bump stock owners their Fifth Amendment rights under the Takings Clause, which says property cannot be seized without financial compensation and that such bans cannot be applied retroactively. On a more mechanical level, the plaintiffs insist a bump stock simply isn’t a machine gun, citing the ATF’s past statements. “Experts opining on behalf of ATF have consistently concluded that commonly used bump-stock-type devices manufactured by Slide Fire and Bump Fire Systems do not function so as to convert the associated firearm into a ‘machinegun’ because, in fact, the shooter must still separately pull the trigger to fire each successive shot,” the court filing says. Even if bump stocks did produce a machine-gun effect, it continues, the rule is too sweeping because it could be applied to any device or technique with that effect — “such as through certain fashioning of rubber bands or belt loops, or by simply training one’s trigger finger to fire more rapidly.” As BuzzFeed News reported in March, the Trump administration asserted in 2017 that bump stocks must be allowed. In a letter dated April 6, 2017, to a bump stock manufacturer, ATF said the product was not prohibited. “Since your device does not initiate an automatic firing cycle by a single function of the trigger, FTIB finds it is NOT a machinegun.” Trump sought to change the legal status of bump stocks after political pressure grew in the aftermath of the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas. Even the National Rifle Association said at the time that lawmakers should review the devices to see if they “comply with federal law.” A spokesperson for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News’s request for comment about the allegations in the lawsuit.

          / CBS/AP A federal judge has ruled that schools and sheriff's officials in Broward County, Florida, had no constitutional duty to protect students during the Feb. 14 shooting massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead and wounded 17 others, reports the Sun-Sentinel. U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom dismissed a suit filed by 15 students against six defendants, including the Broward school district, the county sheriff's office and Scot Peterson, the embattled deputy who failed to confront gunman Nikolas Cruz as shots rang out. The lawsuit accused the defendants of violating the students' rights under the 14th Amendment, which disallows deprivation of life, liberty and property without due process. Bloom, however, ruled the students would have to be considered in custody for officials to be constitutionally required to protect them from Cruz. The lawsuit said Peterson's ""arbitrary and conscience-shocking actions and inactions directly and predictably caused children to die, get injured, and get traumatized,"" arguing that sheriff's and school officials ""either have a policy that allows killers to walk through a school killing people without being stopped"" or ""have such inadequate training that the individuals tasked with carrying out the policies ... lack the basic fundamental understandings of what those policies are such that they are incapable of carrying them out."" The lawsuit claimed Superintendent of Broward County Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie and Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel were well aware of the potential danger the shooter posed and a lack of security at the school but ""chose not to fix it,"" reported CBS affiliate WPEC. ""We didn't deserve that. We were just students and we thought we were safe at school and we didn't need that to happen to us,"" former student Audrey Diaz told the station in January following the filing of the suit. Bloom ruled the 14th Amendment generally provides due process protection from state actors, not third parties. ""The claim arises from the actions of Cruz, a third party, and not a state actor,"" Bloom wrote in a Dec. 12 ruling. ""Thus, the critical question the Court analyzes is whether defendants had a constitutional duty to protect plaintiffs from the actions of Cruz. As previously stated, for such a duty to exist on the part of defendants, plaintiffs would have to be considered to be in custody."" The ruling comes a week after Broward Circuit Judge Patti Englander Henning last week, who rejected Peterson's claim that he had ""no legal duty to protect students and faculty"" when she refused to dismiss a negligence lawsuit filed by Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed in the attack. Henning found Peterson had an ""obligation to act reasonably"" in his capacity as an officer at the school during the shooting. Pollack said it made no sense for Peterson's attorneys to argue a sworn law enforcement officer with a badge and a gun had no requirement to go inside. ""Then what is he doing there?"" Pollack said after the ruling. ""He had a duty. I'm not going to let this go. My daughter, her death is not going to be in vain."" Peterson's attorney, Michael Piper, said he understands people might be offended or outraged at his client's defense, but he argued that as a matter of law, the deputy had no duty to confront the shooter. Peterson did not attend the hearing. ""There is no legal duty that can be found,"" Piper said. ""At its very worst, Scot Peterson is accused of being a coward. That does not equate to bad faith."" Piper has said he would appeal the ruling. Cruz has pleaded not guilty, but his lawyers have said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

252,https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianmitchell/2018/12/18/24-year-old-filmmaker-tevin-tavares-is-following-in-ryan-cooglers-footsteps/,"24-Year-Old filmmaker Tevin Tavares The city of Oakland has a storied history of igniting social movements, fearlessly led by gifted creators who both understand and embrace the responsibility of having a platform capable of influencing the masses. Seeing the success of brilliant Bay Area filmmakers like Ryan Coogler, the director behind record-breaking box office hits like Black Panther and the Creed franchise, one emerging Bay Area storyteller is poised to follow in his footsteps, extending the legacy of multimedia creators intent on shifting the paradigm and introducing progressive ideas. After watching a compelling commercial chronicling the journey of LeBron James and the road to achieving his first title in Cleveland, 24-year-old Tevin Tavares was inspired to tell impactful stories. Tavares first earned notoriety for producing an original video for Kendrick Lamar’s LUST, which appears on the rapper’s Pulitzer Prize winning album DAMN. Within a short period, the short film went viral, landing on media outlets like Complex, XXL, Pigeons and Planes and 2 Dope Boyz. The video generated such a response that most outlets perceived the film to be Lamar's official music video for the song. In 2015, Tavares and his team followed up Lust with a short two-minute film entitled The Shoes, an in-depth expose' of the complex issues plaguing sneaker culture, which also drew critical acclaim and widely circulated the web. Cementing a distinct style and approach, he quickly teamed up with friends Sutton Raphael and Carlyle Garrick to launch Combined Culture in 2016, a multimedia production company focused on producing cross-platform concepts for global brands and media companies alike. Leveraging this newfound momentum, Tavares left a promising position climbing the corporate ladder with the Golden State Warriors and took a leap of faith and moved to Portland, Oregon with ambitious aspirations to create content for Adidas. Working around the clock to solidify his position, Tavares would proceed to make his mark. While in his role with the brand, he seized the opportunity to collaborate on a slate of national campaigns and product launches, developing a sharper outlook on his intended goal and adopting key skills to further propel his storytelling abilities. Since placing the bet on himself and stepping into the industry, Tavares has paved an impressive path independently. He has notably partnered with leading fashion and lifestyle brands like Nike, Adidas Originals, Jordan Brand and the NBA. His most recent works include directing a short film for NBA standout Jabari Parker, as well as directing a digital feature entitled Destroy Doubt that follows the life of Pittsburgh Steelers star receiver Antonio Brown. Setting his sights toward the future, Tavares looks to take the proven template he's established and apply it to producing powerful films that drive important conversations forward. I spoke with Tevin about his come up story, mastering the craft and his bigger vision for telling impactful stories across screens. Mitchell: What was the defining moment or spark that inspired you to step into filmmaking? Tevin Tavares: LeBron James had just won his first championship with the Miami Heat and Nike ran a commercial called The Ringmaker. The spot showed the process of a ring maker watching LeBron along his journey from being drafted to holding the trophy. They had Marvin Gaye’s song I Want You playing in the background. It impacted me in a real way, because it showed LeBron repeatedly going through different types of adversity — From losing, battling and finally getting that championship ring. The reason why the Marvin Gaye song touched me, nearly to the point of tears, is because that was my grandfather’s favorite artist. My dad always had a poster of the I Want You album in the house and he would play it all the time.  When I was watching LeBron’s journey, I compared it to my own. I went to a junior college out of high school, while all of my friends went to four-year schools. I broke my hand my senior year, which stopped me from receiving a football scholarship. It seemed to end my football dreams. But, as I’m seeing LeBron endure this extremely challenging process to win his first ring, it gave me so much inspiration. That’s the moment I truly realized how commercials can make you feel. I realized the power of storytelling. I realized the power of representation and seeing people experiencing the same struggles as you, while sharing the same aspirations to be greater. After seeing that commercial, I knew what I wanted to do — I wanted to create commercials for Nike. Mitchell: After coming to this realization, what immediate steps did you take to start bringing your vision to life? Tevin Tavares: I knew that the only way I was going to be able to do that was by moving to Oregon. If I’m going to produce commercials for Nike, I have to be where they are. At the time, I had an internship with the Golden State Warriors in their Marketing department.  I was hanging shirts on seats, handing out Jack In The Box coupons and hustling to establish myself. While I was working the internship, I received scholarships to go to the University of Oregon. I networked with a bunch of people from Nike. Finally, I received an internship at Nike my junior year of college, and that’s when everything changed. Right before starting my internship with Nike, my friend Carlyle came to me and explained how advertising doesn’t capture that feeling anymore — they don’t tell real stories that evoke real emotion. He had an idea to create a film and release it. He wrote a poem called The Shoes, which told the story of a young man being robbed and shot for his Jordan sneakers. Growing up in the Bay Area, we’ve seen this reality play out many times. So, I met him the next day with my friends Sutton and Jose to make this short film. I played the lead role, portraying a kid who worked hard to be responsible and earn his own money before being shot and killed. After watching the final edit, I lost my mind, because I saw myself acting out this real story and bringing out the raw and honest emotion in it. We had to fly out to New York for an advertising trip, and by the time I got off the plane, the short film had spread everywhere. Thousands of people across the country watched something that we made in a matter of hours.  That’s when I hit me that this combination of filmmaking, writing and acting gave me the ability to directly impact people across the world all within a two-minute video. Mitchell: Describe the evolution from directing and releasing your first film to producing your first projects for brands like Nike and Adidas? Tevin Tavares: After that film, Life of Pablo had just came out, so we decided to make a spec commercial film for Kanye. I brought together a group of like-minded people from different states who were individually skilled and all loved Kanye’s music. We had a room filled with 20 college-aged kids from across the country, reflecting every race and walk of life. We created the false campaign for Kanye called Dream Create Conquer, aimed at inspiring kids to do all three.  If you have a dream — create it, conquer it and move on to the next. After putting the short film out, it went viral again. I told my instructor that if I shot this right, I would end up getting a job at Adidas. Funny enough, the film was featured on Nice Kicks and attracted the attention of top executives at Adidas. Sure enough, before graduation, I landed a job with Adidas Originals. It felt like the best story of my life. I was creating content I believed in, working at the companies I always dreamed about and was in position to do more.  Ironically, once I graduated and started at Adidas, everything started falling apart. I thought I was the man walking in, thinking I was going to just create cool videos and campaigns every day. Instead, it was a sobering reality check, because they had me doing a lot of administrative work that only reminded me why I didn’t feel like a fit in the corporate world. I learned a lot at Adidas and connected with a lot of people. But, the day eventually came when they let me go from the brand. Mitchell: How has your process and experiences shaped how you define success and  what a 'Dream Job' really looks like? Tevin Tavares: Those experiences taught me the important of putting the people and culture first. A lot of times we think corporate puts the culture or black people first, not to disrespect any brands, but that’s not their first priority. I would be in meetings and see young black faces getting exploited. I’ll be in a room working on a campaign driven by black people with a majority of white people in the room making the decisions. That’s where it hit me that my position as the owner in control of telling the stories was crucial. Working in-house at brands was cool, but that corporate system wasn’t where I would be most effective or reach my potential, because I care too much about the culture. I believed that I could do on a high level on my own in another lane. I’m not at all trying to bash big companies, but I don’t think their structure and approach aligns with mine. At times, I was too passionate about things that they simply didn’t align with or share the same passion for. There’s nothing wrong with that, but its not an environment I want to move forward in. Mitchell: You were nominated for a College Emmy for your work -- Describe the process of creating that film and what inspired it? Tevin Tavares: After Nike, I started an internship at Jordan Brand. It seemed to provide everything I wanted. It was a global company, I was stepping foot on the Nike campus every day, I was walking past all of the iconic sneakers, and I was interacting with Nike executives regularly. But, one day I hit a turning point. I was watching a Dame Dash interview in which he was speaking about becoming your own boss. It made me think about the many moments at Nike where I thought maybe the corporate life wasn’t for me. That moment gave me the spark to start my own agency.  I called it Combined Culture, because being from the Bay Area, all we do is combine cultures. When I came back my senior year, Nike didn’t offer me a full-time job, so I starting thinking about my next move. One day, while sitting with five of my friends, we were watching the news and saw that not too far outside of Eugene, there was a community college shooting. The mass shooting was all over major news outlets. After seeing how devastating it was, we collectively decided to do something about it. When mass shootings happen, they always tell the story about the kids who were shot, but never the people who witnessed it. So, the five of us created a film to tell the other side of the story. I wrote, directed and played the lead role in it. We told the story of a kid who barely escapes a mass shooting and the different stages of the experience through his perspective. It was one of the most rewarding experiences I ever had with my team. The film spread again, across local and national news outlets. We were invited to schools to speak about the film, what to do when mass shootings happen and ways to be protected. A few months after it released, we were nominated for a College Emmy and saw our work competing against people from all over the country. That experience really kicked off Combined Culture and gave me the direction for where I wanted to take the company and my craft. Mitchell: What would you describe as the formula to tell stories that have such an important impact and how do you define success with these projects? Tevin Tavares: I look at it through a Ryan Coogler lens, wherein I always put my own Bay Area cultural twist on any film I produce. It’s the same thing with Combined Culture. If you look at the story we told — we told the story of a young man with Cerebral Palsy and a young man with ALS. If you look at any ESPN story highlighting anyone with a disability, it’s often very sad in tone. We want to flip the sadness into motivation and encouragement. Although it’s a very serious and sad topic, we still wanted to make sure it feels Hip Hop and modern; something people can connect with culturally and develop a better understanding.  That’s success, making it relatable to people in a way that they can feel it, but also see themselves within the storyline. We find a way to mix these different elements that wouldn’t commonly blend well together. When you merge cultures together, it’s the same thing. You’re taking aspects that may appear very separate or specific to certain groups, but you find the commonalities that make them relatable. When I look at success, I look at how people feel. If people tell me that they legitimately cried after watching one of my films, that’s success to me. They feel so emotionally impacted after experiencing the work that they have to step out and take action to make a difference in real life. It also means they’re going to share the story, which means there will be one more person made aware and impacted enough to help save a life. I don’t want people to look at these stories and feel sorry for them. Instead,  I want them to feel strong and inspired to help them and those in the same position. Mitchell: How would you define your philosophy or the guiding principles that fuel your work? Tevin Tavares:  My main mission in this world is to inspire through my creativity. Since I was 18, I’ve loved telling stories and using my platform to share my perspective. I realized that is was through my creativity and storytelling that I got my point across or effectively shared my perspective with a broader audience. That’s one thing that I wake up every morning and aspire to do. How do I use my creativity to reach the next level? How am I going to use my creativity to achieve my goals? How am I using my creativity to help my family, my friends and my community? How am I going to elevate my life through creativity.

Spokeswoman Jennifer Baker says the Justice Department should provide amnesty for gun owners who already have the devices. The Justice Department says the attachments will be banned beginning in late March under a law that prohibits machine guns. The new rule reverses a 2010 government decision that found bump stocks didn’t amount to machine guns. Baker says the regulation “fails to address the thousands of law-abiding Americans” who followed the government’s previous guidance.

254,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-administration-bans-bump-stocks-device-used-las-vegas-shooting-n949581?cid=public-rss_20181218," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News The Justice Department on Tuesday issued its final rule banning bump stocks — a device that was prominently used in the Las Vegas shooting massacre last year, which allows a semi-automatic rifle to work like a machine gun. Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker announced the rule in a statement Tuesday. ""We are faithfully following President Trump’s leadership by making clear that bump stocks, which turn semiautomatics into machine guns, are illegal, and we will continue to take illegal guns off of our streets,"" Whitaker said. Later, at a school safety event at the White House, he called it a ""big victory"" for Trump's administration. Trump had urged the federal government to ban bump stocks this past spring following a deadly Valentine's Day shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead. However, the device gained notoriety when a lone gunman killed 59 people and injured at least 527 others attending a country music festival in Las Vegas in October 2017. The shooter, Stephen Paddock, had 22 semi-automatic rifles and 14 of them were equipped with bump stocks. They allowed him to fire the rifles continuously with a single pull of the trigger, resulting in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. ""We've taken important steps, but much work remains to be done, as always,"" Trump said of his administration's actions on guns and school safety at the White House event. The rule amends the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to include all bump-stock-type devices and re-classify them as machine guns. The move would ban individuals from owning or selling bump stocks, or similarly designed devices. Once the rule becomes effective, anyone owning one would be required to destroy it or turn it over to a local ATF office, the DOJ said. The rule will become final 90 days after it is published in the Federal Register. Whitaker also said on Tuesday at the White House that bump stock owners would have 90 days to destroy their devices or to turn them. The Justice Department said the ATF plans to post instructions on how to properly destroy the device on its website. Matt Deitsch, the co-founder of March for Our Lives, a youth-led movement against gun violence created after the Parkland shooting, said the ban “took far too long,” but that it was a step in the right direction. ""This is a good first step, but it only scratches the surface of the reforms we need to end the epidemic of gun violence in America once and for all. We welcome this new policy, but we cannot allow the current Administration, members of Congress, or the NRA to use this as cover while they stall on reforms that our country and communities need immediately,” Deitsch said. The National Rifle Association, however, said in a statement to NBC News that the rule should have offered ""amnesty"" to current bump stock owners because of a 2010 decision by the ATF that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress amended existing firearms law or passed a new one. “We are disappointed that this final rule fails to address the thousands of law-abiding Americans who relied on prior ATF determinations when lawfully acquiring these devices,” Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman, said. ""As we recommended to ATF in our comments on the proposed rule, Congress made it possible for the Attorney General to provide amnesty for firearms regulated under the National Firearms Act. The Attorney General should have exercised that authority to provide a period of amnesty under this rule.""

255,http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/503046301.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration Tuesday banned bump stocks, the firearm attachments that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns and were used during the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The regulation gives gun owners until late March to turn in or destroy the devices. After that, it will be illegal to possess them under the same federal laws that prohibit machine guns. Bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in October 2017 when a man opened fire from his Las Vegas hotel suite into a crowd at a country music concert, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more. The regulation was signed Tuesday by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. It will take effect 90 days after it is published in the Federal Register, which is expected to happen Friday. Bump stock owners will be required to either destroy them or surrender them to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a senior Justice Department official said. It is impossible to know just how many bump stocks Americans own because the devices aren't traceable, but ATF has estimated that between 280,000 and about 520,000 have been sold since 2010. Investigators expect most owners will comply with the new rule and ATF will take action against those who don't, the official said. But there's no surefire way to know whether owners are complying. The official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Donald Trump was ""once again fulfilling a promise he made to the American people."" Trump had promised the ban in March, saying the devices ""turn legal weapons into illegal machines."" Shortly afterward, the Justice Department started the process of amending firearms regulations to define bump stocks as machine guns. ATF received about 186,000 comments on the proposal. The amended regulations reverse a 2010 ATF decision that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress changed existing firearms law or passed a new one. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, some members of Congress sought to ban bump stocks, but no legislation was passed. At least 10 states have sought their own restrictions. The amended rule was met almost immediately with resistance from gun rights advocates, including Gun Owners of America, which said it would file a lawsuit against the Justice Department and ATF to protect gun owners from ""unconstitutional regulations."" ""These regulations implicate Second Amendment rights, and courts should be highly suspect when an agency changes its 'interpretation' of a statute in order to impair the exercise of enumerated constitutional rights,"" the organization's executive director, Erich Pratt, said. The Justice Department official said the government will fight any legal challenge that may be brought The National Rifle Association called on the Justice Department to provide amnesty for gun owners who already have bump stocks. ""We are disappointed that this final rule fails to address the thousands of law-abiding Americans who relied on prior ATF determinations when lawfully acquiring these devices,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Baker. Police said the gunman in the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock, fired for more than 10 minutes using multiple weapons outfitted with target scopes and bump stocks. Paddock fatally shot himself after the shooting. There were 23 assault-style weapons, including 14 fitted with rapid-fire ""bump stock"" devices, strewn about his 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel. The largest manufacturer of bump stocks, Slide Fire Solutions, announced in April that it would stop taking orders and shut down its website. The remaining stock of the devices is now being sold by another company, RW Arms, based in Fort Worth, Texas. © 2021 StarTribune.

256,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/gKObdiTMNb0/,"President Donald Trump spoke with family members of school shooting victims at the White House on Tuesday about preventing further shootings in the future. “We are profoundly grateful to all of the families who are working with us to help prevent others from suffering the same terrible heartache and tragedy,” Trump said during a roundtable meeting with families and administration officials at the White House.
Carson Abt, a survivor of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, was also present for the discussion. Abt urged state and local governments to take seriously the recommendations in the report, rather than wait for additional shootings to take place. She pointed to the success of new active shooter drills in schools, saying that the skills could help them in other emergency situations such as concert and movie theater venues. “If you know what to do at a young age, it’s going to, unfortunately, be instinct by the time you are older,” she said. “While it is unfortunate, it will keep you safe.” Other family members included Max Schachter, Ryan Petty, and Andy Pollack – three fathers of Parkland High School shooting victims – and JT Lewis and Scarlett Lewis, the brother and mother of a victim from the Sandy Hook shooting. Pollack praised President Trump for forming the task force based on facts, instead of just a narrow focus on gun control. “This is the most comprehensive report done after a school shooting ever by an administration that’s going to affect our quality of life for all students and teachers throughout this country,” he said. Scarlet Lewis showed a picture of her six-year-old son Jesse, who was shot and killed at Sandy Hook after he stood up to the shooter and shouted for his classmates to run. She thanked Trump for including their recommendations for proactive prevention and social-emotional learning in schools. “This is the first administration to do that, and I want to thank you for your courage,” Lewis said. Petty also praised the report for its comprehensive nature. “My hope is that rather than fighting over the things we don’t like or we think we are missing, that as a nation we come forward on the things we agree on,” he said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen vowed that the report would be implemented as soon as possible. “This is a start. This will not sit on a bookshelf,” she said. 2nd AmendmentPoliticsAndy PollackCarson AbtDonald TrumpJesse LewisKirstjen NielsenMass ShootingMax SchachterRyan PettyScarlet LewisStoneman Douglas High School .

House Democrats hold first committee hearing on Capitol riot News By Nolan Hicks Submit December 18, 2018 | 5:07pm				| Updated December 18, 2018 | 5:49pm The Trump administration finally moved Tuesday to officially ban bump stocks — an attachment for semi-automatic weapons that helped to fuel the horrific carnage in the Las Vegas mass shooting last year. The deadly devices would be banned under existing federal law that heavily restricts ownership of fully automatic weapons, arguing they effectively turn semi-automatic weapons into their even-quicker-firing brethren. “With limited exceptions, the Gun Control Act… makes it unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine-gun unless it was lawfully possessed prior to the effective date of the statute,” according to the new rule announced by the White House. “The bump-stock-type devices covered by this final rule were not in existence prior to the effective date of the statute, and therefore will be prohibited.” Owners will have 90 days to turn in their bump stocks or destroy them. The Justice Department said Tuesday that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms will post instructions on its website. The new rule had been expected for months. A senior Justice Department official said the government believes there are tens of thousands of bump stocks in existence but did not have a firmer count. A bump stock fits on the butt of a semi-automatic rifle and essentially uses the gun’s recoil energy to push it forward again after each shot — making it easier for gunmen to fire more bullets, more quickly. Las Vegas gunman Stephan Paddock used the device to help fuel his killing rampage, as he rained down bullets on a country music concert going on across the street from his hotel room — killing 58 in the worst mass shooting in recent American history. Paddock’s motive remains a mystery. Read Next Trump asked cabinet to look for border wall funding Share Selection This story has been shared 169,598 times.

While the movie and video games industry were both featured prominently during the creation of the panel and experts’ major topic of testimony, the panel ultimately had little to say about entertainment’s impact on school violence. Instead, the report narrows in on the easy availability of firearms as a contributing factor in mass shootings. Titled Final Report of the Federal Commission on School Safety, the document is the work of a blue-ribbon panel formed in March 2018. Current members include education secretary Betsy DeVos, acting U.S. attorney general Matthew Whitaker, secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, and secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen. Jeff Sessions was also a member for a time, prior to his resignation in November. The Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) comes out smelling like a rose, despite its connection to the targeted games industry. The Commission notes that the ESRB ratings system is well-known among consumers and succeeds in its goal of keeping mature games out of the hands of children. From the report: According to a 2016 survey, 86 percent of parents with children who play video games know about the ESRB’s rating system, and 73 percent say they check a computer or video game’s rating before buying it for their children. The ESRB rating system has gained high levels of trust among parents, who regularly report being satisfied with the level of information as they choose which games to select for children. Rather than impose restrictions on video games, the Commission instead told schools they needed to do a better job controlling access to the internet as a whole. Among its recommendations are to “ensure adequate internet safety measures” and “partner with parents [in order to] strengthen internet safety measures at schools.” “While some self-regulators provide easy-to-understand rating systems and effectively restrict content through retailer requirements,” the report continues, “all of them should review and improve policies to ensure access to content is limited to age-appropriate consumers.” Reached for comment, an ESRB representative said the organization is pleased with the Commission’s findings. “Our 2018 research shows that 83% of parents are aware of ESRB ratings, and 73% regularly check the ratings prior to making a purchase,” they said. “That said, ESRB is always looking at potential enhancements to the rating system as the industry evolves and parental demands change. “While the ESRB rating system is a great way to get information about what’s in a game, we also recommend that parents set parental controls for all of their family’s consoles, handheld video game devices, computers, and smart devices. Of course, we also encourage parents to take the time to talk with their children about what kinds of games are appropriate for their family, and why.” The Commission’s report also offers guidance on the placement of guns in schools as a deterrent to active shooters. The discussion of firearms follows early questions that surfaced about the Commission’s methods and processes. In a bizarre exchange in June, for instance, secretary DeVos said that the group would investigate both video games and social media, but not firearms “per se.” That was despite the fact that a directive to look at firearms was written into the Commission’s own web page. Later, the Commission heard testimony from two different psychologists, both of whom urged them to take time to actually consider the role that firearms play in school shootings. The request seems to have stuck, as a significant portion of the report deals with current and proposed gun laws. The Commission says that it looked carefully at research on minimum age of gun purchase laws. Those laws are ineffective, it reasoned, because most mass shooters just found guns laying around in their homes. The U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Secret Service reviewed 37 incidents of targeted school violence between 1974 and 2000 and found that most attackers had access to and had used weapons prior to the attack. More than two-thirds of the attackers acquired the gun (or guns) used in their attacks from their own home or that of a relative. The School Associated Death Study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control found similar results in a study of 323 school-associated violent death events that occurred between 1992 and 1999. Of the firearms used to commit homicides, 23.4 percent were obtained from the home of the perpetrator and 27.6 percent came from a friend or a relative. The only way forward, said the Commission, is to conduct more research. In the meantime, the Commission said that it supports state and local efforts to get guns directly into schools. “States and local communities,” the Commission said, “in concert with law enforcement, should consider various approaches to school safety based on their own unique needs. School districts may consider arming some specially selected and trained school personnel (including but not limited to [school resource officers] and [school safety officers]) as a deterrent.” During today’s teleconference, a senior Trump administration official was clear that the Commission was not recommending that federal funds be used to arm school staff. Related “On the question of arming highly trained school personnel,” the official said, “the report in no place makes the recommendation that we’re going to arm teachers. The inputs that Secretary DeVos and the other Commission members received included existing programs throughout the country, including in places like Arkansas, where highly trained, skilled school personnel in some instances have access to firearms. And some of those school personnel, they can range from extracurricular mentors, custodial staff, administrators, or, in some instances, teachers. But it is in no way the recommendation of the report that federal funds be used to arm school personnel.” The report follows the events of Feb. 14, when a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, resulted in the death of 14 students and three staff. On Feb. 22, President Trump blamed video games and movies for school violence. Then, on Mar. 1, he invited members of the video game industry to the White House. The Federal Commission on School Safety later assembled on Mar. 12. “After the tragedy in Parkland, Florida, this administration took swift action,” said DeVos today. “No parent should fear for their child’s life when they go to school, and no student or teacher should ever have to worry about their safety at school.” The Commission’s report is just that — a report — and is non-binding. Nevertheless, it will serve as a baseline for discussions about school safety around the country, now and in the future.

Status: 404",2018-12-18 16:01:18, The Latest: NRA 'disappointed' by bump stock ban,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
261,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-bumpstocks/trump-bans-bump-stocks-used-in-mass-las-vegas-shooting-idUSKBN1OH1WW?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Lisa Lambert 3 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday banned the high-power gun attachments of the type used in last year’s Las Vegas shooting massacre of 58 people, giving the owners of “bump stocks” 90 days to turn in or destroy the devices and blocking owners from being able to register them. President Donald Trump’s Republican Party typically supports gun ownership, and its members have fiercely fought off perceived threats to the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment guaranteeing Americans the right to bear arms. His administration, though, is sidestepping any potential debate in Congress in issuing a final rule on Tuesday that adds bump stocks to a definition of machine guns written 80 years ago, during the heyday of gangsters’ use of “tommy guns.” The attachments use a gun’s recoil to bump its trigger, enabling a semiautomatic weapon to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, which can transform the firearm into a machine gun. The Justice Department’s regulation follows the lead of many states and retailers that imposed stricter limits on sales of guns and accessories after a deadly shooting in February at a Florida high school. Gun Owners of America said on Tuesday that it was going to court to fight the new rule and would seek an injunction. The group said the department was attempting to rewrite laws, the regulation would lead to bans on other weapons, and bump stocks do not qualify as machine guns. On an earlier call with reporters, senior Justice Department officials said they were ready for any possible lawsuit and confident in the review of case law they conducted while writing and revising the regulation. The department received nearly 190,000 comments on its proposal for the regulation. The websites for the most well-known bump stock manufacturers, Bumpfire System and Slide Fire, displayed notifications on Tuesday that they had already ceased direct sales of the devices. RW Arms, which both manufacturers described as a leading retailer, was not immediately available to comment on the ban. While bump stocks are not widespread, they are still plentiful in the market, with high sales over the internet and in big-box stores, the officials said on the call. Walmart Inc stopped selling assault firearms and accessories in 2015. After the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the retailer raised the minimum age for buying guns at its stores. Other retailers, including Kroger Co, have also raised the minimum buying age.

262,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/588099504/0/phoenix/nation~news-year-in-review-Stories-across-United-States-that-moved-us/,"In 2018, the eyes of the nation were again fixed on President Donald Trump, whose second year in office was no less remarkable than his first. It was a year that saw the president open up trade wars, meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, spar with the press and defend hush money payments to women he allegedly had affairs with, all while new revelations and indictments poured out of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling. Policies and politics divided us. We found ourselves embroiled in a fierce immigration debate. Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ascended to the high court despite sexual assault allegations from Christine Blasey Ford. Nature humbled us. California burned as the Camp Fire became the most destructive in state history. Hurricane winds and floods battered the Carolinas. But other stories made us proud. Team USA brought home 23 Olympic medals from Pyeongchang, South Korea. Teachers fought for better pay. We exercised our rights, voting in the most tumultuous midterms in years. Democrats gained control of the House, Republicans expanded their Senate majority, and voters made history, ushering into Congress many firsts for women and minorities. Then, we ended the year with a solemn goodbye. Funeral services for George H.W. Bush were a farewell not only to a former president, but also to a generation. After another eventful year, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state that moved us – the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about. Read more: The former Alabama senator's beleaguered tenure as U.S. Attorney General finally ended in November, one day after the midterm elections. While Sessions was one of President Donald Trump’s earliest supporters, he was berated by the commander-in-chief for recusing himself from the investigation into Russian meddling of the 2016 presidential election. Sessions' departure was just one of the many notable firings and resignations from the Trump administration in 2018, including chief of staff John Kelly and secretary of state Rex Tillerson. As for the Russia investigation: Trump has denied wrongdoing, and repeatedly called special counsel Robert Mueller's looming investigation a ""witch hunt."" Earlier this month, Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison – the first sentencing for a member of the president's inner circle, and one that could hold legal perils for Trump. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck near Anchorage on Nov. 30 sliced opened roads, knocked out power and damaged buildings. Over 3,000 aftershocks have rattled the region, though no deaths or serious injuries were reported. Meanwhile, recovery efforts, made more difficult by the cold, have become the envy of the nation after work crews repaired major road damage within four days after the quake. Delivery of food supplies, fuel and other cargo has not been interrupted, according to officials, who said that crews will redo the majority of their work in the summer to ensure long-term sustainability. Christine Blasey Ford testified with quiet, measured emotion that Brett Kavanaugh forced her onto a bed and tried to remove her clothes at a party when both were teens. Kavanaugh yelled, cried and interrupted when it was his turn in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. A day later, a protester who said she was sexually assaulted approached outgoing Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake in an elevator. ""You're telling me that my assault doesn't matter,"" the audibly emotional woman told Flake. The moment seemed to matter, as it was Flake, alongside Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who called for a week-long FBI investigation. Ultimately, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court. An Arkansas family's tragic photo captured hearts around the nation in June as it showed the moment a brother said goodbye to his dying little sister. Adalynn Sooter, 4, lost her battle with a rare brain tumor, but her siblings got one last chance to spend time together. Jackson, 6, rubbed his sister's head as she grasped his hand. Then Jackson said goodnight. Addy was Jackson's ""playmate, his best friend, his little sister,"" father Matt Sooter wrote on Facebook. ""This isn't how it's supposed to be."" Though her condition worsened and the rare tumor took her life hours later, the family found hope: ""She wasn't in any pain at the end,"" her father wrote. 6,228 wildfires. Over 876,000 acres charred. At least 100 deaths. California was devastated by historic blazes this year which will likely impact the state for decades. In Northern California, the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in state history, killed nearly three times as many people as the Griffith Park Fire – a record that stood for 85 years. And the worst may be yet to come: According to a new study, wildfires in California may be more commonplace with the brutal combination of hot and dry weather linked to climate change. Meanwhile, homeowners affected by the deadly blazes face dilemmas on whether to rebuild in high-risk areas repeatedly ravaged by fires. Christopher Watts gave an emotional TV interview the day after his pregnant wife and two daughters were reported missing in August, pleading for their safe return. Shortly after, he was arrested and charged in their gruesome deaths. Watts drove the bodies to an oil field and buried his wife in a shallow grave. He shoved Bella and Celeste in two separate oil tanks, pushing their bodies through openings that were only 8 inches in diameter. In November, the suburban Denver dad was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison and 84 additional years with no possibility of parole. A former substitute teacher at a Connecticut high school was fired and faced charges after police discovered he was running a ""fight club"" inside of his math class. Ryan Fish, 23, encouraged high school students in Montville to physically battle as students recorded the fights and cheered. Police became involved when a social worker reported a 15-year-old student was traumatized after being robbed and beaten by his classmates. Fish was fired from his position at the school and faced felony and misdemeanor charges associated with child endangerment. Those charges will be dropped if Fish completes the state's accelerated rehabilitation program, a judge ruled in October. As poison dripped into her veins, Kathleen Krakowski heard birds chirping and watched leaves sway in the wind. Krakowski, a breast cancer patient, sat in chemotherapy at the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute in Newark, but she gazed into a serene forest within a virtual reality headset. ""It doesn't look fake at all,"" she said. Patients could also sit on the beach or admire a mountainside, forgetting – if only for minutes – the sterile hospital room and deadly illnesses, nurses said. More health-focused VR programs are coming to ease challenges for women in labor and those in chronic pain, too, VR companies VRHealth and Oculus announced in September. Parkland became the site of a mass school shooting when a former student killed 17 people, including students, a football coach and an athletic director, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine’s Day. Police arrested Nikolas Cruz, who now faces the death penalty among other charges. Cruz was known to police, who had received 18 calls between 2008 and 2017 warning about him – some directly concerned about him opening fire at school. Amid criticism, an armed school resource officer who never went into the school during the shooting retired. But Parkland students emerged from the tragedy fueling a movement and marches against gun violence across the nation that also targeted NRA-backed candidates in midterm elections. The students were recently awarded a global peace award and praised as ""true change-makers."" When many Americans were asking who to vote for on election day, claims of voter suppression left some Georgians asking whether their votes would be counted fairly. In a close race, Democrat Stacey Abrams vied to become the nation's first black woman governor, while Republican Brian Kemp sought to maintain his party's control of the office. Kemp won, but both sides claimed foul play by the other. Abrams accused Kemp of trying to suppress Democratic votes as secretary of state by removing voters from the rolls. Kemp's office said it was investigating Democrats for what it called a ""failed attempt to hack"" the registration system. And the fight isn't over: An Abrams-backed group recently filed a federal lawsuit asking a judge to order fixes to what it says are deep-seated problems in the state's election system. Hawaiians were sent scrambling one January morning after an emergency alert notification warned of an incoming ballistic missile threat. Residents and vacationers ran for cover and called loved ones thinking death was imminent. The only problem? The alert was an error. Officials knew within three minutes that the error had happened, but it took 38 minutes to send out the false alarm message. The unsettling notification came after months of aggressive rhetoric from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who had threatened to strike the United States. President Donald Trump later met Kim to discuss denuclearization at a much-hyped summit in Singapore. A historic handshake between the two represented the first time a sitting U.S. president met with a North Korean leader and a major breakthrough in decades of tensions. An Idaho boy who protected the American flag with his body stirred the patriotism of a nation in September. Fifth-grader Jack LeBreck lay on the ground under the flag as two other boys struggled to fold it on a windy day. The moment of respect was captured by a passerby who shared the image to Facebook, where it soon made national headlines. The image was so iconic that some questioned its authenticity. ""Was it staged?"" some asked photographer and Facebook user Amanda Reallan. Most certainly was not: ""These boys had no idea I was taking the photo,"" she said. ""They took it upon themselves to protect the flag."" Jemel Roberson was doing his job when a suburban Chicago police officer fatally shot him. The 26-year-old armed guard, who was black, had detained a suspected gunman at the bar where he worked and was waiting for police help when an officer, who is white, opened fire on him. Police say the officer ordered Roberson to drop his gun. Witnesses say they shouted that Roberson was a security guard. Roberson's death prompted cries for justice from civil rights advocates and a federal lawsuit filed by his mother against the still unnamed police officer and Midlothian, where the officer is from. And his death was just one at the hands of police in 2018. The fallout from the sexual abuse committed by Larry Nassar further engulfed Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics in 2018, threatening to swallow up top executives and the sport governing body itself. Criminal cases ended in February against Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor convicted of sexually assaulting young gymnasts. USA Gymnastics' CEO resigned in September, forced out under heavy criticism. The organization filed for bankruptcy protection in December, sagging under the weight of lawsuits from survivors of Nassar's abuse. The next week, a chief for the U.S. Olympic Committee was fired after a report found both the committee and USA Gymnastics failed ""to adopt appropriate child-protective policies"" to prevent abuse. Mollie Tibbetts was last seen running along Boundary and Middle Streets in her hometown Brooklyn on July 18, surveillance footage shows. The 20-year-old University of Iowa student was reported missing the next day, sparking a monthlong search that gripped Americans from Iowa to the White House. ""I just want Mollie's family to know: You're on the hearts of every American,"" Vice President Mike Pence said Aug. 15. Authorities found her body in a cornfield southeast of Brooklyn six days later, and charged Cristhian Rivera, a 24-year-old Mexican national, with first-degree murder. Rivera, who led police to the body, said he ""blocked"" his memory after pursuing Tibbetts during her run. He pleaded not guilty to the charge. A South Korean-born teenager who was adopted by her aunt and uncle in Kansas will soon be forced out of the country. Now-retired Army Lt. Col. Patrick Schreiber and his wife Soo Jin delayed a formal adoption of daughter Hyebin, in large part because Schreiber, a 27-year Army veteran, was deployed in Afghanistan where he served as an intelligence officer. Following poor legal advice, the parents formally adopted their daughter a year too late, when she was 17 – one year after the cutoff for a foreign-born child to derive citizenship from an American, according to immigration law. In September, a federal judge said the girl must leave the country immediately after she graduates Kansas University. The family said if their daughter is deported, they will move to South Korea. Minutes after trying to break into a predominately black church, a shooter gunned down two black shoppers at a Kroger grocery store in Jeffersontown in October. The suspect, Gregory Bush, was charged with federal hate crimes, and reportedly told another man who shot at him in the store's parking lot, ""Don’t shoot me. I won’t shoot you. Whites don’t shoot whites."" The community mourned the deaths of Vickie Lee Jones, 67, and Maurice E. Stallard, 69, who was shopping with his grandson at the time of the shooting. More than 50,000 American women are severely injured during childbirth each year. About 700 die. Why? Medical workers skip safety practices known to head off disaster. And the deadliest state for pregnant women and new mothers is Louisiana, according to a USA TODAY investigation, ""Deadly Deliveries."" There were 58.1 deaths for every 100,000 births in the Pelican State from 2012 to 2016. Half of these deaths could be prevented, best estimates say, and half the injuries reduced or prevented with better care. Through our investigation, USA TODAY contacted 75 hospitals in 13 states to ask if they followed certain nationally recognized safety practices. Half wouldn’t answer. At Charlotte's Legendary Lobster Pound, your lobster might get smoked before it gets steamed. The restaurant in Southwest Harbor experimented with using marijuana to ease lobsters' pain before the steaming process. Owner Charlotte Gill said she tried it with a lobster named Roscoe, placing him in a covered box with two inches of water as marijuana smoke was pumped inside. Gill said Roscoe was more calm following his smokeout. PETA is not convinced, though. ""There is a well-established, foolproof way to prevent crustaceans from suffering, though, and that's by not eating them."" The shooting was ""like a war zone."" Five newspaper employees were killed when a gunman with a grudge opened fire on the Capital Gazette in the Annapolis. The victims: assistant editor and columnist Rob Hiaasen, special publications editor Wendi Winters, writer John McNamara, editorial page editor Gerald Fischman and sales assistant Rebecca Smith. Jarrod Ramos, now charged with five murder counts, had sued the paper over a 2011 article about his guilty plea for harassment, and he had unleashed vitriol on social media against the paper and its staff for years. But the tragedy didn't stop Capital Gazette journalists from doing their jobs after their colleagues had been killed and ""putting out a damn paper"" the next day. In December, they, along with murdered Saudi Arabian writer Jamal Khashoggi and other journalists, were named as TIME magazine's 2018 Person of the Year. The natural gas industry and government regulators have known the dangers of leaking gas pipelines for decades. Repairing those pipes is not only difficult and expensive, but also sometimes perilous. In September, utility crews upgrading cast iron pipes inadvertently caused fires and explosions in three northern Massachusetts towns, killing one person, injuring 21 others and leaving hundreds homeless. Investigators say Columbia Gas issued faulty work orders that contributed to the blasts. The Merrimack Valley, the area north of Boston shaken by explosions, is served by some of the nation's oldest and most leak-prone pipes, according to a USA TODAY analysis. The explosions could become the most expensive natural gas disaster ever for a utility that was already spending $80 million this year to upgrade an aging infrastructure. Aretha Franklin, the ""Queen of Soul"" whose music shaped the American songbook for over 50 years, died of pancreatic cancer in August. Franklin was a transcendent cultural figure of the 20th century. She sang for presidents and royalty, and befriended high-profile leaders such as the Revs. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse Jackson. Amid the global glitter and acclaim, she remained loyal to her adopted home, living in the Detroit area for decades. Her marathon, 8-hour funeral featured speakers like Former President Bill Clinton and legendary record producer Clive Davis and included musical tributes from Stevie Wonder, Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson. Rev. Al Sharpton called Franklin’s career the soundtrack to the Civil Rights Movement, saying ""We don’t all agree on everything, but we agree on Aretha."" In a historic midterm season, Minnesota elected Ilhan Omar to the House of Representatives in November, where she will serve as one of the first ever Muslim women in Congress. Omar, a Somali-American former refugee, was elected alongside Rashida Tlaib in Michigan, Congress's only other Muslim woman. And they weren't alone as the 2018 elections were marked by groundbreaking firsts around the country. Deb Haaland and Sharice Davids will serve as the first Native American women in Congress. New York elected Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will be the youngest woman in Congress. In Colorado, Jared Polis was the first openly gay man to win a governor’s race in American history. Here are all the firsts from the 2018 midterms. Sixty-three years have passed since Emmett Till’s gruesome murder, but the FBI announced in July it was reopening investigations into the black teen’s historic death ""after receiving new information."" Till was visiting relatives in Money in 1955 when a white woman, Carolyn Bryant Donham, accused him of sexual harassment. Till’s body, beaten and shot, was found three days later, igniting a national debate about race and violence. Today, his family is still searching for the truth. ""We want the process to work, and we want justice to prevail for Emmett,"" Deborah Watts, Till's cousin, told USA TODAY. ""This cannot just be forgotten."" In July, an amphibious duck boat capsized during a severe storm on Table Rock Lake in Branson, leaving 17 dead, including nine members of the same family. ""My heart is very heavy,"" said Tia Coleman, who lost her husband and three kids and was one of the surviving members of the Coleman family aboard the boat. Duck boats have a long history of serious accidents, leaving more than 40 people dead since 1999. As part of an investigation into the incident, the duck boat’s captain was indicted on criminal charges last month. In September, Tia Coleman filed a lawsuit against the boat operators and manufacturer. Two U.S. citizens at a northern Montana gas station were questioned by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer for speaking Spanish earlier this year. Ana Suda captured video of the now viral encounter, where she and her friend were asked for identification because of the language they were speaking inside a convenience store gas station about 35 miles south of the U.S.-Canada border. Suda accused the agent of racial profiling. Responding to questions about the incident and whether or not to speak Spanish publicly, acting CBP commissioner Ronald Vitiello later said ""It’s not something people should be concerned about if they’re here legally."" The first person ever executed in the U.S. using fentanyl had three last words for his witnesses: ""I love you."" Carey Dean Moore died Aug. 14 from a fatal mixture including the drug, the first such execution in the United States and Nebraska's first lethal injection of any kind. Moore, 60, had faced death after killing two cab drivers in the summer of 1979. Death penalty opponents feared that the mixture with fentanyl – an opioid more potent than heroin – could have inflicted extreme pain had the substances not worked as planned. In a last statement, Moore apologized to his brother, a witness to the first murder: ""Please forgive me, Don, somehow."" Nevada voters elected a legal pimp who had died several weeks prior in a November state assembly race. Dennis Hof was known as a flamboyant and notorious brothel owner, reality TV star and later Republican politician. A rally for Hof’s campaign took place just hours before his Oct. 16 death at the age of 72 – that rally attracted high-profile conservative speakers including Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Fox News personality Tucker Carlson. Following his death, Hof remained on the ballot and cruised to an easy victory in his Assembly District race. His win kicked off a lengthy and competitive process to appoint a living Republican to the seat. A mystery New Hampshire lottery winner who won a $560 million Powerball prize can remain anonymous, a judge ruled in March. The woman won the Powerball drawing Jan. 6, and the state Attorney General's Office had argued that her identity must be revealed because she signed her name on the back of the ticket. The woman, who filed a suit under the pseudonym Jane Doe, said she made a ""huge mistake"" when she signed her real name before contacting a lawyer. The woman could remain anonymous had she established a trust, then had a trustee sign the ticket, her lawyers argued. In October, the ticket for an even bigger prize – a whopping $1.537 billion Mega Millions jackpot – was sold in South Carolina, but the prize was still unclaimed in November. Snooki, The Situation and the rest of the ""Jersey Shore"" cast returned for a two-season reboot filled with plenty of ""duck face"" and nostalgia for the reality show that premiered in 2009. The cast partied in Miami Beach, Florida and Las Vegas before heading to – where else – Atlantic City. This time around, the cast dealt with more than just the cabs being here, as the show touched on issues like sobriety and parenthood. And ""Jersey Shore"" wasn’t the only reboot this year. ""The Ocean"" franchise, ""A Star is Born"" and a spooky new take on ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" all made their way back to our screens in 2018. ""We are starving and need food and water."" The message from inside a ""third-world""-like compound in New Mexico led authorities to a gruesome discovery in August. Eleven children were rescued amid a search for three-year-old Georgia boy Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, whose father allegedly abducted him. Police found the children with a group of heavily armed Muslims living on property they didn't own in a compound built from wooden pallets, clear plastic tarps and dirt-filled tires. The toddler's body was later found buried on the site. One of the rescued children told authorities the group's leader believed the dead child would be reincarnated to launch an attack on banks, schools and other ""corrupt"" institutions. Now, five adults from the compound face firearms-related charges and accusations that a group member had been training children and others in military tactics. Did President Donald Trump turn his Trump Foundation into a political tool? Allegations ""sufficiently support a claim that Mr. Trump intentionally used Foundation assets for his private interests knowing that it may not be in the Foundation's best interest,"" New York Supreme Court Judge Saliann Scarpulla said in a ruling last month that cleared the way for a civil lawsuit against the Trump Foundation. An investigation led New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood to allege Trump used the foundation as ""little more than a checkbook"" to promote his businesses and presidential campaign. The lawsuit spurred an investigation of the organization's tax practices by the state Tax Department, and the Trump Foundation agreed to dissolve in December. Add to that the alleged tax evasion and ""outright fraud"" by the Trump family as reported by the New York Times in October. The Times' investigation sparked a separate state inquiry into Trump. Hurricane Florence brought catastrophic flooding to North Carolina and surrounding states in September, causing billions of dollars in property damage and shattering all-time rainfall and flood records in the Carolinas. More than 50 people died in the storm, despite warnings from local authorities to evacuate. One North Carolina mayor warned residents to notify their next of kin if they planned to weather the storm. In the storm's wake, flooding cut off access to towns both large and small. After the rain stopped, residents began to grapple with the devastation, including heavy losses to agriculture and animals. More than a million chickens died, fish carcasses needed to be hosed off of roads and overflowing pig waste created a disgusting, hazardous mess. Miss North Dakota Cara Mund won the title of Miss America 2018 – the first from her state to take the crown – but less than three weeks before the 2019 pageant this September, Mund publicly accused Miss America CEO Regina Hopper and chairwoman Gretchen Carlson of bullying and silencing her. Carlson, a former Miss America winner and Fox News host, said the organization lost $75,000 in potential scholarship funds as a result of the accusations. The Miss America Organization had been taking public steps in the name of female-empowerment, but infighting and controversy surrounding the pageant has been making headlines ever since Carlson announced the ceremony would no longer feature a swimsuit competition for the first time in its 98-year history. After the overhaul, the pageant lost one million television viewers, and many were unhappy with the changes. In November, Ohio authorities charged six family members in connection with one of the state’s most heinous crimes: A massacre that left eight members of another family dead in four different locations. Authorities allege that a child custody dispute motivated members of the Wagner family to murder Rhoden family members in April 2016, leaving some experts stunned that a custody dispute could lead to such a crime. ""They did this quickly, coldly, calmly and very carefully, but not carefully enough,"" Pike County Sheriff Charles S. Reader said of the charges. Four Wagner family members have pled not guilty to murder charges, while two other family members face related charges. Kyler Murray became the second Oklahoma quarterback in a row to win the Heisman Trophy. But then, homophobic tweets from when he was 15 years old resurfaced. Murray, 21 now, apologized, and joined several other famous athletes thrust into a negative light in 2018 for previous social media activity. Milwaukee Brewers' Josh Hader had racist, homophobic and misogynistic tweets resurface. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen saw racist tweets resurface from his teenage years ahead of the NFL draft. Villanova Final Four Most Outstanding Player Donte DiVincenzo had a profane tweet surface right after he helped the Wildcats win a national title. In the world of entertainment, comedian Kevin Hart refused to apologize in December for past offensive tweets, and the resulting crisis led him to recuse himself from hosting the Oscars. Days before the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy sparked nationwide marches in June, protesters in Oregon were arrested after setting up a makeshift camp on the grounds of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland. A few dozen protesters confronted police with profanities and chants such as ""No justice, no peace, no racist police."" Federal police arrested several demonstrators on June 28, but protests and arrests at the location continued into July. The backlash was tied to calls by some progressives on the left to abolish ICE – a message that helped propel some Democrats, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to victory in the midterms. The movement also helped boost some Republicans, who argued against lax law enforcement. Barry Werber hid in a storeroom. Judah Samet was four minutes late. Both survived what would become the deadliest attack in U.S. history targeting American Jews when a gunman hurling anti-Semitic epithets fatally shot 11 people on the Sabbath at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Even before the attack, violence and harassment of Jewish people and institutions was rising sharply. There were at least 1,986 incidents motivated by anti-Jewish bias – including physical assaults, vandalism and attacks on Jewish institutions – in 2017 in the United States, a 57 percent spike in incidents over the year before, according to the Anti-Defamation League. A Mexican restaurant in Westerly got some backlash for selling T-shirts it says advocated impeaching President Donald Trump. The shirts, which read ""86 45,"" were worn by restaurant staffers on Election Day. That was just one showing of how the man not on the ballot (Trump) was actually a big factor in this year's midterms. Trump didn't shy from making the Nov. 6 election a referendum on him, holding huge rallies in a string of red and swing states and telling crowds that a vote for the local Senate or House candidate was ""a vote for me."" Midterms are often a judgment about the sitting president, but never in modern times did one campaign so hard to make sure it was. A bloody, seven-hour riot at Lee Correctional Institution, a 1,785-bed maximum security prison in rural South Carolina, put the state's criminal justice system back in the national spotlight. The April melee left seven inmates dead and over a dozen others injured in what is considered the nation's deadliest prison riot in a quarter-century. While state officials attributed the deaths to gangs, some blamed the outbreak of violence on living conditions. A 2010 criminal justice reform package allowed the state to close three maximum-security prisons and slash millions of dollars in annual prison spending from its budget – making the state's prison system among the country’s cheapest for taxpayers but also one of the deadliest for inmates. In August, a nationwide prison strike, created in response to the brutal brawl, aimed to raise awareness on the lack of mental health and rehabilitation programs in the state. Vermillion native Paul Erickson made national headlines when accused Russian spy Maria Butina, his business partner and roommate, was arrested and charged in Washington in July for allegedly seeking to exploit political groups to try to advance Russian interests. Once a political provocateur, Erickson had virtually disappeared from South Dakota's political scene in recent years, but in March 2015, Butina reached out to an American matching his description, prosecutors said. Erickson, 56, reportedly helped shepherd the alleged Russian operative to the National Rifle Association and conservative political group meetings. And Butina’s goal to build a backchannel communication line between Russia and the United States appeared to show some success. Erickson allegedly provided contacts while a Russian official directed her. In December, Butina pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an agent for the Kremlin without registering in the United States. In April, thousands of admirers of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gathered at his memorial to mark 50 years since the assassination of the civil rights leader whose message of non-violence continues to resonate across racial and religious divides in our nation. King was shot on April 4, 1968, as he stood on a balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. The night before his death, witnesses like Clara Ester heard King all but give his own eulogy, saying he had seen the Promised Land but he ""may not get there with you."" Yet some civil rights leaders have questioned if the U.S. is moving backward on race relations, saying if King was alive today ""he’d be confounded by how little has changed."" A large caravan of thousands of Central American migrants brought immigration front and center. The Trump administration vigorously pursued options to restrict or block outright migrants' ability to enter the country, including denying asylum. President Donald Trump also ordered thousands of active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. Over the summer, Trump enacted (and then back-tracked on) an ill-fated ""zero tolerance"" policy that led to more than 2,500 family separations along the border. At the time, the eyes of the world focused on the small city of McAllen – a town with Border Patrol's busiest station for apprehending and detaining immigrants suspected of entering the country illegally. In 2018, the USA TODAY Network also won a Pulitzer Prize for its project The Wall, a landmark multi-platform project that examined Trump's campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Before Team USA brought home 23 medals from the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, its skiers and snowboarders trained hard in Utah. Park City plays home to U.S. Ski and Snowboard's Center for Excellence facility, where star athletes like Lindsey Vonn readied for the 23rd Games. While Vonn, widely considered the best female Alpine skier ever, returned with just one bronze medal, snowboard halfpipe prodigy Chloe Kim and Shaun White, perhaps the best to ever ride a board, both brought home gold – a cementing of snowboarding's status from outcast to darling of the Winter Olympics. In 2018, Vermont became the ninth state to legalize recreational marijuana and the first to do so through its state legislature. (Later in the year, Michigan became the 10th.) Marijuana has become big business in other states that have legalized it, generating an estimated $1.6 billion in tax revenue. But Vermont has taken a different approach. The state will continue to ban marijuana sales to the general public, and the law leaves open a murky question about marijuana ""gifting."" In Massachusetts, which legalized marijuana in 2016, the state opened its first commercial pot shops in November. Alexa, what’s National Landing? Pretty soon, the answer will be the site of one half of Amazon’s HQ2. The tech giant chose the Northern Virginia region straddling Arlington County and the City of Alexandria, and Long Island City, New York, as the locations for its two new headquarters. The November announcement came after 14 months of intense jockeying by more than 230 cities vying for the honor of playing host to the Amazon’s second headquarters. Amazon is expected to bring 25,000 high-paying jobs and invest $2.5 billion in each location. The decision left many cities wondering what could have been and current residents worried their new neighbors might bring public transport nightmares and skyrocketing housing prices. Under CEO Jeff Bezos, who is now the richest person in the world with a net worth of an estimated $166 billion, Amazon also became the second publicly traded company in the U.S. with a stock market value above $1 trillion this year. The days of the plastic straw are numbered. In July, Seattle became one of the largest cities to ban plastic straws. Coffee giant Starbucks, headquartered in Washington state, said they would phase plastic straws out by 2020, too. And some chains like Red Lobster chose only to give out plastic straws upon request. The changes are part of a growing national trend to rid ourselves of what some perceive as an environmental waste. The nonprofit group Sailors for the Sea said plastic straws are among the top 10 marine debris collected during the International Coastal Cleanup. But we really seem to love them: Americans use an estimated 500 million single-use straws daily, according to Eco-Cycle. Fortunately, we have plenty of eco-friendly alternatives. Educators in West Virginia went on strike for nine days in February and March, capturing the national spotlight and forcing school closures across the state with more than 30,000 teachers and support staff demanding pay raises. Gov. Jim Jordan signed a contract agreeing to a five percent raise for state educators, but West Virginia teacher salaries are still some of the lowest in the nation, according the American Federation of Teachers. Meanwhile, teachers' discontent across the country bubbled up this year as educators struggled to keep up with early days and to pay for classroom supplies out of their own pockets. From Arizona to Kentucky, similar protests broke out, demanding better pay and benefits. Few states fell into the crossfires of President Donald Trump's trade wars more than Wisconsin. ""It's been catastrophic,"" Rob Parmentier, CEO of a Wisconsin-based boat manufacturer, said in October. Retaliatory tariffs from China, Europe, Canada and Mexico came in response to Trump's tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. Those trade barriers affected everything from manufacturing to farming, including the state's iconic dairy industry: Wholesale cheese and butter prices slumped in the summer as farmers faced an oversupply of milk and tensions with Wisconsin's top two trading partners, Canada and Mexico. House Speaker Paul Ryan urged fellow Wisconsinites to ""be patient"" with the tariffs. Meanwhile, hundreds of dairy farms closed across the state – about 430 by September. Twenty years after Matthew Shepard's death, his ashes found a home at the Washington National Cathedral. Shepard has become an international symbol of the violence LGBTQ people in America face after his death in 1998, when two men savagely beat him then tied him to a fence near Laramie. In their confessions, the assailants said they targeted Shepard because he was gay. Since Shepard's death, same-sex marriage was legalized as well as the ability of transgender Americans to serve in the military. But LGBTQ advocates say more work needs to be done. ""Violence against us continues to this day,"" said Rt. Rev. V. Gene Robinson, the openly gay former bishop who presided over a service remembering Shepard in October. The Washington Capitals ended D.C.'s more than 20 year drought without a major pro sports title when the team took down the Vegas Golden Knights in the Stanley Cup Finals in June. It was pandemonium in the streets of the nation's capital after the team's 4-3 victory in Game 5, followed by a boozy championship parade and rally on the National Mall days later. The win also marked the first Stanley Cup title in the franchise's 44-year history, and Caps great Alex Ovechkin won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, leading his team with 15 postseason goals.

Sullivan on Tuesday postponed the sentencing of Michael Flynn, President Trump's former national security adviser, after harshly criticizing the retired three-star general for lying to FBI agents investigating Russia's election meddling, and working to advance Turkey's interests while part of Trump's campaign. ""Arguably, you sold your country out,"" the judge said. After Sullivan warned Flynn still could face prison despite cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, Flynn's lawyer requested the delay in the hope that Flynn could earn the court's mercy by further helping prosecutors. Flynn pleaded guilty more than a year ago to lying about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. 2 The White House hinted Tuesday that President Trump could back down from his threat to allow a partial government shutdown unless he gets $5 billion he wants for his proposed border wall in a year-end spending bill. The bill must be passed by midnight Friday to avoid a shutdown, and last week Trump met with Democratic leaders and said he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government for the cause of border security. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday, however, that the Trump administration could support the $1.6 billion in border security funding proposed by Senate Democrats. ""We have other ways that we can get to that $5 billion"" and will ""work with Congress"" to do so, she said. 3 The Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved the biggest overhaul of the federal criminal justice system in decades. The bill, the First Step Act, was passed 87-12, with backing from both conservatives and liberals. It seeks to change tough-on-crime prison and sentencing laws that have increased prison populations and created what critics on both sides of the aisle have called an unfair criminal justice system. The bill creates more rehabilitation programs, eases mandatory minimum sentencing, reduces the three-strike penalty from life in prison to 25 years, and lets some federal inmates earn time credits by taking part in special programs. The legislation now moves to the House, where it also has bipartisan support. President Trump tweeted Tuesday that he looks ""forward to signing this into law!"" 4 President Trump's charitable foundation agreed to shut down in a deal reached with New York's attorney general. The deal will resolve allegations that the Trump Foundation misused assets to settle some of Trump's business disputes and support his bid for the White House. The agreement, which was reached under court supervision, also calls for distributing the foundation's remaining $1.7 million to other nonprofit groups. Despite the deal, state Attorney General Barbara Underwood's lawsuit accusing the Trumps of illegally running the foundation as part of their real estate empire and Trump's presidential campaign remains ongoing. It seeks $2.8 million in restitution and a 10-year ban to prevent Trump and his three eldest children from operating charities in the state. 5 Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), who narrowly lost her midterm Senate bid to Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), will fill the seat vacated by late Sen. John McCain, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) announced Tuesday. Arizona had never sent a woman to the Senate before this year, and now it will be represented by two. After McCain's death in August, former Sen. John Kyl (R-Ariz.) temporarily rejoined the chamber to fill the seat, but only promised to serve until the end of the year. Kyl formally announced his resignation last week, leaving Ducey to appoint another replacement. McSally will now serve until a special election can be held in 2020. 6 The Trump administration on Tuesday announced a ban on bump stocks, attachments that let semi-automatic rifles fire like fully automatic machine guns. Calls for banning the devices began after they were used last year in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which left 58 people dead and hundreds injured in Las Vegas. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker signed the regulation, which will take effect 90 days after it is published in the Federal Register, which could happen Friday. Once that happens, bump stock owners will have to destroy the accessories or hand them over to federal authorities. 7 The U.S. and Mexico on Tuesday announced a plan to work together to discourage migration from Central America. The U.S. pledged a contribution of $10.6 billion, mostly through existing aid programs including loans and other private sector support under the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The agreement marked a symbolic early effort at collaboration by the Trump administration and the government of new Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador after two years of somewhat combative relations between the North American neighbors. Mexico said it would contribute $25 billion to development in southern Mexico over five years, which López Obrador has said could provide employment opportunities for Central Americans. 8 The Clark County, Nevada, Commission on Tuesday appointed Beatrice Duran and Rochell Nguyen to fill two open state Assembly seats, making Nevada the first state with a female-majority legislature. When lawmakers convene in 2019, the legislature will have women in 32 of the 63 total seats in the state Assembly and Senate. ""A great milestone!"" tweeted Democratic Gov.-elect Steve Sisolak, who voted to approve Duran and Nguyen in his last meeting as Clark County Commission chairman. Half of Nevada's representatives in the U.S. House will be women next year, too. Both of the state's U.S. senators will also be women. Jacky Rosen defeated incumbent Dean Heller in November. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) in 2016 became the first woman elected to represent the state in the U.S. Senate. 9 Just For Men, Ancestry.com, and Jaguar on Tuesday announced they would stop advertising on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show. The departures added to a growing exodus of sponsors from Tucker Carlson Tonight following the host's recent comments suggesting immigrants make the U.S. ""dirtier."" Bowflex, SmileDirectClub, NerdWallet, Minted, Pacific Life, and Indeed had previously abandoned the show. Carlson faced widespread criticism for saying on his Dec. 13 show: ""We have a moral obligation to admit the world's poor, [Democrats] tell us, even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided."" In response to the backlash, Carlson has resisted apologizing, arguing that what he said was ""true,"" and accusing liberal critics of trying to silence him. 10 Actress, director, and producer Penny Marshall died Monday night due to diabetes complications, her family said Tuesday. She was 75. Marshall is best known for her starring role as Laverne DeFazio on the Happy Days spinoff Laverne & Shirley, which ran through the 1970s and '80s. She then went on to direct the Oscar-nominated Awakenings, becoming the second woman to direct a Best Picture nominee. She also directed Big, the first film by a woman director to pass $100 million at the box office, and A League of Their Own. Marshall's most recent project was the still-forthcoming documentary of NBA star turned diplomat Dennis Rodman. Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2021.

265,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/12/19/santa-ana-woman-who-drowned-her-2-month-old-daughter-committed-to-state-hospital/,"Trending: A Santa Ana woman who drowned her baby was committed Wednesday to a state hospital, three weeks after jurors found that she was insane at the time of the murder. Orange County Superior Court Judge Sheila Hanson, acting on the recommendation of mental health experts, ordered that Lucero Carrera spend at least 180 days receiving treatment at a state hospital. “Ms. Carrera, I wish you well,” Hanson said. “There are no winners today.” Carrera, now 33, already has spent more than six years behind bars in county jail and state prison. Jurors, in finding that Carrera was not legally sane when she killed her 2-month-old baby, Kimberly, spared her more time in prison. Carrera, who was living with her mother in Santa Ana, had a lengthy history of mental illness, including a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and several hospitalizations and suicide attempts. She often cycled through manic and depressive states, according to courtroom testimony, and shortly before the drowning had stopped taking her medication, worrying that it was making her drowsy when she wanted to be awake to care for the child. On June 29, 2012, while her mother was on a trip to the store, Carrera ingested a full bottle of medication, removed Kimberly’s clothes, filled a bathtub, closed the bathroom door and held the girl under the water. Carrera’s mother returned to find the girl’s lifeless body in the bathtub. Carrera admitted to officers that she had drowned her daughter. Her attorney, Deputy Public Defender Jennifer Nicolalde, told jurors that Carrera was suffering from delusions, and in her mind was saving the child by making sure the girl wouldn’t suffer what Carrera suffered. During her most recent trial, Deputy District Attorney Mark Birney said Carrera intended to kill herself and take her child with her, describing the drowning as a failed murder-suicide. In 2015, Carrera was convicted of murder, determined by a jury to be sane at the time of the killing and sentenced to 25-years-to-life in prison. The sentence was overturned on appeal, due to concerns about jury instructions in the first trial. A second jury earlier this year found Carrera guilty of murder, but split during deliberations over whether she was sane at the time of the murder. A third jury, focusing solely on the sanity phase of the trial, on Nov. 28 found Carrera not guilty by reason of insanity. After the first period of commitment at a state hospital, the court — based on recommendations from the doctors treating Carrera — will decide what to do next. Carrera cannot be held longer than the 25-years-to-life sentence she would have received if found sane. Get the latest news delivered daily!

266,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/bump-stock-rule-771259/,"Welcome, The gun lobby has invested decades in the fiction that semi-automatic rifles are safe for civilians Reporter President Trump with the NRA's Chris Cox and Wayne LaPierre in May Getty More than a year after the Las Vegas massacre — the deadliest modern mass shooting in America — the Trump administration is using existing law to ban bump stocks, attachments that turn semi-automatic rifles into automatic weapons. The updated rule by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (ATF) “clarifies that bump-stock-type devices are machineguns,” which have been outlawed for decades. Firing from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel on the Las Vegas strip, Stephen Paddock affixed bump stocks to his rifles for his attack on the Route 91 Harvest music festival in October 2017. He killed 59 people and wounded more than 400 others. The new regulation makes plain that the Las Vegas massacre inspired the re-consideration and ban of the devices, which had previously been approved for sale by ATF, including under the Obama administration.

						Muhammad Ali: 4 Ways He Changed America A bump stock replaces the fixed stock at the back of a semi-automatic rifle. As the rifle fires, the bump stock absorbs and then rebounds the recoil, pushing the gun slightly forward into the shooter’s otherwise immobile trigger finger, causing the gun to fire again and again and again without an additional “pull” of the trigger. Because a bump-stock device “automatically re-engages the trigger finger,” ATF has concluded, it is outlawed under laws dating from the 1930s and 1980s.  The administration revealed final regulatory language Tuesday, banning the devices roughly 90 days from now. Existing owners will not be compensated — they must either destroy their bump stocks or surrender them at a local ATF office. “Options for destroying the devices include melting, crushing, or shredding,” the rule advises. With plastic bump stocks, “individuals can use a hammer to break apart the devices.” A cost estimate, included with the rule, anticipates that owners will have to destroy as many as 500,000 bump-stocks, worth approximately $100 million. (The devices currently retail at prices ranging from $100 to $425.) The NRA has been atypically muted in its response to the new rule. The gun lobby had previously backed a federal review to see if bump-stocks complied with existing law, writing: “The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” On Tuesday, NRA spokesperson Jennifer Baker expressed mild concern, called the final rule “disappointing” and suggesting the administration should have carved out an “amnesty” for “law-abiding Americans who relied on prior ATF determinations” that the devices were legal to buy. Why is the NRA not kicking and screaming — or suing? The organization has long touted the distinction between civilian semi-automatic rifles and military guns with fully-automatic capability as the reason civilians should be able to own weapons like the AR-15. The sale of devices like bump stocks that put automatic-fire capability in the hands of the masses had threatened to undermine decades of public marketing and court arguments. Those arguments, however, are not on the level. The unpleasant truth is that semi automatic fire is more accurate than automatic fire. The military instructs soldiers use semi automatic fire in nearly all combat scenarios. And some experts believe Paddock could have killed more people if he’d not used a bump stocks to spray the concert, and instead had targeted his shots into the crowd. The new bump-stock rule is already facing legal challenges. A lawsuit brought by the Firearms Policy Coalition argues that bump stock owners must be compensated for devices that ATF had previously ruled legal: “ATF’s abrupt about-face on this issue..smacks of agency abuse or dereliction of duty in following the law.”  This suit also puts to a test the authority of Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who executed the rule. Whitaker’s appointment by President Trump to act in the stead of Jeff Sessions, who resigned in November, has been challenged as contrary to law that indicates Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should have moved into the acting role. (Trump has nominated former attorney general William Barr has as a permanent replacement.) “Defendant Matthew Whitaker is unable to lawfully perform the duties and responsibilities of Attorney General,” the suit argues. “Since he lacks the authority to sign the Final Rule as Attorney General, the Final Rule must be struck down as invalidly enacted.” In This Article:

Nicholas Slatten was found guilty of first-degree murder by a unanimous federal jury in the death of Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia’y. Slatten, 35, wearing a blue suit and blue tie, was smiling on and off throughout the short hearing, and shrugged to his attorneys when he heard the verdict. No sentencing date has been set. Slatten was first charged in 2008 along with three other contractors for Blackwater, a private military company, but that case was thrown out. When the case was brought back in late 2013, Slatten was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. The other three guards were convicted of charges including manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. The four men were part of a Blackwater security team code-named Raven 23, who shot 31 innocent Iraqis in the traffic circle of Nisur Square in September 2007. The shooting happened after a car bomb exploded in downtown Baghdad. Fourteen of the Iraqis, including women and children, died. Prosecutors in the 2013 trial said Slatten was the person who “initiated the entire incident” when he fired the first shots “without justifications.” But in 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals threw out Slatten’s murder conviction and said he deserved a new trial. That second trial ended in September 2018 when a mistrial was declared after weeks of the jury being unable to reach a unanimous verdict. Blackwater was founded by Erik Prince, who is the brother of Education Secretary Betsy Devos. Since the 2007 shooting, Prince sold the company, which reorganized and now exists as Academi.

Prosecutors said the guard, Nick Slatten, fired the opening shot in a rampage that killed 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians and injured 17 others. This trial was the third time Slatten has been prosecuted on the charge of first-degree murder.
Advertisement The Sept. 16, 2007, attack damaged the U.S. reputation in Iraq. The guards were escorting a convoy through a crowded Baghdad traffic circle to evacuate a U.S. diplomat. Slatten and his team saw a white Kia sedan driving toward their armored vehicles. Based on earlier intelligence, Blackwater guards feared the Kia could contain a car bomb and opened fire with machine guns and grenade launchers. No evidence of a bomb was found in the car. Prosecutors portrayed Slatten as someone who has a deep and singular hatred for the Iraqi people.

Slatten was a former armed services member who started working privately for Blackwater, which was under contract by the State Department to provide services in post-war Iraq. The contractor is now called Academi. Slatten was convicted to life in prison in 2014 but the verdict was thrown out last year on appeal. The second trial ended in a hung jury.

269,https://kotaku.com/the-biggest-video-game-disappointments-of-2018-1831187595,"2018 was the best of times, and the worst of times. We’re here to talk about that second bit, though we’re keeping things focused on video games.  If we went any broader, this would take all day. As we do every year at Kotaku, it’s time to take a look back on the highs and lows of the last 12 months. Today, we’ll focus on the lows. (See: the biggest disappointments of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.) We posted the best surprises of 2018 yesterday, so now it’s time for failures, mistakes and outright disasters. It’s that time again: time to take stock of the year that was 2018. We’ll start with the nice… Fans were skeptical when Fallout 76 was announced at this year’s E3, but many were willing to give it a shot. It was a new kind of Fallout, one in a collaborative world, where players would be able to build bases like in Fallout 4, work together, or nuke each other. It was a risk—and it didn’t pay off. The game launched with extravagant bugs, a lifeless world, and unsatisfying multiplayer. As the bummer cherry on top, the $200 Power Armor edition of the game shipped with flimsy nylon bags instead of swagged out canvas ones. The lowest point, however, was when the support site bugged out and started revealing players’ personal information, including home addresses, to other players. Yikes. It was like time traveling to 2003: After a deadly mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, Trump met with video game executives and watched a reel of violent video game clips. While it was amusing that Giant Bomb’s Dan Ryckert somehow ended up on that video, the idea of the President of the United States entertaining the idea that the severity and frequency of mass shootings in this country might be caused by violent video games is ridiculous. It simply is not true, and only acts to serve as a distraction from the real legislative problems in this country that make such shootings so tragically commonplace. The point of an underdog story is that they might, at some point, catch a break. Not so for the Shanghai Dragons, who ended the season with 0-40 record. Zero for forty. They played forty games, and did not win a single one of them.They may hold a special place in my players’ hearts for signing Geguri, the first woman in the Overwatch league, but new signings weren’t enough to turn their luck around. Fortnite is one of the most popular video games in the world at this point, which makes it all the more unfortunate how poor a job Epic has done securing players’ accounts. They get hacked all the time, and some players have had their credit card information compromised as a result. There’s actually a thriving economy based off of hacking and then selling accounts, and one hacker told Kotaku that Epic’s account security is “top kek.” What has Epic done about this? Not too much, it appears. If your kid is using your credit card to buy a Season Pass for Fortnite, keep an eye out for any weird transactions. Tumblr was a great way to artists who like to draw boobs to keep a portfolio, make announcements to their audience, and engage in a thriving artistic community. On December 17th, those artists will have to look for a new internet home. After years of problems with pornbots posting spam and other users posting child pornography, Tumblr banned all adult content. While getting rid of the aforementioned issues is good for the site, it’s also a move that people who use Tumblr find way too extreme. On top of that, Tumblr’s algorithm for finding and flagging adult content is hilariously busted. With competitors like Pillowfort and Are.na breathing down Tumblr’s neck, the site may be done for. In 2004 a trio of ex-LucasArts employees banded together to revitalize the adventure game genre. The studio they founded, Telltale Games, spent 14 years creating episodic adventures based on beloved properties like Batman, Sam & Max, The Guardians of the Galaxy, Game of Thrones and in the company’s most popular series, The Walking Dead. Then, in September of 2018, citing poor game sales, the company laid off all but 25 of its employees and began the process of shutting down. Employees were caught off-guard by the closure, with many hard at work on the ongoing Walking Dead series late into the night prior to layoffs. Staff was let go with no warning and provided no severance. The entire situation was dreadful. Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman’s Skybound Entertainment worked out a deal to bring on some former employees to complete the final two episodes of  The Walking Dead’s final season, but that does little to soften such a harsh end for a beloved, prolific studio. Following Nintendo’s two successful forays into the retro console market, Sony surprised us all with the announcement of the $100 PlayStation Classic. Like Nintendo’s offerings, the PlayStation Classic would be loaded with 20 of the best games the original console had to offer. Unlike Nintendo, however, Sony’s idea of what constitutes the best games their console had to offer differed greatly from what many fans had in mind. Dreams of a dedicated Suikoden II machine were dashed when Sony revealed the full game list. No Gran Turismo? No Wipeout? No Star Wars: Masters of Teras-Kasi? We were bummed. Bummed enough for a podcast episode about it. And when it came time to review the finished product, we found it lacked passion.  But hey, you know who has passion? The hackers who’ve already got other games running on the PlayStation Classic. It’s a labor of love for them. Hey kids, here’s a tip. If you are going to get into a growing, high-profile activity like esports or plan on making your living streaming in public, maybe check the racist, homophobic, transphobic and misogynistic comments at the door. You know, like good people. If you’re super-popular streamer Ninja, don’t rap the n-word. In fact, don’t use that word at all, no matter who you are. Don’t type “faggot” into your team chat. While we’re at it, don’t suggest people kill themselves. See those links? Each one leads to someone being at best thoughtlessly cruel, at worst purposefully so, and we reported on far more similar incidents in 2018. There’s enough of that bullshit in the world at large. We don’t need it in gaming. Yesterday we celebrated the inclusion of Samus Aran’s archenemy, Ridley, in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Today, we lament the exclusion of Luigi’s archnemesis, Waluigi. Why does Nintendo treat the purple-clad, red-nosed evil version of Mario’s brother so horribly? Why does Wario get on the Smash Bros. roster while showing his ass crack and passing gas, while Waluigi keeps his pants on and gets excluded? Is it because Waluigi is horrible, or because he’s really fucking horrible? The world may never know. I’m all for broad inclusion in topical discussions, but how exactly is Tumblr banning fucking and thus fucking itself a “video game” disappointment? Disappointing, sure, and still a fresh wound for many, but where’s the connection?",2018-12-19 11:00:00,The Biggest Video Game Disappointments of 2018,,4469,http://gizmodo.com
270,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/588247246/0/phoenix/nation~Former-Blackwater-guard-convicted-of-instigating-mass-shooting-in-Iraq/,"WASHINGTON – A former Blackwater Worldwide security guard has been convicted a second time on a charge that he instigated a mass shooting in Iraq more than a decade ago. A federal jury convicted Nick Slatten of Sparta, Tennessee, on Wednesday of first-degree murder for his role in a deadly shooting rampage that killed 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians and wounded 17 others. It was the third time Slatten had stood trial on the charge. Jurors deliberated for four days before returning their verdict, which came at the close of a six-week trial in U.S. District Court in Washington – and just three months after a previous trial on the same charge ended in a hung jury. Slatten's family called the verdict ""a devastating blow."" ""We are confident that the erroneous legal rulings that deprived Nick of a fair trial and resulted in his wrongful conviction will be corrected,"" said his sister, Jessica Slatten. ""Nick is innocent, and we will never stop fighting to bring him home."" Slatten, 35, remains incarcerated pending sentencing by U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth. No sentencing date has been set. The murder charge calls for a mandatory sentence of life in prison. During the trial, prosecutors presented testimony from 34 witnesses, including four who traveled from Iraq to testify. Slatten disputed the government's arguments that he fired the opening shot that touched off the rampage, which became one of the flashpoints in the war between Iraq and a U.S.-led coalition. Another guard, Paul Slough of Keller, Texas, said on multiple occasions that he fired the opening shot, not Slatten. Eyewitnesses also pointed to Slough as the initial shooter. But prosecutors countered that Slough’s statements had been inconsistent. He initially denied to investigators that he had opened fire, then later recanted and claimed he fired the first shots, they said. During his first trial, Slatten was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2014 for his role in the shooting. A federal appeals court threw out Slatten's conviction last year and ordered that he receive a new trial because he had not been allowed to introduce evidence that Slough fired the first shots. The government’s case hinged on the allegation that Slatten was the initial shooter, the appeals court said. At his second trial, prosecutors argued that Slatten and other guards opened fire without provocation on innocent Iraqis and used excessive force. Slatten, prosecutors contended, fired the first shots, killing a young, unarmed Iraqi medical student. That trial ended in a hung jury in September when jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict after 16 days of deliberations. The deadly rampage in which Slatten was charged happened in 2007 in Baghdad’s Nisour Square and already has been the subject of investigations by the military, a congressional panel, the FBI and others. But details of what happened remain in dispute. Slatten and three other guards – Slough, Dustin Heard of Maryville, Tennessee, and Evan Liberty of Rochester, New Hampshire – were all former armed services members working as private security guards for Blackwater, now known as Academi. The guards’ Raven 23 security team was under contract by the State Department. On Sept. 16, 2007, their convoy traveled to a crowded traffic circle in downtown Baghdad as part of the effort to evacuate a U.S. diplomat. At some point, the guards opened fire with machine guns and grenade launchers. They say the shooting started only after a white Kia sedan driven by the Iraqi medical student lurched out of stopped traffic and approached their four armored vehicles. The men had received intelligence reports that a white Kia might be used as a car bomb, so they feared they were under attack. The unarmed driver, Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia’y, was one of the 14 civilians killed in the attack. No evidence of a bomb was ever found.

Employers stuck to their guns instead of being bullied by a social media mob,"" media critic Joe Concha says Getty Images; TBS Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has lost at least 20 advertisers over remarks last Thursday that immigration has made the United States ""poorer and dirtier and more divided,"" is just the latest target of a tactic that has come to define media in 2018: the coordinated sponsor boycott. While the number of advertiser boycotts has escalated this year -- with stars ranging from Carlson's Fox News colleagues Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity to TBS' Samantha Bee singled out by opponents -- networks and sponsors alike have been able to ride out the wave of bad publicity without any lasting damage to either viewership or the bottom line. ""Overall, none this year were successful,"" TheHill Media critic Joe Concha told TheWrap. ""Employers stuck to their guns instead of being bullied by a social media mob with an agenda to get certain voices taken off the field permanently."" Also Read: Tucker Carlson Dropped by at Least 20 Advertisers Over Immigration Comments Also Read: Tucker Carlson Dropped by at Least 20 Advertisers Over Immigration Comments That didn't stop activists, watchdog groups and even one precocious teenager from taking aggressive swings at networks, on-air talent and others with public campaigns against the companies who financially support them. The move to pressure sponsors to effect change in media is nothing new -- after all, it was an advertiser-led boycott, coupled with bad publicity from multiple accusations of sexual harassment, that helped drive Bill O'Reilly from Fox News last year. Fox News, with its partisan firebrands perennially atop cable news ratings, received the brunt of the most serious sponsor boycotts this year. In addition to Carlson's current imbroglio, there was one directed at Sean Hannity, stemming from a 2017 show in which he questioned the motives of women accusing Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct. Another was launched by Parkland, Fla., mass-shooting survivor David Hogg against Laura Ingraham after she mocked the teenager on Twitter. But as 2018 comes to a close, both primetime hosts remain on the air, with their ratings undiminished. ""The Ingraham Angle"" actually saw its ratings improve after the boycott, with the six weeks after rising in both overall viewers and in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 year-old demographic. Ingraham netted an average of 2.656 million viewers nightly, with roughly 553,000 of those coming from the key demo. And they've held firm since, coming in at 2.7 million total viewers and 514,000 in the demo for the fourth quarter of 2018.

However, Fox News has taken a hit in booking ad time on its primetime shows, and Ingraham in particular continues to struggle to win back sponsors even as she has maintained her viewership. ""Laura Ingraham seems to have had a less favorable outcome and ad time in her show is still lighter than before the boycott,"" Kantar Media's chief research officer Jon Swallen told TheWrap, Also Read: David Hogg Boycotts Against Vanguard and BlackRock Fall Flat So Far Also Read: David Hogg Boycotts Against Vanguard and BlackRock Fall Flat So Far Prior to the Hogg-led boycott in March, ""The Ingraham Angle"" had around 15 minutes of commercial time, according to data from Kantar Media. That number plummeted as advertisers including Bayer, Hulu, Johnson & Johnson, Liberty Mutual, and Wayfair fled the program, leaving it with between 6 and 7 minutes in the ensuing weeks. Though Ingraham has recovered a bit, it's still lower than the pre-boycott levels, clocking in just over nine minutes over the last four weeks, according to Kantar data. The sponsor boycott against Hannity, on the other hand, has had only a ""fleeting"" effect, Swallen said. His show's ad sales have returned to pre-boycott levels, he said, ""If not to boycotting advertisers themselves, then to willing replacements."" Also Read: Fox News' Laura Ingraham Just Had Her Highest-Rated Month Ever Also Read: Fox News' Laura Ingraham Just Had Her Highest-Rated Month Ever In a statement to TheWrap, Fox News ad sales president Marianne Gambelli vowed the network would never bow to ""agenda-driven intimidation efforts"" and vigorously defended Ingraham and her show. ""We are fully supportive of 'The Ingraham Angle' and are very comfortable with her commercial load. Laura is on track to finish 2018 as a top five rated program in cable news and has one of the most valuable and loyal audiences in the industry, which remains our number one objective,"" she said. ""We will not allow voices like hers to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts by the political operatives at Media Matters who continue to turn a blind eye to every television network but Fox News since it's the only outlet that doesn't subscribe to their extreme left-wing agenda."" She added, ""We expect [Ingraham's] program to return to a regular load next cycle."" Also Read: Migrant Caravan Coverage Plummeted After Midterms (Exclusive) Also Read: Migrant Caravan Coverage Plummeted After Midterms (Exclusive) While Hogg and many others have targeted Fox News over the years, they have been aided by organized pressure groups who bring years of institutional knowledge to the fight. Media Matters for America has been pressuring advertisers to drop Fox News since its campaign against Glenn Beck's breakout program in 2009. MMFA chief Angelo Carusone was bullish about the prospects of future campaigns and insisted that boycotts have had a subtle but profound systemic effects within Fox News itself. ""We've seen faster responses by Fox, either with terminating people (like they did when a contributor called [Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey] Ford a 'slut') or by simply reacting to criticism and apologizing,"" Carusone told TheWrap via direct message. ""Next year, the pressure will intensify,"" he said. ""Fox will either change and improve or they'll start to face litigation from shareholders for incinerating cash in order to advance a political agenda."" Also Read: Samantha Bee Launches Production Company, Signs First-Look Deal With TBS Also Read: Samantha Bee Launches Production Company, Signs First-Look Deal With TBS In 2018, righteous indignation crossed the party lines as well, with conservatives taking a page out of the liberal playbook to go after TBS' weekly satirical show ""Full Frontal With Samantha Bee"" after its left-leaning host called First Daughter Ivanka Trump a ""feckless c---"" during an episode in May (she soon apologized for her ""inappropriate and inexcusable"" remark). ""If you're a conservative who whines and complains every time leftists boycott and destroy conservatives but then you refuse to call for boycotts of leftists... you are the problem,"" thundered Daily Wire reporter Ryan Saavedra, who helped lead the charge against Bee. ""Either fight fire with fire or quit complaining when one side plays to win and you don't."" Brands like Autotrader, State Farm and others dropped out as sponsors and for about two weeks, the show's commercial airtime was mostly filled with promos for other Turner content. The campaign spooked TBS executives, who promised more oversight over the show. But within three weeks, ""Full Frontal"" was back at its typical ad load, though at least one targeted sponsor, State Farm, told TheWrap it planned to remain off the program. Reps for TBS declined to comment. On the ratings front, however, Bee's choice of words had no material effect either way -- save for a brief viewership bump in the weeks immediately after the firestorm. ""Full Frontal"" consistently draws between 800,000 and 900,000 viewers, according to Nielsen, including 897,000 for a Dec. 5 episode.

The campaign has employed armies of volunteers to take screenshots of on-page ads appearing on Breitbart and then alert corporate leadership -- which is often unaware of where online-ad placement giants like Google and Facebook place their promotional spots. Since the campaign began shining a light, literally thousands of companies have moved to disassociate their ads from the website. ""Sleeping Giants was really started as a reaction to the inflammatory rhetoric aimed at women, minorities and immigrants on Breitbart which, it turns out, was being funded unknowingly by advertisers because of complicated internet advertising programs run by companies like Google and Facebook,"" the campaign told TheWrap. ""It has resulted in over 4,060 advertisers removing themselves from the site."" It's unclear the extent of the impact on Breitbart, thought the company did threaten Rivitz with legal action in October with a stern lawyer's letter from the firm Clare Locke. ""Sleeping Giants is not a boycott. It is a harassment effort directed against businesses by a politically motivated organization of activists who have received a litigation warning letter from us for their illicit activities,"" a Breitbart spokesperson told TheWrap ""We intend to vigorously continue debunking and pursuing our claims against them in 2019."" And more likely than not, advertisers will continue to feel the heat from advocacy groups. 9 Times New York Times Editorial Made Everyone Freak Out

But that’s the picture being painted at El Chapo’s ongoing federal drug conspiracy trial in New York. Are the Trump administration’s bump stock ban and that bipartisan prison sentencing reform measure he favors an indicator of a new Congress or just a momentary holiday blip? And Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle has dropped her challenge against state Comptroller Susana Mendoza’s nominating petitions, clearing the way for Mendoza to get on the Feb. 26 mayoral ballot. Welcome to The Spin. For years, city activists would show up at mayoral press conferences to share what were widely viewed as conspiracy theories. One went this way: Law enforcement either doesn’t know or doesn’t care about middle-of-the-night shipments of illicit drugs being ferried into the city via train and other modes of transportation. They suggested part of the pipeline ran through the 11th Ward — a knock at then-Mayor Richard M. Daley and his family’s geographical center of power in the city. That’s never been proven, but testimony this week offered by lieutenants of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman — on trial in a drug conspiracy case playing out in New York — suggests the troublemakers may have been on to something. Not the 11th Ward part. But as the Tribune’s Jeff Coen reports: In untold hundreds of truck and train shipments, tons of cocaine rolled into Chicago hidden among loads of vegetables, shrimp and even live sheep. The city acted as the American distribution center of the vast network of the Sinaloa cartel, a hub run by Chicago twin brothers who worked for “El Chapo.” One of the twins, who by now have turned on their boss, began testifying against him this week.

Chicago police normally alert Metra when commuter trains need to be stopped for any officer-involved activity, but the agency received no such notification Monday evening before two Chicago police officers were killed by a South Shore line train as they were searching for a gunman, officials said. In police work, things can unfold lightning fast and there isn’t always time for law enforcement to notify rail companies. The Chicago Police Department has no policy specifically governing foot pursuits by officers and no official rules about when an officer should or should not chase a suspect onto active train tracks, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. A proposed court order that would govern a sweeping overhaul of the troubled department’s practices calls on the agency to track foot pursuits and give officers further training on the chases that might make them safer. Guglielmi praised the officers for putting “the safety of that community above their own” as they pursued a shooting suspect. Read the latest on the case here, and details about the officers’ upcoming funerals here. From the Tribune’s Angie Leventis Lourgos: lllinois has declined in population for the fifth year in a row, losing an estimated 45,116 residents in 2018, according to the latest census data released Wednesday.

In March, the Tribune’s Elvia Malagon noted the political implications of the population drop, including losing a congressional seat. Read more here. Many Chicago-area federal workers could find themselves furloughed or working unpaid if Congress and President Donald Trump are unable to compromise before midnight Friday and avert a partial government shutdown, the Tribune’s Mike Riopell and Morgan Greene are reporting.

The move puts him at odds with the National Rifle Association, which spent millions, as The New York Times reported, on ads knocking Hillary Clinton and boosting Trump in the runup to the 2016 election. Later Tuesday night, the Senate — in a rare bipartisan act — approved a prison reform bill that would give judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders and boosting prisoner rehabilitation efforts, according to The Associated Press. It also would reduce the life sentences for some drug offenders with three convictions, or “three strikes,” to 25 years, according to the AP. The changes would only apply to federal prisoners. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., lead the charge on the prison reform measure, offering in a prepared statement: “It was supported by an amazing coalition of unlikely partners — progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans, law enforcement groups and civil rights groups, business leaders and faith-based organizations. By passing this legislation, we will now begin to relieve our overcrowded prisons, redirect funding to our most pressing crime prevention efforts, make our communities safer, and ensure the integrity of our justice system.” Read more here. The measure is expected to clear the House and then head to Trump for his consideration. Taking the temperature via Twitter, it looks like Trump has his pen poised. “America is the greatest Country in the world and my job is to fight for ALL citizens, even those who have made mistakes. Congratulations to the Senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic Criminal Justice Reform Bill....” the president’s Twitter account offered Tuesday night. And in a second tweet: “....This will keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance, to those who earn it. In addition to everything else, billions of dollars will be saved. I look forward to signing this into law!” It’s no secret that the Ricketts family publicly toyed with the idea of pulling up stakes and moving the team to the suburbs after long and contentious negotiations over taxpayer subsidies for renovating Wrigley Field. The Tribune and other outlets reported about it in 2013 — the Rosemont Cubs! But in newly published emails dating back to that time, Todd Ricketts, at one time the president’s pick to serve as deputy commerce secretary, pressed the idea internally with the family. Read Paul Sullivan’s Tribune column here. Dennis Culloton, Ricketts family spokesman, says the “stolen” emails show the negotiations became “heated” but “we saved Wrigley Field and in the process put more than 1,000 union men and women to work … and the neighborhood his better.” Asked what the relationship is like between the Ricketts family and Mayor Rahm Emanuel today, Culloton said: “It was a difficult process, but it worked out.” Mayoral spokeswoman Shannon Breymaier said almost the same thing in an emailed statement. “The Mayor told the Ricketts family the same thing he told the owners of the Hawks and the Bulls — you own it, you pay for it. Negotiations can sometimes be heated, but the end result here was good for both the city and the Cubs.” Preckwinkle drops challenge against Mendoza: Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle will drop her challenge to state Comptroller Susana Mendoza’s mayoral petitions, clearing the way for Mendoza to appear as a candidate on the February ballot, the Tribune’s John Byrne reports. The petition fight between two women who are considered mayoral front-runners has been a central focus of the past few weeks of the race. Read here. More money: Bill Daley topped the $3 million mark in fundraising and extended his financial advantage in the Chicago mayoral race, thanks to a round of checks that included support from a member of the Kennedy clan, the Tribune’s Bill Ruthhart reported. Read here. And Willie Wilson, another of the 21 candidates in the race, just gave himself another $150,000. State AG: Clergy sex abuse worse than reported: A scathing report from Attorney General Lisa Madigan finds the number of Catholic clergy accused of sexual abuse in Illinois is much higher than previously acknowledged, with 690 clergy accused, although Catholic officials have publicly identified only 185 clergy with credible allegations against them.

D.C. attorney general sues Facebook: The lawsuit marks the first major effort by regulators in the United States to penalize the tech giant for its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy. Facebook allowed the firm to gain access to the names, “likes” and other personal data about tens of millions of the social site’s users without their permission, authorities say.

277,https://hotair.com/archives/2018/12/20/suspects-murder-scandinavian-tourists-believed-connections-isis/,"Two Scandinavian tourists on a vacation in Morocco were brutally murdered by a group of men whom authorities suspect are connected to ISIS. From Fox News: Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, were murdered while camping in the Atlas mountains. The women were found in and outside their tent, located about two hours walking distance from the village of Imlil. One of the women had been decapitated. The killers are understood to have filmed the double slaying and a video is circulating on Moroccan social media, according to Morocco World News. The Guardian reports that Danish intelligence is investigating the video as Moroccan authorities arrested three men believed to be involved: The Danish intelligence service, the PET, at first said it had authenticated the video but later rowed back, saying it was still being “examined”. The latest statement came as Moroccan authorities arrested three more suspects over the killings in the Atlas mountains, which have sent shockwaves through a popular tourist destination that has been relatively untouched by Islamist attacks. The Moroccan government spokesman, Mustapha El Khalfi, described the killings as a “criminal and terrorist act”… The men were seized with three long machete-like knives, a shorter blade, a slingshot and several mobile phones. Another suspect arrested in Marrakech on Tuesday had affiliations to an extremist group, Moroccan authorities said, and had apparently identified the others involved… In the videos that have been circulating, a voice can reportedly be heard speaking of the “enemies of Allah” several times and referring to “revenge for our brothers in Hajin”, referring to the last stronghold of Isis in Syria, which fell a few days ago. Local news reports suggest the killers camped near where the two women were camping in the Atlas mountains and then fled immediately after the attack. The women’s bodies were found by a pair of French women hiking nearby. This attack comes just about a week after the Christmas market mass shooting in Strasbourg by a man who was apparently inspired by ISIS. And just this week I wrote about a 23-year-old ISIS sympathizer here in the U.S. who was allegedly planning attacks and/or wildfires in California. And Ed wrote about a foiled plot against the Vatican which had been planned by ISIS. All of that to says, ISIS may be mostly gone in Syria but they clearly still have the ability to inspire attacks around the world. Update: Photos of the three suspects who have been arrested. https://twitter.com/bdnews24/status/1075764034417217538 The Daily Mail is reporting that video of four men pledging allegiance to ISIS has been found separate from the video of the attack.

278,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/12/bump-stocks-matthew-whitaker-attorney-general-appointment-illegal.html,"On Tuesday, the Department of Justice issued its final rule banning “bump stocks”—accessories that allow semi-automatic rifles to fire like fully automated rifles—throughout the country. That same day, a group of Second Amendment organizations filed a lawsuit challenging the rule’s legality. The plaintiffs raised a number of predictable claims, alleging that the policy exceeds the executive branch’s authority and infringes upon the right to bear arms. But their first and central argument is a direct attack on Trump’s DOJ: They argue that acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker was appointed illegally, rendering the bump stock ban that Whitaker authorized null and void. President Donald Trump has pushed a bump stock ban since the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, when a shooter used bump stocks to kill 58 people and injure more than 400 in the most deadly modern mass shooting in U.S. history. Under President Barack Obama, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives twice found that bump stocks could not be regulated under a federal law that bans machine guns, since they contain no moving parts. Trump ordered the attorney general—at the time, Jeff Sessions—to reconsider this conclusion. Now the Justice Department has amended federal regulations to clarify that bump stocks do, indeed, fall within the federal definition of a machine gun, and are therefore illegal. Under federal law, a machine gun is “any weapon which shoots … automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.” Any part designed “for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun” is also prohibited. The DOJ held that bump stocks fall within this definition because they  “allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.” In short, they allow rifles to function like machine guns—precisely what the law forbids. Owners of these accessories have 90 days from Tuesday to surrender or destroy them. Gun rights activists insist that bump stocks don’t fall under the federal ban within the text of the law because they do not allow a firearm to fire more than one shot “by a single function of the trigger.” Rather, these devices harness a rifle’s recoil energy to make the trigger automatically re-engage (or “bump”) against the shooter’s finger. So a shooter need only pull the trigger once to fire multiple rounds—but the trigger itself will automatically re-engage to keep shooting. The dispute here, then, is whether “a single function of the trigger” can be reasonably interpreted as a single pull of the trigger. That’s a tricky question. Because law is ambiguous—it does not define “function”—the courts are probably obligated to defer to the DOJ’s interpretation, which is certainly plausible. In their lawsuit, however, the Civil Rights Defense Firm, the Madison Society Foundation, and the Firearms Policy Coalition and Foundation argue that it is “arbitrary and capricious,” a botched reading of the relevant statute. They also make a range of constitutional claims, alleging that the rule violates the Second Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Ex Post Facto Clause, and the Contracts Clause. These constitutional claims are frivolous and will be waved away by the courts. The government is allowed to criminalize accessories that allow a shooter to slaughter hundreds of people in a matter of minutes; its machine gun ban has been upheld by the courts. The government can ban and seize a dangerous item without compensating the owner. And it can outlaw weapons without a grandfather clause that allows current owners to keep their devices. But the plaintiffs’ case against Whitaker cannot be so easily dismissed. They argue—correctly, in my view and the view of many legal scholars—that the federal statute that controls succession at the DOJ does not permit Trump to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general. (If the law did allow Trump to elevate Whitaker without Senate confirmation, it would likely be unconstitutional.) Instead, this statute clarifies that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should be considered the acting attorney general. Accordingly, the plaintiffs write, “Whitaker is unable to lawfully perform the duties and responsibilities of Attorney General” and “lacks the authority to sign the Final Rule as Attorney General.” As a result, “the Final Rule must be struck down as invalidly enacted.” This argument is not wrong—although if a court agreed, the solution would be simple: have Rosenstein sign the rule. Still, this attack on the acting attorney general’s authority illustrates what an unforced error the Whitaker appointment was. A bunch of plaintiffs, from senators to asylum-seekers, have already challenged Whitaker’s authority. Now even gun rights groups, a longstanding ally of the president, are exploiting his legally dubious elevation in court. As long as he remains the ostensible head of the Justice Department, plaintiffs will seize upon his shaky claim of authority to pursue their goals. (Notably, the National Rifle Association did not file suit against the bump stock ban; perhaps the group was hesitant to buck the president in whom it is so heavily invested.) Whitaker—who, the Washington Post reported Thursday, will not recuse himself from overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, overruling the counsel of ethics officials—may not be in this tenuous position much longer. Trump has nominated William Barr to replace him, and Barr’s confirmation would end the uncertainty over who, legally, is in charge of the DOJ. Until then, expect the barrage of lawsuits over Whitaker to continue, even from conservatives who might find themselves irked by any given new Trump policy.

This was the year when countless dystopian “what if”s came true. What if Donald Trump is amoral enough to lock kids in cages? (He is.) What if mobile apps are tracking your physical movement? (They are.) What if the school shooting epidemic is getting progressively worse? (It is.) What if the QAnon crazies never log off? (They won’t.) What if you’re the only one who didn’t like A Star Is Born? (Oh boy.) As we wind down this year and prepare for 2019 — with a market crash looming and an ugly new presidential election already rearing its head — we’re taking a look back at 20 things that caused us palpable anxiety over the past 12 months. Maybe getting it out of our system will help? See Also

						Singer Paulette McWilliams on Her Years With Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, and Steely Dan Being sucked out of airplanes at 30,000 feetBefore 2018, commercial air travel nightmares were frequently all-or-nothing disasters. Either everybody dies in a fiery wreck or you all survive the turbulence and grumble. But in the spring of 2018, the horror of getting sucked out of a plane mid-air manifested itself twice. On a Southwest flight in April, a woman died tragically after shrapnel from a failing engine shattered her window, causing cabin pressure to plummet, oxygen masks to drop and, as several reports described the incident, “sucking her out” as far as her waist. The passenger next to her pulled her back in, but she died from her injuries. A month later, a co-pilot on China’s Sichuan Airlines survived after being “sucked halfway out” of the cockpit when a windshield blew out.  —Andrea Marks  Photo credit: CNP/REX/Shutterstock CNP/REX/Shutterstock Brett Kavanaugh’s face during the confirmation hearingsIf an eight-year-old boy spoke to you the way Brett Kavanaugh spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 27th, you wouldn’t let him decide what to eat for dessert, much less what women can do with their bodies, whether voting districts can be redrawn or who can and can’t enter the United States. After the dignified, harrowing and devastatingly polite testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused Kavanaugh of attempting to sexually assault her in high school, President Trump’s latest Supreme Court nominee took the mic looking like a sentient angry emoji. He narrowed his eyes and crinkled his nose and pursed his lips so tightly they nearly disappeared from his face. He spat his words. He gulped down water (perhaps wishing it were beer?) to keep himself from crying. He proudly declared of his opening statement, “I wrote it myself,” as if he were holding up a macaroni-art portrait of grandma. Brett Kavanaugh, sniveling coward, is now a Supreme Court Justice. I think of his face that day — so full of rage and fear — firm in the knowledge that it lurks behind the civilized mask so many powerful men wear in public. The notion is as frightening as it is depressing. But it is also something of a gift. Entitlement has never looked so ugly. Power has never looked so fragile. —Maria Fontoura Here come the deepfakesIf you’re sleeping too well these days, it’s because the word “deepfake” — the concept of superimposing and doctoring artificial images and sounds over actual video footage — hasn’t yet reached the mainstream. That’s about to change. What started as a new way for exceptionally horny guys to place a celebrity’s face over a porn star’s body made its way to the White House in November, when press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders posted a doctored video of CNN reporter Jim Acosta’s interaction with President Trump to make his harmless microphone joust with an intern appear more menacing than it was. Regardless of your political persuasion, deepfakes may be the next frontier of cleaving the populace and creating alternate realities based on (mis)perception. (Did your favorite candidate or hated political enemy really say that just because it looks and sounds like they did?) Video used to be the great “I don’t believe it unless I see it” equalizer we all could agreed on; not anymore. —Jason Newman  Twitter’s inexplicably adorable icon accompaniment to the #MeToo hashtagSeriously, the only thing worse than an unrelenting news cycle of harassment, misconduct and deception might just be a cutesified pink avatar of it. —Amy X. Wang Mass shooting live streams from inside the schoolsThe haunting black-and-white surveillance footage of the two killers stalking about Columbine High School in 1999 doesn’t hold a candle to what we saw broadcast live on Valentine’s Day of this year. The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre unfolded live via social media, complete with captions like “Omg nooo” and “Our fucking school is getting shot up.” Seeing a mass shooting through the eyes of children provided a sickening, yet necessary virtual reality experience for a culture intoxicated by guns and their power. The student survivors went on to create a movement that has the NRA on its heels, but perhaps nothing was more important than the citizen journalists behind those phones, having the presence of mind to show us what could have been their very last moments. —Jamil Smith Photo credit: Wong Maye-E/AP/REX/Shutterstock Wong Maye-E/AP/REX/Shutterstock Literally just trying to get to work on the subwayIt’s one of the finest public transit systems on earth, operating 24 hours per day across nearly 700 miles of track for a democratizing flat rate that will take you from the Bronx to Brighton Beach. But in 2018, the New York City subway devolved into a post-apocalyptic hellscape. Trains reached their destinations a pathetic 66 percent of the time due to recurring signal malfunctions, “traffic,” flooding, fires and accidentally activated brakes. Things fall apart; the MTA cannot hold — but the thing is … it could. All it would take is for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to fully assume responsibility for the crippling decay and allocate the necessary funds for full modernization. You may recall the arrival of new MTA president Andy Byford via fawning profiles by 60 Minutes and the New Yorker, complete with accounts of the optimistic problem-solver picking up trash with his bare hands. But the daily commute for some 5 million people remains a primal source of anxiety, leaving riders late for flights, job interviews, medical appointments, jury duty, parole hearings. All the while, Cuomo smiles on, having coasted to reelection, occasionally donning an embroidered jacket to hop down on the tracks for a photo-op. That is, when he’s not diverting money away from the subway to subsidize upstate ski resorts. —John Hendrickson  Is climate change to blame for our declining mental health?While anyone who believes in basic environmental science was rightfully horrified by this year’s climate reporting, much of the information wasn’t really anything new. People tend to push these thoughts toward the back of their mind — Donald Trump is the president, fascism is on the rise — but psychic numbing failed us and people finally felt the direness of the ecological situation this year. Yet climate change, as the military argues, is merely a “threat multiplier” looming over other environmental crises like the sixth mass extinction, which scientists have noted can be just as bad for the planet as global warming. Few have contemplated the effects of this on our mental health. Our minds and language developed while living in reciprocity with the natural world in order to assist with taxonomic needs of hunter-gatherer cultures — properly butchering kills, identifying plants and even providing a mnemonic map of the wilderness, as in the Dreamtime songlines of the Australian Aborigines. As we continue to obliterate the more-than-human world, we are quite possibly destroying the basis of human intelligence itself. As the ecological philosopher David Abram has so eloquently put it: “We are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human.” Sadly, we still have the Internet. —Rick Carp Are we going to hell for using plastic straws?I drink a lot of iced coffee, which involves the use of a plastic straw 100 percent of the time. This year we were reminded that these straws are too small to recycle and that we should probably be making some sort of effort to stop using them so much. This hasn’t really happened. I don’t have room in my pockets for an aluminum eco-tube in a beechwood case with a fancy pipe cleaner, a $28 alternative recently suggested by the New York Times. But now whenever I unsheathe a plastic straw and stab it through my coffee lid, I feel a slight pang of guilt. How many straws have I used in my life? Hundreds? Thousands? Enough to fill a bathtub? Is a bathtub worth of my straws floating in the middle of the north Atlantic right now? Maybe a seal is dead because I’m an asshole who has to have his cold brew. This is troubling enough to give me about 30 seconds of low-frequency anxiety every morning, but not quite enough to turn me into the type of person who doesn’t leave the house without a reusable straw made of bamboo. Sea mammals, I’m sorry. Just know that I’m thinking of you. Maybe in 2019. —Ryan Bort  Photo credit: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/REX/Shutterstock Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/REX/Shutterstock Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson’s matching 9/11 tattoosLike you, I grew to not only love but genuinely root for Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson’s quick relationship-to-engagement turnaround. The more I saw posts of Davidson calling Grande his “spumoni princess,” or her thirst-commenting on his magazine profile portraits, the more I began to hope that this peak millennial-Gen Z cusp couple would spend the rest of their lives together. But the moment Grande got a tattoo to commemorate Davidson’s firefighter father who died in 9/11 gave me a serious dose of “ooh girl, slow down.” It’s a sweet gesture, in theory — Davidson’s dad’s badge number “8418” written in blink-and-you’ll-miss-it script on the top of her foot — and it matches the one Davidson already has on his forearm. Still, that type of permanent branding of your partner’s trauma so few months in still felt cringe-y, and of course they broke up a couple months later. Even so, the duo’s dedication to loving each other in the fullest, biggest, most public and extreme ways, if only for the summer and change, was a glimmer of hope this year and led to Grande’s best music of her career. —Brittany Spanos That OTHER breakupIt started with a DM slide, and ended by going Instagram Live. SoundCloud face-tatted rapper Lil Xan’s public breakup with Miley Cyrus’ little sister, Noah, took me on an emotional roller coaster. Because, really, when you read the headline “Lil Xan Denies He Broke up with Noah Cyrus Over Charlie Puth” it’s all downhill from there. First, you scan Noah’s agram. Watch her story. Read her tweets. Then, frantically, before anything can be deleted, you hop on over to Xan’s social media. Maybe even check a few fan accounts. You’re piecing together all the clues, screenshots, comments, deleted photos, like you’re Mark Ruffalo solving the Zodiac case. Noah says,“I’m heartbroken and confused. This is the meme I sent Diego that made him think I’m cheating.” Xan says “If y’all think that meme is the reason I broke up with Noah, that is hilarious.” What is the truth? Hours of social media detective work left me with no answers. Only a cramp in my scrolling hand, a dying phone and, a few days later, the official music video for their single “Live or Die.” —Daniela Tijerina  Does George R.R. Martin have pages?For the past year, when I think about George RR Martin never completing his opus, A Song of Fire and Ice, I’m nearly overcome with disappointment and a creeping frustration. Like millions of fans, I’ve spent countless hours with the books and have devotedly watched Game of Thrones on HBO. When, during the last two seasons, the show forged ahead and the decidedly non-Martin writers changed crucial plot points, I wondered how the two competing narratives could reconcile, especially at the conclusion. Nevertheless, I stayed loyal. But now the horror has set in: GOT will end next year and the remaining two books still have no set publication date. What if the endings are completely different? What if one, or both, are massive let-downs? There are millions of us out there worrying about a slightly overweight 70-year old man and his writing habits. Is he truly committed to this cause? Why would he publish a massive history of Westeros before finishing the damn series? Years ago, when fans first began to complain about Martin’s glacial pace, the author Neil Gaiman famously said to the enraged obsessives, “George RR Martin is not your bitch.” Fair enough. But I’ve stared at the family trees of the royal families of Westeros, for longer than any sane adult should be willing to admit. My god, all those hours of my life and it may just fade to black. Or what if he just never finishes? —Sean Woods Photo credit: Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Did I waste years of my life being a Kanye fan?It’s not so much that Kanye West’s politics pivoted to “problematic” in 2018; it’s more that to call his empty provocations “politics” is giving them too much credit. Kanye spent the year spewing upsetting, incomprehensible things that honestly weren’t really worthy of our arguments against them, and it called into question how much time I’ve spent thinking about the Chicago rapper in my life. I’ve pored over his albums, drawn thematic links, read every interview. Was a guy who is arguing, opaquely, that slavery was a choice, really worth that time? I’m of the mind that meaning in art is up to the listener — whatever meaning you can wring out of a song, an album, a career is yours, regardless of the artist’s intent — so the time I spent engulfed in Kanye’s work was loosely the point; the journey not the destination, etc. But it gave me pause, this year, to think that back in 2003, I could have simply picked someone else to follow so closely, and I may have been better off doing so. —Brendan Klinkenberg  All those people who complain about “too much music”Anxiety is an inherent part of streaming. Musicians don’t get paid enough, algorithms are replacing tastemakers and playlists are giving rise to a homogenization of genre. Those claims are fair, but dwarfed when compared to the growing disdain for the entire reason for streaming’s existence. For years, listeners demanded the illusion of unending choice, while secretly craving the comfort of less. Now the rising complaints against the sheer mass of music match the number of songs uploaded to the ether every day. At some point, I refused to get mad. There’s an understated relief in knowing you can walk away. Listening,to 40-plus song albums meant to game streaming platforms? Nope. Wading through a rapper’s fourth cobbled-together mixtape of the year? I’m good, beloved. There isn’t more music than ever, just increasingly efficient ways to deliver horrible music non-stop. Respecting your time is an act of resistance, too. —Charles Holmes Why did I pay money to watch a pregnant woman step on a nail?Surprisingly, I was able to handle most of A Quiet Place, the post-apocalyptic horror film about a family battling sonic-hearing aliens. Since many of the film’s scenes are silent, watching it in a large, dark space was actually kind of a soothing exercise. The children play a tranquil game of Monopoly (before it catches on fire) and a bearded John Krasinski serenades his real-life wife, Emily Blunt, to Neil Young’s “Harvest Moon” (even though their youngest child just died). How relaxing! Then Blunt’s character Evelyn goes into labor and steps barefoot onto a loose nail. She stifles a scream with her hands, even though it’s too late: one of the monsters has already entered her home. Watching her lift her foot up from out of the nail so she can hide is the ultimate ripping-the-band-aid-off moment, and it almost made me walk out of the theater. —Angie Martoccio Gmail is definitely reading everythingAs part of an August redesign, Google finally acknowledged that its Gmail platform reads every single email you send and receive, introducing suggested responses that you can select with one click. Sometimes the responses are comically off-base, like suggesting you respond “Unfortunately, I can’t” to a long, detailed email full of instructions from your boss that just happens to start with the phrase “Can you…” but sometimes they’re creepily, annoyingly spot on. I refuse to use these suggested responses because I don’t want to help train an algorithm to replace me and speed up the inevitable AI takeover — and because I feel oddly defensive about the fact that I can type, “Great, thanks!” all by myself, thank you very much — but I still get a little shudder every time they guess right. —Lilly Dancyger  The blue light specialThere are days when the Trump presidency feels like one giant Pavlovian trial — and we’re the dogs. Pavlov used a bell to trigger his canine test subjects; for me, it’s the breaking news alert on my phone. Maybe it’s flashing to promote Mueller’s latest indictment of one of President Trump’s cronies. Maybe it wants me to stare at photos from the devastating Camp Fire in southern California. Inevitably, I receive this news on the small supercomputer in my pocket, and I know something awful is coming, because my darkened phone is blinking at me. A tiny, pinprick-sized blue light appears on a chipped and smudged black screen. An endorphin hit comes, then panic washes over me. Whatever I’m doing or thinking is immediately derailed. That blue dot has me trained better than any of Pavlov’s dogs. And it has me on a short leash. —Andy Kroll Salad kills you nowYou want to eat better. You really do. You order the salad version of your burrito instead of going into full bean-and-guac bonanza mode. And you wait in that stupid salad line at lunch rather than tip-toeing over to the pepperoni and buffalo chicken-anything zone. But E. coli shits on your diet decisions. Literally. In 2018, it seemed every time you thought it was safe to go green, there was another recall. Sure, it was mainly a California agricultural fiasco. But since the sediment of our Western agricultural reservoirs tested positive, according to the FDA — and it’s our state with the sixth largest economy on planet Earth (or maybe it’s now fifth? surpassing the United Kingdom’s GDP, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce) who is to blame — and California basically feeds us all right? So we dump the romaine, then the green and red leaf lettuces. But should we be composting this? And maybe it’s not really going to make us sick? Oh well, I guess sesame chicken and fried rice for dinner after all. I mean, they practically want us to vote with our stomachs right? —Jerry Portwood Photo credit: Seth Wenig/AP/REX/Shutterstock Seth Wenig/AP/REX/Shutterstock Do teens not realize Juul pods have nicotine?There was a moment a few years ago when it looked like decades of PSAs had finally snuffed out teen smoking. Then came Juul, a thumb-sized device that took vaping from nerdy subculture to mainstream fad. Teens love it — over the past year, as Juul has carved out 76 percent of the e-cigarette market; the number of high-school seniors who have tried vaping has gone up 78 percent. Juul’s flavored nicotine pods, offered in flavors like crème brulée and mango, take most of the blame — so convincing, after all, that a quarter of teen users thought they were just vaping flavors. No one seems to be more annoyed by the trend than Juul itself — its booming teen business has brought heat from the Surgeon General and the FDA. The company recently said in a statement that they are “committed to preventing youth access of JUUL products,” but at this point, it might be out of their hands. Sure, a convenient way to wean cigarette-addicted adults off nicotine seemed like a great idea. But what kind of wacky dystopian future is this where teens think it’s cool to suck on USB sticks? —Elisabeth Garber-Paul  Losing all your money right before ChristmasEven with all the uncertainty about world events increasingly festering in your long-beaten down brain, you and your 401(k) could always return to the safe skies of the longest bull run in stock market history. Until recently. In less than a month, the Dow has dropped more than 2,500 points, ushering in the second correction — a decline of 10 percent from its recent peak — of 2018 and headed for its worst December since the Great Depression. Great news for Counting Crows, who can license “A Long December” for crappy pharma ads treating your depression. Bad news for most people with money in the market. Silver lining: You’re not touching that 401(k) until retirement, so turn off CNBC, take a deep breath and eat something bad for you. But either way, go boring index funds and stop day trading. It’s stupid. —Jason Newman Photo credit: Evan Vucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock Evan Vucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock What if he gets away with it?Every expert said he had no chance in 2016. Every poll had him down. Now all the talking-head legal experts say he’s in real legal jeopardy. Sure, it looks bad: His lawyer flipped, there have been multiple indictments of confidants and more are coming. The Times ran a many-thousand-word expose on why his family empire is built on fraud. And we haven’t even seen the final Mueller report yet. But he has a network of millions worshiping at his altar. The senate and the house GOP barely mumble criticisms anymore. He’s likely the most corrupt executive in the country’s history. What if he gets reelected? What if everyone around him falls and he still stands, mocking his foes with cheap put-downs and exclamation points? What if he gets to play golf and eat fast food for the rest of his life? Will the country just shrug and move on? How can we forget these last few years and the horrific debasing of our highest office? He has abdicated his role as moral leader of the country and as a result we’ve all become untethered and adrift in an amoral universe where greed is good and the rotten rise to the top. What if he faces zero consequences? I just can’t shake the feeling that he’s going to walk out of the White House and go right back to the country club and there will be nothing but wreckage in his wake. —Sean Woods  In This Article:

Support trusted, factual information with a tax deductible contribution to PolitiFact. More Info Friends embrace in tears before the start of a community prayer vigil for Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting victims. (Eric Hasert/USA Today Network) Perhaps because of the recurrence of mass shootings, fact checks about guns top the list of the most-viewed 2018 fact checks at PolitiFactWisconsin.com. Indeed, gun-related checks claimed the first three spots. But the nation’s wealth gap, immigration, a Pants on Fire, a Kanye West claim and attacks on outgoing Gov. Scott Walker also drew many page views. Here’s a look at our 10 most-clicked. 1. ""In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1."" Our rating: Mostly False. This statement was made by television journalist and University of Wisconsin-Madison alumnus Jeff Greenfield on Feb. 14, the day 17 people were killed in a shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. By one count widely cited in the news media at the time, there had been 18 incidents in which shots were fired inside or outside of a school or university building in the United States to that point in 2018. But only three involved a mass shooting. And the count included two suicides, three accidental shootings and nine incidents in which there were no fatalities or injuries.

As for the rest of the world, Greenfield had no evidence to back up that part of his claim. And an expert relied on by the New York Times for gun violence statistics told us there was no way to know how many school shootings -- using the definition Greenfield relies on -- have occurred outside of the United States over the past 20 years. 2. ""If there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder."" Our rating: Half True. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin made the claim during his failed campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2018. He was on point in stating a gun is much more likely to be used for a suicide, assault or homicide than used in self-defense, but was on less solid ground when it comes to stating exactly how many times more likely. That depends on the study, many of which do not differentiate between known and unknown victims. What’s more, recent research is limited. 3. ""There are more guns in this country than there are people."" Our rating: Half True. The claim was made by Kevin Nicholson during his failed campaign for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination in 2018. There is no official count of the number of firearms in the United States. In one estimate, for 2009, the number of guns exceeded the population. But the most recent estimate cited by gun-statistics experts put the figure at 265 million guns as of January 2015, when the population was 320 million. 4. ""The three wealthiest people"" own ""more wealth than the bottom half of the American people."" Our rating: True. The statement by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was made during a campaign trip he made to Wisconsin to support the successful re-election effort of U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., in 2018. The wealth of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett exceeded that of the 160 million at the bottom of the scale, according to a 2017 study. And more recent estimates indicated the wealth of the three had since grown dramatically, widening the gap even more. 5. Says Tammy Baldwin is ""more worried about the mastermind of 9/11"" than supporting CIA director nominee Gina Haspel. Our rating: Pants on Fire. Leah Vukmir made that attack during the U.S. Senate primary campaign, in which she defeated Nicholson for the GOP nomination. She provided no information to back up an extreme claim that Baldwin had serious concern for a terrorist that was motivating her not to support President Donald Trump’s nominee. 6. Says that on the tax reform law, Democratic leaders ""are promising to take it all away."" U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who is retiring from Congress in January 2019, was referring to the GOP tax reform that was signed into law by Trump in December 2017. Our rating: Half True. Democratic leaders in Congress had been harshly critical of the law, and talked about the need to repeal or at least review most of it. But the tax reform law also provides tax benefits to the middle class, which the Democratic leaders indicated they want to keep. 7. Says that despite a recent increase in school funding, Scott Walker ""has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools."" Our rating: Mostly False. The attack on Walker, the Republican governor, was made by Democrat Tony Evers, the state superintendent of schools. Evers defeated Walker in the November 2018 election and takes office in January 2019. In Walker’s first year as governor, in 2011, he cut school aid by $426.5 million from the previous year. Because it took five years to get school funding back to that base level, it can be argued that Walker ""took"" a total of $1.17 billion from schools over that period. But since then, Walker increased school funding to the point that the deficit, in comparison to the base year, is $183.6 million. 8. Under ""his own legislation,"" Donald Trump's ""own family would not have been allowed into the country."" Our rating: Half True. That claim was made by Democrat Randy Bryce, who ran unsuccessfully for Ryan’s southern Wisconsin House seat in the 2018 election. Our analysis found that it seems unlikely, perhaps highly unlikely, that either Trump’s grandfather or his wife would have earned enough points under the legislation to be eligible for immigration. But, particularly with Melania Trump, the first lady, it couldn’t be known for certain. 9. In Wisconsin, Foxconn has ""4,000 jobs, people making $53,000 a year."" Our rating: Half True. Rapper-producer Kanye West, visiting Trump at the White House in October 2018, made that statement about the massive high-tech electronics factory under construction in southern Wisconsin. Foxconn says the plant will initially employ 3,000 people, and eventually 13,000, at an average wage of nearly $54,000 per year. But both figures are plans, albeit connected to a contract Foxconn has signed with the State of Wisconsin. 10. Says Scott Walker ""has turned down $1 billion of Medicaid money over the course of his tenure."" Our rating: Mostly True. The attack came during the 2018 primary campaign for governor by state Rep. Dana Wachs, who was seeking the Democratic nomination. Leaving aside whether Walker chose good policy or not, his decision not to do a ""full expansion"" of Medicaid means the state is spending about $1 billion more in state money on Medicaid than if it had accepted additional federal money that would come with a full expansion.

With the caveat that the figure is an estimate from the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, covering roughly 2014 to 2019, Wachs' statement was accurate. .    .  PolitiFact Wisconsin items as noted The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter District of Columbia

281,http://feeds.mashable.com/~r/Mashable/~3/h41tMbL0zFE/,"In 2018, practically anyone can accrue thousands of followers on social media, but only some people use their platform to amplify marginalized voices, promote social justice movements, and help organize on-the-ground action. Unsurprisingly, women were often the most effective activists of 2018. Emma González called B.S. on politicians who get funded by the National Rifle Association. More than 150 survivors of sexual abuse spoke at Larry Nassar's sentencing. Tina Tchen, Roberta Kaplan, Hilary B. Rosen, and Fatima Goss Graves gave ""time's up"" a new meaning when they co-founded the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund to connect sexual assault survivors to legal services. There's no denying the past 12 months have been devastating. Every day seemed to bring new injustice: attacks on women's rights, families being separated, gun violence, and other tragedies. But that didn't stop the below organizers from fighting to move this country forward, alongside these young activists, of course. Here are 13 trailblazers, presented in alphabetical order, that gave us hope for a better world: Ady Barkan, who has the incurable disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is known for his work to protect the Affordable Care Act and his related Be A Hero PAC campaign. In addition to his health care advocacy and voter mobilization efforts, he helped create a crowdfunding campaign to convince Senator Susan Collins to vote no on Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. If she voted against Kavanaugh, all the money would go back to the donors. When she instead voted for his confirmation, the money was earmarked to support her future Democratic opponent in the 2020 election. The campaign raised $3.7 million. As the #MeToo movement grew and evolved, founder Tarana Burke continued focusing on helping survivors of sexual violence heal, particularly black women and girls. She recently advocated for Cyntoia Brown's clemency on social media. Brown, who had been forced into sex trafficking as a teenager, was sentenced to prison for life after she killed a man who hired her for prostitution, in 2004. Burke co-wrote a letter of support for Christine Blasey Ford after she testified before Congress about being sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh. In partnership with The New York Women's Foundation, Burke created the Fund for the MeToo Movement and Allies to fund anti-sexual violence groups that support marginalized and underserved communities. She also raised awareness about #MuteRKelly, a campaign that demands the music industry stop supporting the singer, who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault. Rachel Cargle critically analyzes white feminism and explores the ""intersection of race and womanhood"" through her workshops, Harper's Bazaar essays, and social media posts. To celebrate her 30th birthday, she raised over $100,000 to finance mental health counseling and therapy for black women and girls. Although she surpassed her original goal, and has raised $165,000, Cargle continues to accept donations so she can fund mental health care year-round. The successful campaign will soon become a nonprofit, according to Cargle. Superstore actress America Ferrera traveled the country to mobilize voters ahead of the midterm elections. That included teaming up with singer Alicia Keys in Dallas, Natalie Portman in Arizona, and Jane the Virgin star Gina Rodriguez in Florida. Ferrera published the book American Like Me: Reflections on Life Between Cultures. It features stories from Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, Bad Feminist author Roxane Gay, and figure skater Michelle Kwan. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants star was also a key member of the Time's Up campaign, an effort to combat sexual harassment in the entertainment industry. In 2017, Jamie Margolin founded Zero Hour, a youth-led movement working to give everyone access to a ""clean, safe, and healthy environment."" The organizers use an intersectional lens, meaning they understand marginalized communities are most vulnerable to the effects of air pollution and climate-related changes in the environment. This year, Margolin and other young activists marched on Washington, D.C., to demand elected representatives stop taking money from fossil fuel companies. Margolin and 12 other young people also sued her home state of Washington over its role in the climate crisis. The case was dismissed, but she continues to organize and raise awareness about climate justice. Since posting her viral ""me too"" tweet last year, Alyssa Milano spent 2018 amplifying the work of #MeToo founder Tarana Burke. In September, Milano went viral again after she was spotted staring down Brett Kavanaugh during his Senate Judiciary hearing. The actress was in the courtroom to show solidarity with Christine Blasey Ford, who testified against the Supreme Court nominee. She's also advocated for vulnerable communities on social media, including migrants at the border who were separated from their families. On Thanksgiving, she encouraged her Twitter followers to raise $100,000 for the Families Belong Together campaign. In a Rolling Stone article published earlier this year, Janelle Monáe came out as pansexual. The cover story was a huge milestone for the singer and increased visibility for the LGBTQ community. Merriam-Webster revealed the term pansexual was the top search of the day. Monáe also broke boundaries with her 2018 album Dirty Computer, which received a nomination for album of the year at the 2019 Grammy Awards. At this year's ceremony, she showed support for the Time's Up movement during a powerful speech. ""We come in peace, but we mean business,"" she said. ""And to those who would dare try to silence us, we offer two words: Time’s up."" After they survived a mass shooting at their school, numerous students from Marjory Douglas Stoneman high school in Parkland, Florida, spoke out against gun violence. Emma González captured the nation's attention when she delivered her captivating ""We call B.S."" speech. The students formed March For Our Lives, organized a nationwide march to advocate for gun control, and then went into overdrive to mobilize voters. They launched a campaign called Turnout Tuesday, which provided young people with a step-by-step guide on how to register voters and encourage voter turnout before the midterm elections. The young activists also even teamed up with Marvel stars, including Captain America's Chris Evans and Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman, to create a PSA about their first time voting. As the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, Ai-jen Poo is at the forefront of protecting the rights of domestic workers, including housekeepers, nannies, and elder care providers. The NDWA recently launched Alia, the first-ever portable benefits system for domestic workers. Poo is also the co-chair of Families Belong Together, a coalition of organizations fighting to aid and reunite the families that were separated as a result of President Trump's immigration policies. Mónica Ramírez is the co-founder of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, the founder of Justice for Migrant Women, and gender justice campaigns director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance. Ramírez has long advocated on behalf of migrant and immigrant women, and she became a critical part of the Time's Up movement in 2018. Ramírez attended the Golden Globes with Big Little Lies' Laura Dern to raise awareness about Time's Up. Although it was a celebrity event, the ceremony helped spread awareness about the larger movement, which includes women across industries. Ramírez recently reflected on what the growing attention has meant for the farmworker movement. Tina Tchen, Roberta Kaplan, Hilary B. Rosen, and Fatima Goss Graves co-founded the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund earlier this year to connect sexual assault survivors to legal services. So far, the fund has helped over 3,700 people facing workplace harassment. More than 150 women, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney, spoke at Larry Nassar's sentencing. Nassar, the former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor, was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for sexual abuse. The victims' statements gave survivors, and Americans in general, hope that conversations about sexual assault and harassment might be shifting in the right direction. Rachael Denhollander, a former gymnast, was the first survivor to come forward in 2016, and this year, she was recognized as Inspiration of the Year by Sports Illustrated's Sportsperson of the Year Awards. Raquel Willis, a transgender activist and speaker, made history when she was hired as the first transgender woman in a leadership role at Out magazine. As a national organizer for the Transgender Law Center, she developed Black Trans Circles, a program dedicated to ""building the leadership of Black trans women in the South and Midwest."" Willis also joined the Biden Foundation's LGBTQ Equality Advisory Council, which helps the nonprofit create programs and messaging that will create social change. On social media and through her writing, Willis continuously amplifies voices in the transgender community. UPDATE: Dec. 21, 2018, 4:20 p.m. EST An earlier version of this article stated Ady Barkan's crowdfunding campaign raised over $2.2 million. It’s been updated to reflect the most recent amount of $3.7. Related Video: Time's up for gender-based violence More in

Shaima Swileh wore dark glasses as she walked into the arrivals terminal at San Francisco international airport on Wednesday night. A group of supporters carrying placards greeted her.  Her son, Abdullah Hassan, a US citizen like his father, suffers from a rare genetic brain condition and is on life support in a hospital in Oakland, California. Swileh had been unable to join him because of Trump’s order barring visitors from six countries including Yemen. After a tearful televised plea from the boy’s father prompted public outrage, the US embassy in Cairo issued a visa for Swileh, who has been living temporarily in Egypt. After the waiver was granted, her husband, Ali Hassan, expressed relief and said: “This will allow us to mourn with dignity.” Hassan said he had been ready to take his son off life support last week after doctors said the case was terminal, with his wife only receiving automated replies when inquiring about her visa application with US authorities. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, which is assisting the family, launched a campaign that it said prompted 15,000 emails to elected officials as well as thousands of tweets. Abdullah’s grandfather earlier told the San Francisco Chronicle that Swileh was crying every day as she wanted to see her son “one last time”. “To hold him for at least a minute. She’s not going to see him forever,” he said. Exceptions to Trump’s ban are extremely rare. The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the US president’s order, said only 2% of applicants had been granted waivers. Trump vowed during the 2016 election campaign to ban all Muslims from entering the US, despite constitutional protections for freedom of religion, after a mass shooting in California by a couple of Pakistani descent.

House Democrats hold first committee hearing on Capitol riot News By Joshua Rhett Miller Submit December 20, 2018 | 12:21pm				| Updated December 20, 2018 | 12:45pm A sheriff’s deputy in Florida who murdered three relatives before taking his own life was once named the agency’s Officer of the Year — and was rehired after retiring two years ago to improve security at an elementary school that his youngest victim attended. Deputy Terry L. Strawn, 58, was named Officer of the Year for the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office in 2009 for his tireless efforts as a lawman, the Tampa Bay Times reports. “Deputy Strawn is persistent, leaving no stone unturned in his pursuit of the lawbreakers,” former Sheriff David Gee said at the time. “Recently he arrested a fugitive and an armed robbery suspect after a traffic stop. His high rate of success in the location and capture of numerous suspects has earned him this year’s top honor in east Hillsborough County.” After joining the department in 1991, Strawn later began working as a jail deputy before joining the agency’s road patrol in 1995. He then retired from the department about two years ago, only to get rehired last summer as district officials sought to improve security within Hillsborough County, particularly at elementary schools. The partnership between sheriff and district officials was created in the aftermath of a new law passed following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where 17 people were killed on Feb. 14. Strawn, according to the newspaper, was among more than 100 officers recruited and trained to protect elementary school students. He had been performing so well of late at the school — which his granddaughter also attended — that he was rehired back on a permanent basis, Sheriff Chad Chronister told the newspaper. Chronister told reporters Wednesday that Strawn used his service revolver to fatally shoot his wife, Theresa, 54, before gunning down his 32-year-old daughter, Courtney, and 6-year-old granddaughter, Londyn, who attended Valrico Elementary School. After killing his relatives, Strewn announced on the main channel of the agency’s radio system that he had “emergency traffic” before admitting to killing his relatives and providing directions to where two of the bodies could be found, Chronister said. Strawn then indicated that he planned on killing himself at Plant City High School, where deputies later found his body just east of the building. “At one point, he said he had to go, he wanted to be with his family,” Chronister said. Strawn also said he was having financial issues and health problems, but no red flags were found pertaining to his finances during a background check conducted last summer as part of his return to the agency. Strawn and his wife filed for bankruptcy protection in 2011, estimating at the time that their assets of less than $50,000 were outpaced by their liabilities. Still, the Strawns had qualified for a mortgage just a year earlier, according to court records cited by the Tampa Bay Times. Parents at the school where Strawn worked, meanwhile, said they were stunned that a man hired to protect their children would commit such egregious acts of violence. “I find that hard to believe because he was such a nice guy,” one parent told WTSP. “I’m in shock.” Another parent said she had “nothing but good things to say” about Strawn. Strawn is the second Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office employee in recent months to take his own life after killing a relative. Deputy Kirk Keithley, 39, fatally shot his 33-year-old wife, Samantha, inside their home while their four children were inside on Sept. 24. Chronister told WTSP that all of the agency’s deputies will begin receiving training on how to deal with depression and suicidal thoughts.

Magistrate Judge Autumn Spaeth set Dzung Ahn Pham’s bond at $80,000 during a hearing at the federal courthouse in Santa Ana. Pham was ordered not to contact prior patients to whom he prescribed controlled substances, and not to further prescribe such substances to anyone else. Pham, who spent the night in jail after being arrested Tuesday, did not enter a plea. His attorney, Julie Swain, declined to comment after the hearing. Pham, a Tustin resident and owner of the Irvine Village Urgent Care, faces two federal counts of illegally distributing oxycodone, which prosecutors say are tied to allegations that he sold the prescription drugs to a woman he never saw as a patient. Prosecutors in a lengthy court filing made public Tuesday allege that Pham routinely gave out large quantities of powerful narcotics to dozens of patients, oftentimes the exact medications and quantities the patients specifically requested. The U.S. Attorneys Office described Pham as “flooding Southern California with huge quantities of opioids and other dangerous narcotics by writing prescriptions for drugs he knew would be diverted to the street.” At least five people suspected of receiving and filling prescriptions from Pham died of drug overdoses, prosecutors alleged. He has not been charged in connection to their deaths. Authorities also allege that narcotics prescribed by Pham were in the systems of a driver accused of fatally striking a Costa Mesa fire captain out for a morning bike ride, as well as in the possession of the gunman who carried out the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand oaks that claimed the lives of 13 people. Stephen Taylor Scarpa is facing a murder charge in state court for allegedly veering into a bike lane while driving along Alicia Parkway in Mission Viejo and hitting Costa Mesa fire Capt. Mike Kreza from behind last month. Federal prosecutors allege that Scarpa told investigators that he was on medications prescribed by Pham, and say prescription bottles with Pham’s name on them were found in Scarpa’s vehicle after the fatal crash. Federal prosecutors also allege that Pham in text messages obtained by investigators indicated prescription bottles of his that he had given to someone else were found in the possession of Ian David Long, the gunman who carried out the Borderline shooting that left 13 dead last month. Pham was ordered to return to court on Jan. 22.

Laura Ingraham lost eight sponsors from her Fox News show this week after criticizing Parkland shooting survivor and activist David Hogg. And it's not even the first time she's been at the center of a public feud this year. Here are several recent instances where Ingraham has taken to Twitter or to the air and stirred national attention.

David Hogg
On March 28, Ingraham tweeted, ""David Hogg by Rejected Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it."" Hogg then called for a boycott of 12 companies that advertise on Ingraham's show. Eight sponsors in all, Hulu, TripAdvisor, Wayfair, Nutrish, Expedia, Stitch Fix, Johnson & Johnson and Nestle pulled their ads from “The Ingraham Angle.” Ingraham issued an apology, but didn't address the topic on her show and hasn't yet deleted her original tweet. Hogg then told CNN that he plans to put even more pressure on Ingraham and others. “The fact that they’re going after us personally shows that what we’re doing is working. We have them scared and now we have to go even harder,” Hogg said.

LeBron James
When NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Durant made some anti-Trump remarks during an interview with ESPN's Cari Champion, Ingraham called James's comments ""ignorant"" and said, ""You’re great players; no one voted for you. Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, ‘shut up and dribble.'” Her statement earned a strong response from James, even though he said he didn't even know Ingraham's name. “I will not just shut up and dribble,” the Cleveland Cavaliers player said. “So, thank you, whatever her name is … I get to sit up here and talk about what’s really important and how I can help change kids."" Ingraham issued a statement that there was no racial intent behind her words and that she has used the expression telling entertainers to ""Shut Up"" frequently in the past.

Hillary Clinton
While speaking at the Republican National Convention, Ingraham was criticized for appearing to give the Nazi salute after her speech. She then dragged Hillary Clinton into the controversy, tweeting a collage of photos of Clinton also extending her hand in a similar fashion. ""It's Hillary ... hands down!"" ""Duh … it’s a satiric response to the left-wing criticism of Laura’s wave last night. Desperate liberals,” Ingraham tweeted.

Paul Ryan
Back in 2015 when Paul Ryan was being considered to be Speaker of the House, he said he would accept the job on the condition that ""family comes first."" ""I cannot and I will not give up my family time,"" Ryan said. Ingraham tweeted, but later deleted, a criticism saying, ""like no one has ever sacrificed family time to serve the country?"" ""Our country is in a crisis and we need Republican leaders willing to unconditionally offer their service to the country,"" she added in a separate tweet.

Mika Brzezinski
Engaged hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough have a habit of getting flirty on ""Morning Joe,"" and Ingraham finds it hilarious. On Feb. 8, Sean Hannity prepared to hand off the time Ingraham when she started twirling her hair, lilting her voice and doing her best flirty Brzenzski impression. “What, what Sean, you’re always right. No you’re always right. You. Are. Always. Right. I mean, really,” Ingraham said. 
Fox





Ed Schultz
Ingraham didn't start this fight. The MSNBC personality called Ingraham a ""right-wing slut"" on his radio show, a comment that earned him a week-long suspension from MSNBC. He apologized and called his comments ""vile and inappropriate,"" and Ingraham accepted his apology. She even joked that Schultz used to be conservative. ""We'll welcome you back with open arms,"" she said.
MSNBC





Donald Trump
In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Ingraham critiqued the president for leaving much of his executive branch understaffed. “We can all look at these horrific pictures, and we can conclude that a federal government does need staff,"" Ingraham said. Trump, a frequent viewer of ""Fox & Friends,"" heard Ingraham's criticism of his administration loud and clear and responded to her directly on Twitter. ""We are not looking to fill all of those positions. Don't need many of them — reduce size of government,” Trump tweeted.

Shepard Smith
Fox News anchor Shepard Smith gave some pointed criticism to his colleagues, telling Time that he knows some of Fox's opinion shows are ""strictly to be entertaining."" ""I don’t work there. I wouldn’t work there. I don’t want to sit around and yell at each other and talk about your philosophy and my philosophy. That sounds horrible to me.” Both Sean Hannity and Ingraham took issue with Smith's comments. ""Always liked Shep, but his comments were inconsiderate & inaccurate. The hard working team at the Ingraham Angle does real reporting, develops impt sources and scores big interviews. Very proud of them,"" she tweeted.

288,https://www.theroot.com/the-2018-wypipo-awards-1831267430,"Welcome to the fourth annual Wypipo Awards. For those in attendance for the first time, all of our winners are of the Caucasian variety, so it’s just like the Grammys or the Oscars except the winner gets a golden jar of mayonnaise. One of the reasons white people pass voter ID laws, disenfranchise voters and hate on the BET Awards is that white people are afraid black people won’t vote for them. So, in our efforts to promote diversity and ensure that everyone knows that white lives matter, our founder, Mr. Y.P. Pull—who made his fortune building desalinization plants that take the salt out of white tears and use it to irrigate kale farms—started this award show to recognize the most influential wypipo. Each year, we impanel a group of experts including: Here are this year’s nominees and winners: I don’t believe that men aren’t supposed to cry but men aren’t supposed to cry like this. Brett burst into tears in front of the entire world when he thought that his lifelong white male privilege scholarship might be taken away just because he allegedly attempted to rape someone. My personal theory is that he wasn’t crying and that was just beer oozing out of his tear ducts. Regardless, Brett wins for giving us the best, up-close version of white tears in 2018. NRA spokesperson and former infomercial actress Dana Loesch is what would happen if Satan fucked a cactus plant. The evil queen of the National Rifle association laughed at children who had just survived a mass shooting and said white mothers whose children were killed was “ratings gold.” Dana Loesch’s mouth continues to serve double duty as the gun manufacturing industry’s anus. She doesn’t care about shit because her ultimate goal is to gain immortality by dethroning the Wicked Witch of the West. The largest source of money for the NFL is television revenue. That money is determined by ratings. If you watch the NFL on anything other than an over-the-air antenna, your viewership boosts the NFL’s ratings, thus providing them with more revenue. The reason they can get away with banning Colin Kaepernick and silencing protests is that they made a business decision that white viewers were more important and that black people will continue to contribute to the oppression of their own people if the entertainment value is high enough. Apparently, they are right. Not since Alabama governor George Wallace’s inauguration have a group of white people been so racist. They created the child separation policy, covered for him when he talked about “shithole countries,” dismantled clean air and water regulations, aided with collusion with Russia, lied about readily available statistics, vilified the press, excused white supremacists, lowered taxes on the rich, dismantled health care and obstructed justice. And that was just yesterday! Perhaps no news outlet, including the Federalist and White Entertainment Television (Fox News) shined a flattering light on white supremacy as much as the New York Times. They had an op-ed about how much they missed WASPs. They did a glowing feature on “the white supremacist next door.” They hired a Nazi Sympathizer. They fired a woman of color for “reverse racism.” If Lena Dunham fucked Breitbart, she would give birth to the New York Times. Perhaps no white woman’s fortune has risen and fallen as quickly as the Aryan, arrogant Secretary of Homeland Security. She was in charge of the child separation policy. She is still trying to institute the travel ban. She is in charge of rounding up people who have lived in the U.S. for years. She was upset when she was kicked out of a Mexican restaurant but she also refused to admit that Trump referred to Nigeria and Haiti as “shithole” countries. I won’t lie, there are some white people I like just because they don’t like Trump and Jim Acosta is one of them. I am sure that Jim Acosta has personally declared that Donald Trump is and will forever be in his “on sight” category. Jim Acosta really wants to whip Trump’s ass and, while I don’t advocate violence, I’d pay somewhere between $4 and whatever is in my 401k to see him throw Donald Trump a fair one. When it comes to underhanded white people shit, Brian Kemp is in a class by himself. He purged voters from voter rolls. He threw out ballots. He oversaw an unauditable election. He left the back door open for hackers. He left the front door open for hackers. He cozied up to white supremacists. He oversaw his own gubernatorial race. He gave black voters faulty voting machines. He race-baited. He fear-mongered. He lied. He cheated. And ultimately, he stole a Georgia election that could have seen the first black woman governor in American history. You gotta give it to Brian Kemp, he might be evil, but he’s thorough. Plus, if you don’t “give it to him,” he’ll probably steal it anyway. Since time immemorial, calling the police on black people has been one of white America’s favorite pastimes. When Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, the only reason he called Watson was that he didn’t get an answer when he dialed 911 on his laboratory janitor, Jebediah. Bell said Jeb looked “suspicious,” but Jebediah was just trying to find out why this crazy white man kept talking into an electric box. Since that day, white people have enjoyed summoning their societal protectors on black people. We dedicate this award to some of the most notorious police-callers including Susan Smith, who drowned her children and said that a black man did it. We celebrate the unknown caller who dialed 911 on Tamir Rice. We honor Ronald Ritchie, who used his cell phone to call the cops on a man buying a BB gun in Walmart, leading to the death of John Crawford. We recognize all of the lynch mob starters from Rosewood, Fla., to Jackson, Miss. We salute the false rape accuser of the Scottsboro Boys. We honor the Tulsa, Okla., store clerk who heard Sarah Page scream on May 30, 1921. That clerk called the police on 19-year-old Dick Rowland, igniting the riots that would burn down Black Wall Street. And we honor the hashtags including: #BBQBecky, #PermitPatty, #PoolPatrolPaula, #CornerStoreCaroline, #BrooklynBecky, #PaulBlartPoolCop, #BaggageClaimBecky, #CouponCarl, #DepressedDebbie and anyone we may have missed. Just so you know: Even though we might give you those funny names, we don’t think of this as a joke... We’re just tired of being the only ones whose names become hashtags. This is disappointing and downright irresponsible. There are almost ten full days left in 2018, given the rate at which white people have been acting up (or caught mid-outburst) there’s zero chance that there won’t be at least one incident worthy of consideration between now and the new year.  Next year hold the awards in January so every candidate can be given the consideration they deserve.",2018-12-21 20:00:00,The 2018 Wypipo Awards,"motion pictures,blacks,television,awards, decorations and honors",368082,http://theroot.com/

12.26.2018 2:00 PM Social media are teeming with people who like to publicly worry about imaginary risks. That's not a good thing. But is it a crime? According to an Ohio jury and judge, it is, at least when someone's worries are echoed by others, resulting in irritating phone calls and emails to government officials. Last week Barberton Municipal Judge David Fish sentenced Erin Croghan to three days in jail, a month of house arrest, and a year without social media for ""inducing panic"" by using Facebook to repeat an unfounded rumor about a pellet gun found at a local school. It could have been worse. Inducing panic is a first-degree misdemeanor in Ohio, meaning it is punishable by a maximum fine of $1,000 and up to six months in jail. Then again, some might question whether saying dumb stuff on Facebook should be a crime at all, given that the First Amendment is supposed to protect even ill-informed and misleading commentary. Croghan's journey to jail began on November 2, 2017, when she was at her daughter's school bus stop and heard that another student had seen a gun at school the day before. Croghan asked her daughter's teacher at Coventry Elementary School about the rumor and eventually heard from Coventry Local Schools Superintendent Lisa Blough, who said kids riding a bus had seen a middle school student with a pellet gun in his front yard as they passed by his house. Blough assured Croghan that no gun had been found at any of the schools she oversees. Croghan evidently did not believe Blough, because she revived the rumor several months later, following the February 14 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. ""A student brought a gun to school a few months ago,"" she claimed on the ""Portage Lakes Rocks!"" Facebook page. (Portage Lakes is a town south of Akron that apparently aspires to be as cool as Cleveland.) Croghan said the weapon was a pellet gun but ""still could've caused harm,"" adding that she was ""just curious if parents were made aware of this past incident."" Croghan's post prompted other parents to contact Tina Marie Norris, the Coventry Middle School principal. At Croghan's trial, the Akron Beacon Journal reports, Norris testified that ""the assistant principal was off the day after Croghan's post,"" so Norris ""spent her entire day fielding phone calls and emails from concerned parents."" She said parents were ""significantly worried."" Norris responded on Facebook at the time, saying no guns had been found at any Coventry schools. ""This type of post is why social media is dangerous,"" she wrote. Croghan refused to back down. Instead she speculated that Norris and other school officials were lying about the purported incident so as not to endanger voter approval of funding for the school district. ""The posts kept getting more outrageous and, frankly, very attacking,"" Norris testified. It's not clear whether Croghan knowingly spread fake news or was just confused and stubborn. ""It simply was a false report that Erin Croghan put out there for attention-seeking behavior,"" Assistant Barberton Prosecutor Michelle Banbury said during her opening statement. ""I wish I could explain why she did what she did. I don't have a motive."" To convict Croghan, Banbury was supposed to prove that she knew the pellet gun rumor was false, and there seems to be reasonable doubt on that point. It also seems like a stretch to claim that annoying Norris qualifies as ""serious public inconvenience or alarm,"" another element of the crime that Croghan supposedly committed. ""You heard there was no robocall, no evacuation, no lockdown,"" Croghan's lawyer, Jeff Laybourne, told the jury. ""If it had been 'serious,' those things would have occurred."" He said the ""serious public inconvenience or alarm"" alleged by the prosecution amounted to ""phone calls from parents to administrators who are paid by taxpayers as part of their job to answer phone calls."" Laybourne also noted the First Amendment implications of the case. ""They have criminalized freedom of speech on Facebook,"" he said, arguing that convicting Croghan could have a ""chilling effect"" on ""concerned parents and their ability to ask questions."" This precedent might make people think twice before passing along unsubstantiated rumors, but it also could deter people from questioning the government's position on any number of issues where the facts are unclear. Could strongly worded Facebook posts about a controversial police shooting be construed as ""inducing panic"" by convincing young black men that cops pose a deadly danger to them? What about tweets alleging that the government's preparations for an impending natural disaster are woefully inadequate? Croghan's sentence is particularly troubling because it includes a prior restraint on her speech, banning her from social media during her year of probation. Last year the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a North Carolina law banning registered sex offenders from social media was inconsistent with the First Amendment. This case involves a probation condition rather than a statute, and the ban lasts a year rather than decades. Then again, Croghan's crime pales in comparison to those of many people covered by the North Carolina law. Croghan, who is appealing her conviction, asked Judge Fish to at least let her use Facebook to coordinate her volunteer work for a local program that provides food to needy families. He said she would have to get someone else to fill that role or find another method of identifying recipients. The Columbus Dispatch reports that Fish ""said Croghan is the 'ultimate contradiction' because she does so much good in the community but also made these erroneous posts."" Alluding to the ""counseling"" that Croghan is undergoing, the judge told her, ""I think you're going to get there. You're a good person, Erin."" Fish nevertheless thought Croghan's reckless disregard for the truth justified a jail sentence and one year of enforced silence on social media. Myriad good but misguided people commit similar crimes every day. ""If we're going to charge every person who puts misinformation on Facebook,"" Laybourne told the jury, ""this place will be inundated.""

Doubt it and suspect this law will only be used to punish us little people. Or politicians and journolists who repeat fake news. They are arguably far worse than moms on FaceBook, since they buy ink by the barrel, or at least commandeer it. Little people or not, if you do anything that risks damaging a reputation (particularly an academic reputation, and especially the reputation of a faculty member here at NYU) there is a good chance you will be serving time in one of our nation’s jails. As one of the federal judges reviewing the state court decisions in of America’s leading criminal “satire” case pointed out, disseminating unwanted email “parodies” is like “shooting a gun out there, in the air.” See the documentation at: https://raphaelgolbtrial.wordpress.com/ P.s. see also: https://tinyurl.com/nytimes-item As the article demonstrates, anyone who sends out fake FB material, especially dealing with political or academic matters, clearly risks jail. Of course they will – if they’re publishing rumors that attack the wrong people. As long as they publish unsubstantiated material about the current out-group they’ll be fine. It’ll be used to further cement the government’s control over media. The conviction is clearly unconstitutional and, I believe, the statute itself is unconstitutionally overbroad. Hopefully she can find competent pro bono appellate representation. I’d certainly volunteer in a minute we’re I admitted in Ohio. Now that’s way too far! I want accountability for internet censorship and official fake news on so called news networks, but an unknowing citizen or someone just gossiping on social media is nothing! Who knows what we spread that may not have all the facts? Jail time or probation is going way too far into draconian tyranny! https://aladyofreason.wordpress.com/ This woman does not need to be punished for her derangement…She needs to be institutionalized. All of this trouble, for her and the public officials, whether it be the school or justice system, over a fucking pellet gun. Get a fucking clue, woman. Who says it was just a pellet gun? Remember how this supposedly started: kids on a school bus saw someone in a front yard with a pellet gun. How did the kids know it was a pellet gun? How did the principle and/or other authorities know it was a pellet gun? Seriously. Did the authorities go track down this front yard and the brandisher? It would have been at least half an hour before they could figure out what front yard, and then how could they confirm it by finding the brandisher? Then they’d have to verify that he was brandishing a gun, what gun it was, and so on. I really doubt they could do any of that. Yeah; maybe the pellets were .357 and weighed 158 grains? Why should they do any of that? Guns have become some sort of magical totem. Weird. YOU ARE ONE OF THE REASONS THIS COUNTRY IS SCREWED…… HOPE YOU GET A TASTE OF THE CHIT YOUR SHOVELIN….. …Fish “said Croghan is the ‘ultimate contradiction’ because she does so much good in the community but also made these erroneous posts.” Objective good and objective bad. Truly a Solomon-like wisdom. More Alzheimer’s than Solomon. Banning people from social media is actually a proven cause of violence. No that is not an excuse. But it’s also why this country protects free speech – to reduce pretexts for violence that occurred all too frequently in Europe. Yes people can be irresponsible online, but the great thing about social media is that anyone can respond from around the world to correct the record. This is also why I don’t blame Facebook for the Myanmar Muslim massacres. Because really it’s up to us, the users, to confront it. Just censoring it won’t help, because it becomes an escalating cat-and-mouse game. (Also getting banned from social media is my worst nightmare. This was a painful story to read. Though now I think I could make do if it ever came to that.) “Banning people from social media is actually a proven cause of violence. ” That sounds vaguely like you, a person who has been repeatedly banned, making a veiled threat. I would never resort to violence. I am a ‘turn the other cheek’ kind of guy. I would never make a threat or veiled threat either. However I think it’s important to understand why our country was founded, which may require exposing some uncomfortable dynamics of human nature. If only she’d lied about her military record she’d have been protected by the 1st Amendment. Erin Croghan put out there for attention-seeking behavior If “attention-seeking behavior” is a crime in Ohio, they will need more women’s prisons. I mean if she went on and on about it it may rise to the level of a crime. You can’t falsely shout fire you know. Barberton. That explains it. If you find yourself in Barberton you took a wrong turn somewhere. ” (Portage Lakes is a town south of Akron that apparently aspires to be as cool as Cleveland.) ” Funniest line I read all day. ^ “If we’re going to charge every person who puts misinformation on Facebook,” Laybourne told the jury, “this place will be inundated.” Uh-oh, that sounds like a panic-inducing statement. We should all probably call Barberton Municipal Judge David Fish and check to see if we’re all indeed facing charges for putting misinformation on Facebook. not clear whether Croghan knowingly spread fake news or was just confused and stubborn I honestly think it doesn’t matter here. We can have a conversation about whether or not ‘spreading fake news’ *should be illegal* (I lean on the side of ‘it innoculates people and teaches them how to sort falsehood from truth) but its not illegal – and what she did CLEARLY did not cause a ‘panic’ by any definition of the work in English. Any version of English. “I honestly think it doesn’t matter here. We can have a conversation about whether or not ‘spreading fake news’ *should be illegal*” We could and it shoudn’t. It isn’t. Spreading fake news is not illegal. Saying anything is not illegal. I mean: Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech is not that fucking difficult, people! Yep, it isn’t, this is a terrible decision and needs to be appealed. I’m going to kill you. What we need in this country is common sense panic control. People should have to get a permit before being allowed to post on social media. The local sheriff, who would know the citizens well could be allowed to issue the permits, based on proof of taking some kind of training course about the kinds of things that spread panic at stuff. To allow the sheriff to handle this workload, the permits could be self funded by a fee of a couple of hundred dollars. That way we can be sure people are posting under their real names, because the sheriff can make sure everyone sets up their social media at the sheriff office, and he checks their identity. Yeah, that’s the ticket. And if someone says bad things, their permit can be revoked. A full background check would be a good idea, to be sure no bad guys get a social account, you know, Russians or somebody. Their could be a second classification for high volume posting, with a commensurate additional training and fee requirement. I’m kinda ok with this because she was trying to interfere with someone’s civil rights in some way. But it would be nice if the deranged busy bodies who call 911 that ultimately leads to the murder of an innocent man would also go to jail. More jails? A great idea! Once the masses are incarcerated, then they will appreciate the socialist slavery our ruling elitists offer them more readily. No one appreciates slavery until they’re locked up in one of our wonderful gulags for a few years. >>>resulting in irritating phone calls and emails to government officials government officials were put on this planet to irritate via phone and email. Judge Fish is just another foolish judge, doing his best to discredit the legal system. Judicial egos know no limits. At least his foolishness is public and will help expose the misuse of criminal law in a vain effort to control human behavior. Now we just need more jurors to say no to such stupid cases. If they would jail all the folks saying Trump has had sex with his daughter, it might be worth it. We used to play army in the woods with pellet/BB guns. Nobody gave a shit. seconded. Can’t see where she posted ‘misinformation’ at all. Can’t see where she posted ‘misinformation’ at all. “kids riding a bus had seen a middle school student with a pellet gun in his front yard as they passed by his house” vs.: “A student brought a gun to school a few months ago,” she claimed on the “Portage Lakes Rocks!” Facebook page. But “kids riding a bus had seen a middle school student with a pellet gun in his front yard as they passed by his house” is the school’s story. There’s zero proof that it’s any more or less correct than hers. As other’s have pointed out, how did these kids know it was a pellet gun? Why wasn’t THAT kid on a bus? The ‘pellet gun’ point actually suggests that she’s the one telling the truth. Because you’d have to have the gun to know it was a pellet gun. You know what we WON’T see from this? Other histrionic gun grabbers being jailed for spreading misinformation. Shame. If you want to spread rumors tell your sister-in-law and swear her to secrecy. Far more efficient than this Facebook thing. United Soviet States of America So this judge? What’s the story? Doesn’t understand the clear meaning of the Constitution that he swore to uphold? Or something less, to be delicate, less benign? So we are now jailing people just for being stupid? Judge is a joke.

291,https://jezebel.com/parkland-shooter-obsessively-texted-girl-he-labeled-in-1831262617,"On Friday, the Broward Sherrif’s Office (BSO) released a report detailing information about the man behind the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. While the most salacious detail—that the Parkland shooter, a fan of Donald Trump, put a “Make American Great Again” hat in the casket of his liberal mother—is making the rounds, there’s another telling detail that’s getting far less attention than it deserves. The Miami Herald reports that Nikolas Cruz harassed a girl who lived near his workplace, obsessively texting and calling her non-stop in the weeks leading up to the February 14 shooting. This girl was referenced in a video Cruz made on his phone right before the shooting. BSO released the video in May. “My love for you, [redacted], will never go away,” Cruz said, topping off a droning speech about his loneliness, isolation, and anger. “I hope to see you in the afterlife.” Cruz stored her as “Warning Love of Your Life” in his phone’s contacts. While the girl texted with Cruz, she never dated him and did not reciprocate those feelings, reporting that she was afraid of him. The Miami Herald reports: Five days before the shooting, she agreed to meet with Cruz at a Coral Springs Target “because he seemed depressed.” She “stated that she insisted that Cruz meet her in a public place because she was afraid of him,” the detective wrote. The day before the massacre, Cruz sent her a text saying he “felt like killing people.” She said she deleted the text because she was angry with his behavior. That day, he flooded her with phone calls, insisting he wanted to be her boyfriend and her Valentine the next day, Feb. 14 When she rebuffed his desires, he said he was going to see a therapist and ended a call with an ominous sounding “goodbye.” On the day of the shooting, Cruz called her while she was taking a test at her high school. She never answered, but that didn’t stop Cruz from sending her photos of the scars on his arms. That day, Cruz proceeded to shoot 34 people at Stoneman Douglas High School; 17 students and teachers died. The emotional manipulation Cruz used against this girl is stomach churning, and maddeningly familiar: Men, their entitlement to women’s affection, and the violence that engulfs it all. The link between murder and domestic violence is impossible to ignore. Several mass shooters have a history of violence and harassment against women. “A smart, sweet, quiet boy,” is how the family of Dimitrios Pagourtzis described him shortly after… And there’s an entire genre of Sad Boy that emerges in the wake of violent acts on school campuses. The teen behind a mass shooting at a Santa Fe, Texas high school in May shot and killed a girl who allegedly rejected the shooter. A Connecticut boy stabbed his crush to death when she didn’t agree to go to prom with him. And there’s Elliot Rodger, who wrote a rambling, misogynistic screed before shooting and killing sorority girls at the University of California at Santa Barbara; he has since become an icon to bitter misogynists the world over. As for Cruz, even if his love wasn’t part of his twisted rationale behind the Parkland shooting, he is now a part of this familiar cast of characters. Dear girls: you are under no obligation to be nice to someone who creeps you out. You do not need to date a guy just because he says you're the love of his life. And you do not have to ""give him a chance"".",2018-12-21 15:15:00,Parkland Shooter Obsessively Texted Girl He Labeled in His Contacts As 'Warning Love Of Your Life',"education and schools,murders and attempted murders",6154,http://jezebel.com
292,https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2018/12/here-are-the-people-trump-said-the-death-penalty-should-be-used-against-this-year/,"Andrew Harnik/AP Over the last year, President Donald Trump has repeatedly emphasized the death penalty in televised speeches, statements, and tweets. Sometimes, it was invoked in reference to certain groups, like drug dealers; other times, the president applied it to a specific individual, as he did just after the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre. Trump’s infatuation with the death penalty isn’t new. Even before his foray into politics, he tweeted about cases where he thought capital punishment would be appropriate. He called for it when Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl made headlines for being captured after he deserted his post in Afghanistan, and in the cases of the Boston Marathon bomber and the Aurora shooter. In comparison, a search of former President Barack Obama’s Twitter archive finds zero results for the words “death penalty.” More famously, in 1985, Trump bought $85,000 in ads that called for the execution of the Central Park Five, who were ultimately exonerated through DNA evidence. As president, Trump has clung to the death penalty as a tough-on-crime solution in specific circumstances, despite research that shows the death penalty has not deterred crime, and, in practice, is often arbitrary, racist, and imposed against innocent people. Here’s a breakdown of how the president has discussed capital punishment in 2018:  In an address to the FBI National Academy in December 2017, Trump said, “We believe that criminals that kill police officers should get the death penalty” and was met with applause from the crowd. A year later, at a Department of Justice conference, he made a similar statement. “We will protect those who protect us…And we will believe the right punishment, and we all do, for cop-killers, is called the death penalty.” During a March 1 summit on the opioid crisis, Trump mused that perhaps the United States should adopt the death penalty for opioid dealers. “If you shoot one person, they give you life, they give you the death penalty,” Trump said. “These people can kill 2,000, 3,000 people, and nothing happens to them.” In August, Bloomberg reported that Trump was pushing Jeff Sessions to seek a death sentence for those who sell fentanyl, a pain medication that has contributed to the nation’s vast opioid crisis. Then, in December, Trump touted a deal that he hopes will curb the supply of fentanyl from China. In a tweet, he added: “If China cracks down on this ‘horror drug,’ using the Death Penalty for distributors and pushers, the results will be incredible!” In October, after a mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh left 11 dead, Trump told reporters before a campaign rally that he hopes the death penalty comes back “into vogue.” “Anybody that does a thing like this to innocent people that are in temple or in church, we had so many incidents with churches, they should really suffer the ultimate price.” He suggested that we should “bring back” capital punishment and “stiffen up our laws in terms of the death penalty.” According to Mayor Bill Peduto of Pittsburgh, Trump called him shortly after the shooting and spoke in similar terms—calling for harsher capital punishment laws as a way to prevent such violence. Peduto was stunned, and he told the Washington Post that he quickly ended the call. Trump couldn’t help but invoke the death penalty again when rolling out his administration’s three-part plan to address the opioid crisis in March. In a speech to announce the plan in New Hampshire, Trump said that drug dealers shouldn’t be treated “nice anymore” and recommended getting “tough on the drug dealers…and that toughness includes the death penalty.” His comments didn’t come out of the blue—the month prior, Axios reported that Trump had privately praised Singapore’s use of the death penalty for drug offenses, telling one official, “You know, the Chinese and Filipinos don’t have a drug problem. They just kill them.” By March, it was a public talking point. A few days after the New Hampshire speech, Trump called again for the death penalty for drug dealers at a stop in Pennsylvania, crediting China and Singapore for the idea. “I don’t know if this country’s ready for it,” he said. “The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness.” It wasn’t all bluster—Trump’s official plan to tackle the opioid epidemic reportedly included the death penalty for drug dealers. Of course, a president’s statements on the death penalty legally amount to more than one man calling for executions on the internet. In September 2018, the defense attorneys for Sayfullo Saipov—who, inspired by Islamic State propaganda, steered a pickup truck into a Manhattan bike path, killing eight—cited a Trump tweet from November 1, 2017, that reads, “NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room. He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!” They argued that the tweet was grounds to stop federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty because their bosses’ boss’ tweets make it impossible for a death penalty prosecution to be free of “nakedly political considerations.” Trump’s attitude has translated to policy changes, too. In October, the Associated Press reported that Trump’s Department of Justice was increasingly seeking capital punishment—during his tenure as attorney general, Sessions approved at least a dozen death penalty prosecutions. In Obama’s early years, Attorney General Eric Holder approved similar numbers. But by 2017, the administration was reviewing lethal injection protocols and only sought the death penalty once, in the prosecution of Dylann Roof.

University of Oregon provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list What makes some images memorable and others easily forgotten? It’s a question I’ve been studying for nearly 20 years. Estimates suggest that more than 1 trillion photos were taken in 2018. With so many in circulation, it’s difficult for any single photo to capture our attention and become a famed iconic image. In the golden age of photojournalism, news photographs became iconic largely because they appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world – think Iwo Jima and the Hindenburg. But that age has come to an end: Digital journalism and social media have changed the way we consume images. Each day, audiences are bombarded with photos. Many are shocking, inspiring and heartbreaking. But in their overwhelming volume, they’re easily forgotten. Nonetheless, some do rise to the top. Two colleagues and I developed a model to help predict when and how certain images may become widely known. The model shows that certain characteristics of an image – such as its timeliness, its cultural resonance, its political potency or its likelihood of being turned into a meme – can influence its rise and reach. Images that exhibit these qualities can quickly go viral, turning them into what communication scholars call “instant news icons.” While these images don’t typically endure to become truly historic, they nonetheless help citizens navigate and understand complex events. So which images did this in 2018? On Feb. 14, a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people and injuring 17 others. Following such a mass shooting, there’s a predictable pattern of news media coverage – breaking news reports filled with speculation, details about the perpetrator, elected officials responding with “thoughts and prayers” and debates about mental health and gun control. But after the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, we saw something new: images of resistance. The students there spoke fervently, demanding action from elected officials. These images of resistance spurred school walkouts and nationwide protests, culminating in the March For Our Lives. Forest fires continued to rage in 2018. During the devastating Carr Fire that burned more than 200,000 acres and claimed the lives of three firefighters, Redding, California resident Richard Tuggle captured a photo of five firefighters resting in a backyard in his neighborhood on July 27. The firefighters were clearly reeling from the exhaustion of battling the deadly fire. What’s particularly interesting about this photo and its rise to prominence is that it was captured by a citizen rather than a journalist. The photo went viral on social media and was ultimately picked up by news outlets across the country, showing how instant news icons can come from citizens as well as journalists in this new age of photography. Amid controversy and protests, the Senate narrowly confirmed Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court on Oct. 6. The contentious confirmation hearings pitted the image of an incensed Kavanaugh against images of impassioned protesters standing in solidarity with a calm, composed Christine Blasey Ford. In early October, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared. The Saudis initially denied that they had anything to do with his disappearance. But security-camera footage emerged showing Khashoggi entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. It served as evidence to support the claim – later confirmed – that he was killed inside. In this case, the image was captured by a security camera, rather than a photographer. Nonetheless, it became an instant news icon. It’s just another example of the changing nature of the production and consumption of news imagery. Time magazine named journalists as their 2018 Person of the Year, partly in response to the Khashoggi killing. A devastating war in Yemen has led to economic instability and widespread food shortages. On Oct. 26, The New York Times published photojournalist Tyler Hicks’ gut-wrenching images of starving Yemeni children. A few days later we learned that Amal Hussain, the 7-year-old girl in Hicks’ haunting photo, had died. Journalists have continued to document this humanitarian crisis. In mid-December the Senate voted to end U.S. military support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen. But the crisis continues, and millions of people still face starvation. Political, economic and ethical debates about immigration dominated the year, with two photos driving the conversation. Getty photographer John Moore’s image of a 2-year-old Honduran girl in a pink shirt sobbing as U.S. Border Patrol agents searched her mother became the face of Trump’s “zero tolerance” family separation policy. The image was even modified for a Time magazine cover under the headline “Welcome to America.” The image continued to spur discussion after it was made clear that the mother and daughter were not actually separated. However, hundreds of other children have been separated from their parents and recently a 7-year-old girl in Border Patrol custody died. Then, on Nov. 25, Reuters photojournalist Kim Kyung-Hoon snapped a picture of a mother and her twin daughters fleeing tear gas at the border wall between the U.S. and Tijuana, Mexico. Appearing in news outlets and on social media feeds across the country, it spurred further public and political outrage. Some said the photo effectively contradicted Trump’s narrative that refugees were dangerous. Others noted that the photo evoked the iconic image of a naked Vietnamese girl screaming in pain following a napalm attack. Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

297,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/589305334/0/phoenix/nation~men-arrested-in-shooting-at-fake-gender-reveal-party/,"CINCINNATI – More than a year after a mass shooting at a gender reveal party in Ohio, police announced the arrests of three men who have been charged in the death of one and the shooting of eight others, including three children. The three men indicted by a Hamilton County grand jury Dec. 11 in connection to the death of Autum Garrett and the shooting of others are: Roshawn Bishop, 28, two counts murder, two counts felonious assault and attempted murder. He has been incarcerated at the Mansfield Correctional Institution since February on charges of drug trafficking and a weapons violation. James Echols, 23, aggravated murder, aggravated burglary, two counts murder, nine counts felonious assault, eight counts attempted murder and cruelty to animals. He was arrested Christmas Day and is being held in Franklin County, Ohio. Michael Sanon, 21, aggravated murder, aggravated burglary, two counts murder, nine counts felonious assault, eight counts attempted murder and cruelty to animals. He is being held in Franklin County, Ohio, on multiple charges of burglary, safecracking, theft of vehicle and drug possession. Police say the shooting on Capstan Drive in Colerain Township was drug-related and it was planned. Untangling misinformation and following the evidence to the point of arrest took 17 months. Both Echols and Sanon are Columbus residents. Bishop previously lived in Hamilton County. July 2017: Woman who hosted her own gender-reveal party where 9 were shot wasn't pregnant, police say July 2017: 911 call captures chaos after shooting after gender reveal party Last year, Echols was named as a suspect in a homicide in Columbus – which according to Columbus police happened the day after the Colerain mass shooting. In the Columbus incident, a 19-year-old man was fatally shot and a 20-year-old woman was wounded. Echols was arrested in August 2017, according to news reports, but court records indicate that he was never formally charged. Colerain Township Police Chief Mark Denney said the investigation into the July 8, 2017, shooting was complicated. Some of the victims were not cooperative and police spent time following information from victims that was not true. People gathered for a supposed gender reveal party for Cheyanne Willis, who was 21 on the day of the shooting. Willis told the media that she lost her fetus after being shot in the thigh. But a week later, police announced Willis had admitted she was not pregnant. ""There were a lot of things we initially believed that turned out not to be true. It hindered the investigation, no doubt about that,"" said Denney. What was true was speculation that drugs were involved, he said. In fact, police eventually determined they were dealing with witnesses who had connections to more than one drug ring. ""From the very beginning of this investigation, we met significant resistance that is uncommon from victims of crime wanting a resolution,"" Denney said. Killed in the shooting was Garrett, 22, of Andrews, Indiana. Garrett's husband, Bryan, and two children also were shot. Bryan Garrett was struck in the eye. Officials didn't give details on the children's injuries. Police did say there were no indications the Garrett family was connected to the drug activity that sparked the shootings. It was a case of wrong place, wrong time. Nov. 27: U.S. border Patrol agent sparked $8M Arizona wildfire with gunshot at gender-reveal party Sept. 13: Gender reveal: Only her hairdresser knew for sure An 8-year-old boy also was wounded, according to police reports. Also shot and wounded were Morgan Bradley, 24, Willis, 21, Elijah Clemons, 26, who was Willis' boyfriend and lived at the house, and her mother, Lori White, 51. The family's dog also was shot and wounded. Police were told the party started at 4 p.m. and about 30 people attended. By 10 p.m., most of them were gone and a movie flickered in the dark living room as the remaining kids and adults – about a dozen in all – watched a ""Spider-Man"" movie. A little after 11 p.m., two men armed with handguns entered the house through an unlocked door, according to police reports, and began spraying the living room with bullets. Police said at least 14 rounds were fired. Garrett, who was Willis' cousin, was killed on the couch where she sat. She and her family had earlier that day attended a wedding. Police arrived less than five minutes after the shooting began, finding a front yard filled with people screaming for help. Witnesses told police the shooters did not say anything or demand property during the incident. They said the shooters entered, fired, then ran away. Investigators found a pistol in the front yard that police determined belonged to the homeowner. Willis was involved in a publicized incident that happened on Christmas Eve 2015 near a shopping mall. Willis was beaten and had her hair cut off. The attacker also wrote on her face. Video of the incident, which stemmed from a car robbery, was posted to social media. A woman and a man were arrested in connection with that case, but a grand jury ignored the charges and the two were never prosecuted. Clemons, 27, has been convicted of drug crimes. Two months before the shooting he was accused of aiming a gun at a woman who was changing a baby's diaper. A Hamilton County grand jury did not issue an indictment.

The 18-year-old activist and Parkland shooting survivor received national attention following the massacre that killed 17 of his classmates. Since the mass shooting, Hogg has blamed gun rights in America for the tragedy and has been outspoken in support of gun control since then. (RELATED: New Book ‘#Duped’ Shoots Down All Of Hogg’s Rhetoric) Thank you all for the well wishes, I’ll be attending Harvard in the fall with a planned major in Political Science. — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) December 22, 2018  I love y’all so much ???????????????? — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) December 22, 2018  Hogg organized the “March For Our Lives” protest that took place in March 2018, where more than a million people protested for gun control in Washington, D.C. Hogg took a gap year during the 2018-19 school year to campaign for liberal candidates during the midterms. Hogg was accepted into Harvard, despite scoring a 1270 on his SAT and having previously been denied entrance into schools such as UCLA and UC Irvine. Hogg’s acceptance is likely to bring more attention to Harvard’s admissions practices that have been criticized as discriminatory and un-meritocratic. Harvard is currently being sued after allegedly discriminating against Asians in favor of other minorities and white people with lower test scores. The decision provoked conservative criticisms of Harvard’s political bias. 75% of Harvard students score over a 1470 on their SAT with the bottom 25% averaging just over 1400. You really need over a 1470 to be considered. David Hogg’s SAT score was 1270. He was denied to UCLA, UC San Diego, and UC Irvine, where a 1240 places you above average. https://t.co/wfpQkHOCxA — Caleb Hull ????????????????

The letter, addressed to the Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who is the chair of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, outlined changes the department has adopted since the Feb. 14 shooting, including additional training and language changes that make officers' response to shootings less ambiguous. Part of the change says an officer responding to a shooting ""shall"" intervene in a situation in order stop the attacker, according to the letter, which was obtained by NBC News. Previous language, according to the Miami Herald, said an officer ""may"" intervene. The new policy also includes an updated list of priorities for officers responding to a shooting scene: “Deputies responding to active threat(s) incidents shall attempt to protect the life of innocent persons through immediate tactical intervention to eliminate the threat. In such scenarios, the prioritization of activities in order of importance will be: 1. Stop the active assailant(s); 2. Rescue the victims; 3. Provide medical assistance; 4. Arrest suspects and preserve the crime scene."" The new policy notes rare exceptions to this rule. ""While deputies are expected to tactically intervene, there may be very limited extenuating circumstances when entry by a solo deputy must be delayed until the situation changes, or additional deputies or resources are present,"" it reads. Additionally, since the Parkland shooting, the nearly 1,400 Broward Sheriff's Office deputies have completed 8 hours of additional, scenario-based ""active shooter"" training, according to the letter. ""Be assured, the reforms adopted to date are not the end of this process. Rather, they are a midway point we continue working towards addressing all of the findings related to our agency and implementing all of the Commission’s recommendations,"" the letter reads. Ryan Petty, a commissioner on the safety panel and the father of Alaina Petty, 14, who died in the Valentine's Day shooting, has called on Israel to resign, saying the sheriff's leadership has been a failure. Petty told NBC News on Wednesday that Israel was the person who originally wrote that officers ""may"" enter an active shooter situation, rather than ""shall."" ""It’s an admission of responsibility without coming out and saying, 'I made a mistake,"" and leaders admit mistakes,"" Petty said of Israel's reversal. Petty, who said he hadn't seen the entire document sent by Israel, said the number of deputies who did not engage with and ultimately stop the gunman is reflection on the previous poor policies. ""This should have been in place before Feb. 14,"" he said. The letter also notes that an internal investigation has been launched into Sgt. Brian Miller and Deputy Edward Eason. Earlier this year, body camera footage showed that both men delayed entering the building where the shooter had opened fire, according to the Associated Press. The officers were suspended last month, according to the AP, but in documents from Broward Sheriff's Office dated Dec. 4, it appeared both men have since been placed on restrictive administrative duties. Former MSD student Nikolas Cruz, now 20, has pleaded not guilty to the shooting, although his lawyers have said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Hundreds of volunteers will help answer the phones from children around the world calling for Santa when the program resumes on Monday, Dec. 24, 2018, for the 63rd year. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley, File) The government may be partially shut down, but that won't stop hundreds of volunteers dressed in Christmas hats and military uniforms Monday from taking calls from children around the world who want to know when Santa will be coming. The military says the NORAD Tracks Santa won't be affected by the government shutdown because it is run by volunteers Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado and is funded by the Department of Defense's budget that was approved earlier this year. Now in its 63rd year, the Santa tracker became a Christmas Eve tradition after a mistaken phone call to the Continental Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1955. CONAD, as it was known, had the serious job of monitoring a far-flung radar network for any sign of a nuclear attack on the United States. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When Col. Harry Shoup picked up the phone that day, he found himself talking not to a military general, but to a child who wanted to speak to Santa Claus. A Colorado Springs newspaper had run an ad inviting kids to call Santa but mistakenly listed the hotline number. Shoup figured out what had happened and played along. The tradition has since mushroomed into an elaborate operation that attracts tens of thousands of calls every year. For the 1,500 civilian and military volunteers who will answer the phones for kids calling 1-877-HI-NORAD, it infuses the holiday with childlike wonder. ""They're all really sweet, small voices,"" said Madison Hill, a volunteer who helped answer the phones in two previous years. ""I had a little girl tell me good night instead of goodbye,"" she said. ""It's really sweet."" The North American Aerospace Defense Command — a joint U.S.-Canadian operation based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that protects the skies over both countries — has taken over the Santa tracker since the tradition started. The military command center embraced and expanded the Santa-tracking mission and has been rewarded with a bounty of goodwill and good publicity. Last year, NORAD Tracks Santa drew 126,000 phone calls, 18 million website hits, 1.8 million followers on Facebook and 179,000 more on Twitter. It takes 160 phones to handle the calls that pour in. New volunteers get a playbook that briefs them on the questions kids might ask. Big screens on the walls show a Santa icon making blistering progress around the globe. U.S. and Canadian officers do live TV interviews from the phone rooms. ""It really gets you into the Christmas spirit,"" said Hill, a student at Mississippi State University who got involved through Air Force family members stationed in Colorado Springs. ""There are Christmas carols in the background, everyone's very friendly, happy to be there,"" she said. One year, she took a call from a boy who began reading a very long Christmas list. ""I remember having to cut him off after the 10th present or so,"" she said, explaining to him that she had to take calls from other children. A girl told Hill she wanted to warn Santa not to bump into a bell hanging on her door. ""I think she wanted Santa to be quiet and not wake her up,"" Hill said. Sometimes the volunteers have to handle the unexpected. In 2012, a child from Newtown, Connecticut, asked if Santa could bring extra toys for families who lost children in the mass shooting that year at Sandy Hook Elementary. ""If I can get ahold of him, I'll try to get the message to him,"" replied the volunteer, Sara Berghoff. NORAD's commander, Air Force Gen. Terrence J.

Admits hush payment Trump tweets that a hush payment to Stormy Daniels, “very common among celebrities and people of wealth”, “was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll [sic] in this transaction.” Child separations policy The Department of Homeland Security describes a new policy of child-parent separations at the southern border, which prompts widespread outrage. Fake doctor note Dr Harold Bornstein, Trump’s longtime doctor, says a 2015 note signed by him and describing Trump’s health as “astonishingly excellent” was dictated by Trump himself. “He dictated that whole letter. I didn’t write that letter,” Bornstein says. Withdrawal from Iran deal Trump announces that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions. Democrats call it a “senseless, disturbing and dangerous” move. Cancels North Korean summit Trump cancels a meeting with the North Korean leader planned for June with a letter that reads in part: “You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.” The Art of The Deal baby!!! https://t.co/fCrQVWc4Vy Admits reimbursing Cohen Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani reveals that Trump reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 he paid to Daniels. It will later emerge that Cohen submitted falsified invoices to the Trump Organization for reimbursement. Child separations The Department of Homeland Security reveals that 1,995 migrant children had been separated from their parents in the preceding six weeks. The Trump administration denies such a policy while Trump blames Democrats for “their forced family breakup at the Border”. Melania Trump visits a Texas shelter for unaccompanied children wearing a jacket with the slogan “I really don’t care. Do U?” Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at only three things, High Taxes, High Crime and Obstruction. Sad! Retreats on child separations Trump signs an executive order that will ostensibly end family separations at the border, although opponents criticise its vague language and warn that families can still be held in detention. The order makes no mention of whether families already separated would be reunited. Trump ‘charity’ sued The attorney general of New York state sues the Donald J Trump charitable foundation, Trump and three of his children for violating state charity laws, alleging that the Trumps used charitable assets as “little more than a checkbook for payments to not-for-profits from Mr Trump” and his companies. Meets Kim, and  declares end to nuclear threat Trump tweets after return from summit: Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future! Manafort to jail A judge orders former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort to jail following allegations by Mueller that Manafort was tampering with witnesses in his case. Manafort has been held in custody ever since. Orders ‘space force’ Trump directs the Pentagon to create a “space force” as a new branch of the US military. “We are going to have the air force and we are going to have the space force – separate but equal,” Trump says. “It is going to be something so important.”",2018-12-26 01:00:17,From ‘shithole countries’ to ‘a private agreement’ – Trump’s 2018 lowlights,"politics and government,books and literature,united states politics and government",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
304,https://www.denverpost.com/2018/12/22/laura-ingraham-david-hogg-harvard/,"Trending: In mid-December, Harvard’s early-entry candidates began logging onto the application status portal to learn whether they’d been accepted to one of the world’s most prestigious universities. But for one particularly famous member of the class of 2023, entry into Harvard brought a bit more than congratulations. For David Hogg, it was the last laugh. “Thank you all for the well wishes,” Hogg tweeted Saturday morning. “I’ll be attending Harvard in the fall with a planned major in Political Science.” Hogg is one of the survivors of the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead. After the shooting, he became a founding member of Never Again MSD, a group that advocates for stiffer gun control laws. He helped organize The March for Our Lives for stronger gun violence prevention measures, which drew nearly 800,000 people to the nation’s capital. But the 18-year-old’s very public stance on gun control turned him into a target himself. His home was swatted. He’s been accused of being a crisis actor. And even typical teenager ups and downs have made national news. Hogg and Harvard didn’t immediately return messages on Saturday. In March, he told TMZ about his rejection letters he’d received from four California colleges, even as he organized a movement that was “changing the world.” Mocking Hogg’s comments, Fox News Host Laura Ingraham tweeted a story from a conservative news website that described the teen as a “Gun Rights Provocateur” – and said Hogg was whining. “David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it,” Ingraham tweeted. “(Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA . . . totally predictable given acceptance rates.)” Hogg took to Twitter, where his number of followers has surpassed 900,000. He compiled a list of 12 companies that advertise on Fox News’s “The Ingraham Angle.” In a matter of days, Ingraham lost more than a dozen advertisers, including Johnson & Johnson, Nestle, Hulu, Jenny Craig, Ruby Tuesday and Miracle-Ear. The move showed the influence that Hogg and the other survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting have gained – and companies fears about becoming collateral damage in polarizing controversies. Ingraham later apologized, but Hogg blasted the move as an insincere “effort just to save your advertisers.” “The apology . . . was kind of expected, especially after so many of her advertisers dropped out,” Hogg said on CNN. “I’m glad to see corporate America standing with me and the other students of Parkland and everybody else. Because when we work together, we can accomplish anything.” In rejecting Ingraham’s apology, Hogg accused her of being a perpetual “bully,” who should apologize to other people she’d wronged. That didn’t happen, but Hogg made no mention of it on Saturday. Instead, he tweeted his response to an overwhelming sea of congratulations.

In October, the migrant caravan started gathering in Honduras consisting of thousands of refugees. As they started walking north through Mexico, President Donald Trump deployed U.S. troops to the border and renewed his call for a border wall. In late November, the caravan reached Tijuana, Mexico near San Diego. There many of asylum seekers rushed the border, prompting confrontations with some border patrol agents.
President George H.W. Bush
President, war hero and lifelong public servant George H.W. Bush died Nov. 30 at age 94. Thousands descended to the U.S. Capitol to pay their respects to Bush as he lay in state in the rotunda. All living presidents attended the funeral at the National Cathedral in Washington D.C., which included an emotional eulogy by his son, former President George W. Bush.

In November, the Camp Fire became the deadliest wildfire in California history, burning more than 153,000 acres and killing 86 people in Butte County north of San Francisco. The entire town of Paradise was destroyed. The blaze was 100 percent contained on Nov. 25 and authorities are investigating whether Pacific Gas & Electric could have played a role.

306,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/27/stephen-curry-kyrie-irving-conspiracy-theories-nba,"Sports stars as varied as Stephen Curry and Andrew Flintoff have flirted with conspiracy theories. But they are guided by very human emotions Last modified on Thu 27 Dec 2018 17.07 GMT With Christmas Day just gone, it seems fitting that Steph Curry already has something he’d probably like to take back. Two weeks ago, the Golden State Warriors star gave the 24-hour news cycle an incredible gift during an appearance on The Ringer’s Winging It podcast. The show, which features the Atlanta Hawks’ Vince Carter and Kent Bazemore as hosts, styles itself as more of a hang session than a proper interview; the point is to give listeners a sense of conversations that players actually have when scoop-hungry reporters aren’t parsing their every word. For 70 minutes the Warriors sharpshooter played along as Carter recalled his experience playing with Curry’s father, Dell. Had you zoned out around the 45-minute mark, you may have missed the playful digression about dinosaurs sounds (“A bone don’t tell you what a sound is,” one player quips) that prompted Curry to suggest that the 1969 moon landing (and the five others that followed) never happened. Clearly, CNN’s forthcoming Apollo 11 documentary can’t get here fast enough for them.  The blowback to Curry’s throwaway thought was swift and strong. Nick Gurol, the Philadelphia science teacher who had pushed back against Kyrie Irving after the Boston Celtics standout claimed – while appearing on another NBA players’ podcast in early 2017, incidentally – that the world is flat, was crying foul all over again. Former Nasa spaceman José Hernández accused Curry of promoting “idiotic conspiracy theories.” But not all the reactions to Curry’s astronomical gaffe were so harsh (at worst, maybe it disqualifies him from starring in the long-rumored sequel to Space Jam…). Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine mostly laughed off Curry’s remarks: “I can’t imagine he really believes that,” he told TMZ. Nasa invited Curry on a tour of its Houston lunar lab, while retired astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent a record 520 days in space, visited with Curry and stressed the importance of scientific literacy. Ultimately, Curry apologized for his comments – which, he strained to note, were “obviously” made in jest. But his contrition didn’t sit well with Irving, who had only just walked back his flat-Earth claims in October. “There’s world hunger going on, there are political things going on,” Irving told a gaggle of beat reporters. “There are so many higher things on the totem pole of society that matter to human beings. But, hey, Curry says he doesn’t believe in the moon [landings]? It’s on CNN. And they say we’re just jocks, we’re just athletes. But it’s on your channel. We’re [thinkers] but you don’t want us to be that.” It used to be that conspiracy theorists hewed to a type. They wore tinfoil hats, babbled incoherently to themselves and, by and large, were little more than a nuisance to the onlookers with the curiosity or the compassion to engage them. But in the current post-truth era, where crowdsourced information has replaced peer-reviewed research and confirmation bias stands in for intellectual curiosity, the truthers congregate online to double down on old conspiracy theories (like the Earth being flat) and breathe life into new ones (like Hillary Clinton being a lizard person). Science can’t hold a candle to celebrity, and sports personalities seem keener than ever to stir the pot. The past year alone has seen ex-NFL tailback Reggie Bush trade anti-vax views with his 2.88 million Twitter followers, retired All-Star pitcher Curt Schilling dismiss one of the victims of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as a crisis actor, and even the former England cricket all-rounder Freddie Flintoff joined the flat-Earth movement. And while Irving – whose comments some say are satire anyway –is right to point out that there are more pressing matters to consider than whatever far-out notions that he and his fellow sports celebrities kick around in their safe spaces, he and Curry should know better than anyone the weight that their endorsements carries. If sports heroes can sell sneakers and sugar water, odds are they can pretty much sell anything. When the Seattle Seahawks’ Pete Carroll was reported to have confronted a former US Army general with popular 9/11 conspiracy theories, those truthers cheered the Super Bowl-winning coach for boosting their credibility. It makes you wonder how big the John Birch Society might be today if their commie-fighting followers on the 1984 Padres pitching staff had come along 25 years later. And if some of these ideas haven’t spoiled your family gatherings this holiday season, well, just give it time. Dr James Davis, an associate professor of psychology at Benedictine University, chalks up these flights of fancy to the human propensity to make meaning. “An evolutionary advantage to humans is that we are able to make causal links between events,” he tells the Guardian. “Our brains are so adept at this that oftentimes we will make causal links that don’t exist.” And when sports heroes do this, their young admirers are most likely to receive their conclusions as gospel. Gurol, the Philly science teacher, reckons “anywhere from half to 75%” of his class would believe “whatever [Curry] says.” It’s not just kids. Sports fans are another captive audience with an overactive imagination. Under the right circumstances, they could believe anything: that the NFL triggered the power outage that delayed Super Bowl XVLII to inject life into a game that was quickly turning into a blowout (“Ahh, Roger Goodell,” Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs told ESPN, “he always has something up his sleeve…); that a heavily favored New Zealand side was intentionally given food poisoning before the 1995 Rugby World Cup final, paving the way for South Africa’s breakthrough victory; that Sonny Liston took a dive against Muhammad Ali in 1965; that NBA commissioner David Stern rigged the 1985 draft for the struggling New York Knicks with a chilled envelope. Anytime things go against one rooting interest or the other, there must be an explanation. There must be a real story that just needs to be uncovered. Doubtless for some, the fact that even two highly intelligent men like Curry and Irving could get swept up in the conspiracy theory craze might seem the most far-fetched idea of all. But it makes perfect sense to Davis. In August, the Benedictine psychologist was the lead author of a study in the European Journal of Social Psychology that found African Americans to be vastly more likely than whites to endorse conspiracy theories; that’s partly because of their diminished status in society, and partly because of the all-too-real conspiracies that have been perpetrated against them – like the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, the cellular plundering of Henrietta Lacks and the ongoing water crisis in Flint, Mich. “If you live in a world where it is very plausible that there are all these conspiracies against you and your group,” says Davis, “then it’s less of a jump to be like, ‘well, the moon landing was a conspiracy.’” Flat Earths, faked moon landings, lizard people: there are objective facts to rebut these theories. And if athletes still aren’t buying it? That doesn’t make them nuttier than Christmas fruitcake. According to a 2014 study published in the American Journal of Political Science, “half of the American public consistently endorse at least one conspiracy theory.” If anything, it makes athletes just like the rest of us.",2018-12-27 04:30:17,Fake moon landings and a flat Earth: why do athletes love conspiracy theories?,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Others in Gary’s life, from family to other police officers, had similar stories to share in the days after he and Officer Eduardo Marmolejo were fatally struck by a train while searching for a suspect, said the Rev. Dan Brandt, a Chicago police chaplain. A crowd of more than 1,000 police officers, family members, friends and dignitaries listened to Brandt on Friday morning in St. Rita of Cascia Shrine Chapel on the city’s Southwest Side.  “He was that kind of person, always putting others before himself,” Brandt said at the funeral Mass for Gary. “I was told you could count on Conrad for anything.” As the sun rose Friday, police officers in their dress uniforms converged on the chapel to mourn Gary. Workers at a nearby car dealership tied white and blue balloons to car side mirrors to honor the officers. Schoolchildren and teachers lined a portion of the procession, many of them holding their hands over their hearts. The sidewalks leading to the church were lined with officers and bagpipers. It was a familiar scene to a department that already had mourned the loss of two other officers this year. On Nov. 19, Officer Samuel Jimenez, 28, was killed in a mass shooting at Mercy Hospital & Medical Center. On Feb. 13, Cmdr. Paul Bauer, 53, was fatally shot while chasing a suspect outside the Thompson Center. Chicago police Officer Conrad Gary known as devoted husband, father, protector Gary, 31, and Marmolejo, 36, were killed Monday night by a South Shore commuter train as they pursued a suspect onto the tracks after a shots-fired call near 103rd Street and Dauphin Avenue. Edward Brown, 24, appeared in court Thursday on firearms-related charges. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said during Friday’s service that their deaths added to an already difficult year for the city’s police. “They have brought tears to our eyes, sorrow to our souls and hurt to our hearts,” Emanuel said. “And as solemn as it is written, God heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. He counts the stars and calls them all by name.” Gary joined the Police Department in March 2017. He was assigned to the Calumet District after he had completed his training there. The district was supposed to have its holiday party Friday, but its officers instead spent the day mourning their two fallen colleagues. Gary grew up in suburban Oak Lawn, graduated from Eastern Illinois University in 2009 and had spent more than five years in the Air Force, much of that time deployed in Germany. He and his wife, Kelly, were just starting a family and have a 6-month-old daughter, Tess. Officer Jeffrey Curia, a field training officer, said after the Mass that he saw promise and strides toward greatness while training Gary. The two were able to apprehend a suspect in a burglary. “He showed he wanted to make the city a better place,” Curia said. “I believed in him. I believed he would be an important part of the Police Department.” Curia’s assessment echoed remarks made by Brandt during the Mass. Gary already was becoming known as an officer in the Calumet District who was quick to provide backup to other cops. At the Chicago police academy, Gary was a “go-to” person who helped classmates, Brandt said. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson described Gary as having a sense of duty that compelled him to help others. In his remarks, Johnson detailed the last moments of Gary’s life. Gary and Marmolejo climbed a steep embankment as they searched for evidence and for a suspect in the shots-fired call. “They were determined to get an illegal weapon off the streets of Chicago,” the superintendent said. “That’s what police do. Their only concern was getting the gun off the streets.” Johnson said it was rare to hear Gary curse and that he frequently treated his partner to coffee. But Gary’s wife told Johnson it wasn’t because he was a big spender but because he had a year’s worth of coffee coupons, Johnson joked. “That’s how he was buying all that coffee,” the superintendent said. It was one the few lighter moments of a solemn ceremony during which officers were seen giving hugs to one another during Communion. Cardinal Blase Cupich concelebrated the Mass and offered condolences to police officers. He encouraged the crowd to reflect on the importance Gary placed on relationships, pointing out how photos shared so frequently showed him with someone rather than alone. “We need to be present to one another in this city,” Cupich said. “To make sure that no one feels alone, particularly in the depth of their sorrow, their pain and their loss.” The winter solstice, with the longest night of the year, coincides with the night between the funerals for Officers Gary and Marmolejo, Cupich said. But he pointed out that the sun always slowly returns, and Cupich offered Gary’s baby daughter, Tess, as a sign of hope. He told the crowd to look for signs of Gary in his daughter in the years ahead. “The way that she will smile and walk but also the way in which generosity will spontaneously and almost naturally spring in her heart,” Cupich said. “For they will be a reminder that he lives on in her, but also as people of faith that he lives on as he stands before the Lord today, the risen Lord who gives him life, and that same Lord welcomes him into a day in which the sun will never set.”  After the funeral, Tess was covered in a light pink and blue blanket. An officer cradled her outside St. Rita as officers presented Gary’s wife with two flags.  Many officers from other departments, including Illinois State Police Director Leo Schmitz, and retired Chicago officers attended the funeral.  Pat Learnahan was a Chicago officer for two decades and said he attended because he wanted to pay his respects.  “Four killed this year, it’s horrible,” he said. “I’ll do my best to be at all these trials.”   “And that’s just not a statement. ... Until the day we die, we’ll do what we can to take care of those families and help those children grow up as they lost their fathers in this case.” The wake for Marmolejo took place Friday evening. His funeral was scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday at St. Rita. Marmolejo had been on the force for 2½ years and was the father of three young children. rsobol@chicagotribune.com kgalioto@chicagotribune.com emalagon@chicagotribune.com MORE COVERAGE CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2018-12-21 22:10:00,Funeral held for 1 of 2 Chicago police officers killed by train: 'You could count on Conrad for anything',police,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/

""We are going to change the law.’’ The last mass shooting? In a nation with about one a day? In the hours and days after 17 people were killed Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, many of the student survivors were adamant: Gun control, as becalmed a movement as any in politics, would now defeat the mighty gun rights lobby. The students didn’t know you weren’t supposed to politicize a tragedy. Their hashtag motto summed up their hope and their hubris: NeverAgain. Rarely had such intense idealism faced such entrenched opposition, or had political rhetoric soared so high and promised so much. ""This generation is the generation of students you will be reading about next in the textbooks,’’ one student, Cameron Kasky, said when NeverAgain announced a national bus tour. “These are students who are changing the game.  &mldr  We can fix the political system.’’ The students vowed to register traditionally apathetic young people to vote; to force the federal government to tighten gun laws, and to force the states to do so even if Congress would not; to defeat in November even the most senior elected officials backed by the National Rifle Association. But the students did not anticipate that they would become celebrity culture heroes. “I had no idea there were high school students with such eloquence, such poise and such moral clarity,’’ wrote Georgie Anne Geyer, a veteran commentator. “I am humbled by the hope they give me.’’ To understand what became of such hopes after that bloody Valentine’s Day, consider this calendar of events. 2/14: In his address to the nation after the Parkland shooting, President Donald Trump promises to ""tackle the difficult issue of mental health."" He does not mention guns. 2/15: Vermont Gov. Phil Scott reiterates his opposition to tightening the state’s gun laws. 2/16: After learning of a plan by an 18-year-old to attack a school in Fair Haven, Vermont, Scott reverses course and says he’s open to new gun laws. 2/17: At a Fort Lauderdale rally, Gonzalez recites familiar arguments against tighter gun laws and leads the crowd in a refrain – ""We call B.S.!"" By day’s end she’s trending on Twitter, although she has no account herself. 2/18: Gonzalez signs up for Twitter and tweets her first tweet. 2/20: At the state capitol in Tallahassee, Parkland students, some in tears, watch the legislature vote down debate on a control bill filed before the shooting. 2/21: On a visit with other Parkland students to the White House, Sam Zeif — who lost his best friend in the shooting — makes a tearful plea for gun control. ""How is it that easy to buy this type of weapon? How did we not stop this after Columbine? After Sandy Hook?’’ he says, placing his hand on the shoulder of a mother whose son died in the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting six years earlier. • Kasky, a founder of the NeverAgain movement, tweets that he’s gotten off Facebook: “There’s no character count, so the death threats from the @NRA cultists are a bit more graphic than those on twitter.’’ 2/22: Florida U.S. senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson join several Parkland students at a CNN Town Hall. Kasky tells Rubio, “it’s hard to look at you and not look down a barrel of an AR-15 and not look at Nikolas Cruz. &mldr’’ Kasky asks Rubio if he’d stop accepting money from the NRA. When Rubio demurs, Kasky persists. Rubio says ""I will always accept the help of anyone who agrees with my agenda."" • South Dakota lawmakers table a pair of proposals to allow people to carry concealed firearms without a permit. 2/23: U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican who holds an “A” grade from the NRA, announces support for gun control measures, including a federal ban on assault weapons sales. While he supports the Second Amendment, he writes in an op-ed piece, ""it does not guarantee that every civilian can bear any and all arms."" 2/26: Gonzalez now has nearly twice as many Twitter followers as the NRA — 955,000, compared to the 584,000 the NRA has gained since joining Twitter in 2009. 2/28: Dick’s Sporting Goods says it will stop selling assault rifles as a result of Parkland. 3/1: Numerous corporate sponsors — including Hertz, Avis, Met Life and Allied Van Lines — severed links to the NRA, which calls such moves a ""shameful display of political and civic cowardice."" 3/6: Gun control activist Lucy McBath, who lost her teenaged son in a shooting in 2012, enters the race in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. She says she decided to run in outrage over Congress’ failure to act after Parkland. 3/9: Florida Gov. Rick Scott signs the first gun control legislation since the Parkland shooting. It tightens gun laws in several ways — including raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 from 18 — but also allows some teachers in school to be armed. 3/9: In Wadesboro, North Carolina, a gunman kills three people and injures another at a restaurant and bar. In Yountville, California, a man enters a veterans home and kills three staff members before fatally shooting himself. 3/13: The Idaho legislature overwhelmingly approves a “Stand Your Ground” law, which says people have no duty to retreat when they’re defending themselves, their property or other people. 3/18: Parkland student Alex Wind, interviewed on 60 Minutes, says “we are the generation that’s had to be trapped in closets, waiting for police to come, or waiting for a shooter to walk in. &mldr We are the people that know what it’s like, firsthand.’’ 3/22: TIME magazine cover features Parkland #NeverAgain student leaders Gonzalez, Kasky, Wind, Jaclyn Corin and David Hogg. 3/23: Trump signs off on the “Fix NICS Act,” which penalizes government agencies for not reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for firearms. The White House supported the measure over one supported by the NRA that would have also expanded the right to carry concealed weapons. 3/24: NeverAgain’s March for Our Lives in Washington, and other cities across the globe attracts a crowd of more than a million. Protesters call for universal background checks on all gun sales; raising the federal age of gun ownership and possession to 21; reviving the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban; and a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines and bump stocks (which make it easier to fire rounds from a semi-automatic weapon by harnessing the gun's recoil to ""bump"" the trigger faster). Meanwhile, thousands of students in schools across the nation walk out for 17 minutes — one for each Parkland victim. 3/28: Fox TV host Laura Ingraham tweets: “David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance rates.)’’ When Hogg complains and lists her sponsors, several cancel their ads and condemn Ingraham for targeting a high school student. 3/29: As sponsors cancel ads on her show, Ingraham publicly apologies to Hogg “for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland."" 4/9: Rep. Ron DeSantis, a leading Republican candidate for Florida governor and self-described “Second Amendment guy,” says he’d have vetoed the state gun control law passed after Parkland. 4/11: In Vermont, Governor Scott signs a law raising the age to buy firearms, banning high-capacity magazines and making it easier to take guns from people who pose a threat. It’s the first significant gun ownership restrictions in the history of the largely rural state. 4/20: In Kansas, a bastion of gun rights, GOP governor Jeff Colyer signs a bill that will make it a crime for people recently convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense to have a firearm. ► SHOOTING IN ANTIOCH, TENNESSEE 4/22: A gunman kills four people at a Nashville-area Waffle House and wounds two others. 4/24: Maryland’s GOP governor Larry Hogan signs legislation that establishes an Extreme Risk Protection Order, or red flag law, that bans gun possession by people considered dangerous to themselves or others. • Parkland students are the stars at TIME magazine’s gala for its “100 Most Influential People’’ issue. Celebrities and spectators gravitate toward González and her classmates, although she herself says the person she really wants to meet is comedian Trevor Noah. 5/2: Students at schools across the nation walk out of classrooms for 16 minutes to support the Second Amendment. ""Stand for the Second"" is the idea of Will Riley, a Carlsbad, New Mexico, high school student. He says he watched the Parkland students say that gun control “is what kids are asking for. And I'm thinking, 'I'm not asking for that.’ I look at my friends and I think, 'They're not asking for that.'’’ 5/11: Citing opposition from the business community and law enforcement, Oklahoma GOP governor Mary Fallin vetoes a bill to allow people to carry guns without permits. The measure had easily passed both houses in the legislature. ""This temporary setback will be rectified when Oklahoma residents elect a new and genuinely pro-Second Amendment governor,"" says NRA’s legislative affairs chief. ► SHOOTING IN SANTA FE, TEXAS 5/18: A student shoots and kills 10 people and wounds fourteen others at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. 5/25: Hogg leads a “die-in’’ at two Publix stores in Parkland to protest the grocery chain’s support of pro-NRA gubernatorial candidate Adam Putnam. Publix says it’s suspending and reviewing its political contributions. 5/30: Based on discussions after the Santa Fe High School shooting, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott releases a school and gun safety plan that includes a request that the legislature consider “red flag” laws. 6/1: Rhode Island’s governor signs red flag legislation that had bogged down before Parkland, partly because of objections by civil libertarians. They’d argued that firearms shouldn’t be confiscated unless the owner is at least alleged to have committed a crime. 6/4: A day after graduation, Parkland students announce a summer national bus tour to register young voters and press for gun control. Gonzalez: ""We're trying to help stop this before it comes to other places.’’ Among the stops: Orlando, site of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting; Aurora, Colorado, site of the 2012 theater shooting; Las Vegas, site of the 2017 country music festival shooting; Charleston, South Carolina, site of the 2015 bible study shooting; Blacksburg, Virginia, site of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting. 6/5: In California’s non-partisan primary, first time candidate Harley Rouda barely secures the second spot on the general election ballot behind 14-term incumbent Dana Rohrabacher, a strong NRA ally. 6/11: A national pro-gun rights tour organized by the Utah Gun Exchange, an online firearms business, will make stops to coincide with the Parkland students’ Road to Change events. The group will drive a military-style armored vehicle with a replica machine gun that sounds like the real thing. Exchange co-owner Bryan Melchior says more guns equals more safety. • The Naples Daily News reports that Florida's two GOP gubernatorial candidates are sticking to their guns. Adam Putnam and DeSantis remain solid NRA allies. ""This is the issue they probably have the least separation on,"" says Brad Herold, a DeSantis advisor. 6/15: The Road to Change bus tour starts in Chicago. With celebrities like Chance the Rapper and Jennifer Hudson, Parkland students join an annual peace march and rally on the South Side. A local organizer says the crowd is much larger than in previous years. Hogg later tells the New York Times that “all of a sudden, now that we showed up, there were 10,000 people instead of 500.” 6/19: Publication of ""#NeverAgain: A New Generation Draws the Line"" by Hogg and his sister and fellow Parkland survivor Lauren. It will become a best seller. 6/20: Road to Change visits U.S. Rep. Steve King's office in Sioux City, Iowa, to protest the arch conservative’s stand on guns and history of racially charged statements. González denounces King and accuses him of racism. King ignores the protests. ► SHOOTING IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND 6/28: A gunman kills five employees at the offices of The Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, and wounds two others. 7/3: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rules out tighter federal gun laws. He tells a crowd in Kentucky that there’s very little Congress can do to prevent tragedies such as Parkland, except provide money for school security. 7/11: A Salt Lake City area movie theater complex revokes an agreement to allow the Road to Change tour to hold an event there, saying it “appears to be escalating into a potentially contentious situation” between opposing forces on gun control. 7/14: Road to Change’s Salt Lake stop is switched to a hall in the town of Sandy. About 30 people protest outside. Some hold signs quoting the Second Amendment, and others carry handguns on their hips. The latter are barred from the hall. “I cannot protect my kids if they take my guns away,” one man tells the Salt Lake Tribune. 7/16: Illinois’s Republican governor Bruce Rauner, a hunter and self-described Second Amendment advocate, signs a law with a red flag provision that also extends the 72-hour gun-purchase waiting period to all firearms, not just handguns. 7/19: Rabbi Jeffrey Myers posts a message on the website of the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. After Parkland and other mass shootings and ""despite continuous calls for sensible gun control and mental health care, our elected leaders in Washington knew that (the issue) would fade away &mldr Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the midterm elections, I fear that the status quo will remain unchanged."" 7/24: A federal appeals court rules that the Second Amendment protects the right to openly carry a gun in public for self defense. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rules 2-1 that Hawaii officials violated a man’s rights when he was denied an “open carry’’ permit. The decision reverses a lower court ruling that said the amendment only applies to guns in homes. • Hours after a Texas Senate committee considered red flag laws at the request of the governor, the state’s lieutenant governor — who presides over the Senate — suggests that any such bill would not pass in the next legislative session. He says that while the panel considered the proposal at the request of the governor, the governor “has since said he doesn’t advocate red flag laws."" 8/1: The NRA increases membership fees for the second time in as many years. “Without this dues increase,” the NRA says of the hike from $40 to $45 for an annual membership, “we simply can’t compete in the 2018 elections.’’ 8/15: Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High students return for a new school year. There are new metal detectors and security cameras. ► SHOOTING IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA 8/26: A 24-year-old video game player shoots and kills two people, and then himself, at a tournament for players of the football video game Madden in Jacksonville, Florida. 8/28: The gun control group founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords kicks off a campaign to elect sympathetic candidates with a $1 million cable TV ad buy against U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, a northern Virginia Republican. The NRA has spent $137,232 on Comstock’s behalf since she was elected in 2014. 9/4: Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the Parkland massacre, approaches pro-Second Amendment Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at his Senate confirmation hearing and extends his hand. Kavanaugh turns away without shaking. The White House later says that was because a security officer intervened. 9/5: Virginia politicians typically shun the issue of gun control, but The Washington Post says it could be a deciding factor in the tight race between Barbara Comstock and Democratic challenger Jennifer Wexton. ""I think it started when the mass school shootings started,"" says Elaine Lynch, 42, who voted for Comstock in 2014 but will vote for Wexton in November. ""People were afraid. Parents sent their kids to school praying that they'd come home."" SHOOTING IN CINCINNATI, OHIO 9/6: A gunman kills three people at the Fifth Third Center skyscraper in Cincinnati before being shot to death by police. 9/19: Kasky leaves NeverAgain. The high school senior says that in retrospect he’s been too partisan – as at the CNN town hall. “I went into that wanting less conversation and more to embarrass Rubio,” Kasky tells Fox News Radio. He says he met people during the summer Road to Change tour with different political beliefs than his, and he came away wanting to understand more about them. Now he’ll work “on some efforts to encourage bipartisanship or at least discussion that is productive and help a lot of people avoid the mistakes that I made.” ► SHOOTING IN BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA 9/13: A gunman kills five people at three locations in Bakersfield, California, before committing suicide as police close in. ► SHOOTING IN ABERDEEN, MARYLAND 9/21: An employee kills three people at a Rite Aid distribution facility in Aberdeen, Maryland, before shooting herself in the head. She later dies in the hospital. 9/26: An Associated Press review of state firearms-related legislation passed this year shows a mixed record. Gun control bills passed in a number of states, but the year was not the national game-changer for which gun-control advocates had hoped. Legislatures fell back to predictable — and partisan — patterns. 9/28: House Republicans cancel all votes for October and leave for home with two weeks left on their October schedule to campaign before the midterm elections. No gun control measures have even been considered since the Parkland shooting. 10/18:  A Kaiser Foundation poll finds that a majority of voters in areas with competitive elections say health care is “very important” in making their voting decisions for Congress. At least a quarter choose health care as the “most important issue.” 10/24: DeSantis releases a robo-call recording with an endorsement by Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed in the Parkland attack. Pollack suggests a DeSantis victory will “ensure that no parent loses their child in a school shooting again.” He also calls DeSantis’ opponent, Andrew Gillum – who pledged not to accept money from the NRA — “dangerous for Florida.’’ 10/25: Former New York City mayor and gun control advocate Michael Bloomberg announces a $4 million donation to Harley Rouda’s PAC in his California race against Dana Rohrabacher, helping to make that the year’s most expensive House election. 10/26: Filings with the Federal Election Commission show that, in a reversal of history, gun-control advocates have outspent gun-rights groups by more than 40% on next month’s congressional elections. Gun-control groups, including  Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety, have spent $20.2 million, compared to $14.1 million by pro-gun groups, led by the NRA. • NeverAgain’s “Vote for Our Lives” bus tour, designed to register young voters in time for the election, kicks off in Minneapolis. ► SHOOTING IN PITTSBURGH, OHIO 10/27: An avowed anti-Semite kills 11 and injures six, including four police officers, in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. •  Corin, 18 today, casts her first election ballot in early voting in Parkland. 10/29: The Pentagon says it’s sending at least 5,200 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort to prevent members of the migrant caravan from illegally entering the country. 10/31: Everytown for Gun Safety announces more than $700,000 in TV ads against Colorado GOP U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman, accusing him of taking “more NRA PAC money than anyone in Colorado’s congressional Delegation.” 11/1: Gonzalez has 1.6 million Twitter followers. 11/5: Vote for Our Lives tour arrives in Tallahassee three days after a gunman kills two women and injures five others at a yoga studio. Standing outside the historic Old Capitol, Gonzalez says: “Vote in every election like it’s your last, because it could be.’’ 11/6: Election Day. About two-dozen House candidates backed by NRA or known as gun rights supporters are defeated, according to Giffords, including Coffman in Colorado and Comstock in Virginia. Giffords says 88 of 129 candidates it backed won, including Lucy McBath in Georgia. Corin tweets, ""We're not going anywhere, @NRA."" But at watch party in Parkland, she tells The Guardian, “I’m shaking with anger’’ at loss of the Florida governorship and U.S. Senate seat to DeSantis and Scott, both gun control foes. 11/7: NRA celebrates victories in U.S. Senate races in Florida, Texas, Tennessee, North Dakota and Indiana. ""ThankYou to all @NRA members who got out and voted,"" the group tweets. 'You are the most powerful force in American politics, and we will never stop fighting against the anti-gun elitists bent on destroying our Second Amendment freedoms."" ► SHOOTING IN THOUSAND OAKS, CALIFORNIA • A gunman kills 12 people, including a policeman, at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, that’s hosting a student line-dancing event. He then kills himself. 11/10: AP calls House election in California district for Rouda over Rohrabacher. ► SHOOTING IN CHICAGO 11/19: A gunman kills four people in a shooting at Mercy Hospital in Chicago, one of the day’s several mass shootings. POSTSCRIPT Despite Gonzalez’ prediction, NeverAgain has not substantially “changed the law’’ on guns. States this year approved more than 50 gun control measures, including laws to keep guns from dangerous people, among them those convicted of domestic violence; to increase background checks on gun sales; to restrict concealed carrying of guns; and to ban the use of bump stocks. This month the Trump administration also issued a federal regulation banning bump stocks. But there was no significant federal legislation. None of the major goals of the March for Our Lives was realized, and gun control did not become an issue on which most voters based their decisions. In Florida, only 10% said gun policy was important to their vote, compared to 25% who mentioned health care and immigration. It’s too early to know if 2018 was a turning point in the politics of guns, or merely a dramatic standoff. It certainly left the NeverAgain students with an appreciation for how hard change comes, if it comes at all. This is only the start, Hogg told reporters: “It’s going to be a long road.’’                                        ",2018-12-26 08:32:04,After Parkland shooting: A day-by-day fight over guns in America,"education and schools,politics and government,gun control,firearms,demonstrations and riots",25128,http://www.azcentral.com

312,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/589388746/0/phoenix/local~Prison-time-mental-illness-drugs-all-commonalities-in-Phoenix-police-shootings/,"The year of the police shooting started with two shots in the back. On a cloudy morning 10 days into 2018, Phoenix police radios crackle with reports of hit-and-run wrecks and an errant produce truck near 48th Street and Broadway Road. The driver, 31-year-old Isadore Deshon Byrd, jumps from a wrecked box truck and holes up in a good Samaritan's GMC pickup parked nearby. Body-worn camera footage shows Officer David Dehority and others with Phoenix police screaming orders at Byrd for more than six minutes as he fidgets around the driver's seat. ""Out of the car!"" they shout. ""Put your hands up!"" ""He may be getting ready to run,"" Dehority says. ""Got a stun-bag?"" In an instant, the door swings open. Byrd steps out, and a BB gun in his right hand raises toward Dehority. Pop goes the officer's gun. Byrd makes a 180-degree turn and runs — apparently raising the gun behind him and giving cause to shoot, according to police. Pop. Pop it goes again. Byrd hits the asphalt as officers run toward him with their guns drawn. One asks where he was hit. The other steps on Byrd's outstretched arm. They lift the man's black-checkered hoodie, examine his stomach and find no signs of blood. An officer checks Byrd's pockets before even seeing where he was hit. They see the answer when they roll him onto his side: twice in the back, where blood soaks through his sweatshirt. ""He was angry at that time,"" investigators who reviewed the shooting said of the suspect. ""Byrd said he was having problems in a relationship and did not want to live anymore. He purposely pointed the BB gun at the officer, and he was shot. Byrd admitted he was high on methamphetamine and was drinking."" That quote, from a nearly 100-page police report, captures some of the broad themes from the 44 Phoenix police shootings this year — a number that shattered records, generated national attention and spurred an outside review. Phoenix police officials blame the surge on increasingly violent people in the city. MORE: Group issues travel warning in midst of record-breaking year of police shootings Activists have called cops trigger-happy and demand investment in communities. An analysis by The Arizona Republic shows prison history, mental illness and recent drug use were commonalities in Phoenix's soaring number of shootings. Those factors are consistent with research looking into police shootings nationally, said Michael White, a professor and policing researcher in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Arizona State University. But that alone can't explain why Phoenix police fired more times than any other agency its size in the United States, prompting outside investigations, he said. “I think the police have gotten much better, rather than worse, in dealing with those things,"" White said, referring to improved police interactions with community members. ""That makes me think that there's something unique going on here."" Phoenix, the country's fifth most-populous city, has had 44 police shootings so far in 2018, more than any of the country's four largest cities. The New York City Police Department, the largest in the country, covering a city of 8.5 million, had 13 police shootings through November, a spokesman told The Republic. As of Dec. 10, Los Angeles and Chicago had 31 shootings, and Houston had 16. Phoenix's total is significantly higher than the combined tally of 30 from the three most-similarly populated cities, Philadelphia, San Antonio and San Diego. They have recorded 12, 12 and six, respectively, The Republic found. Phoenix police were involved in 21 shootings in 2017. Facing public backlash and demands for information, Phoenix in November launched an online data page that catalogs its police shootings. Among the key takeaways as of Dec. 28: Officials said the aggregate data and information was in the name of transparency — a common refrain from Chief Jeri Williams and demand from community activists that has been met with resistance. Other agencies publish police shooting narrative details, as in Philadelphia, and video footage, as in Los Angeles. Phoenix has not announced plans to do anything similar, despite driving Maricopa County's shooting tally to 81 this year, also a record. Of the shootings it has reviewed so far countywide, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office has deemed each of this year's shootings justified. No officers have been criminally charged. Nearly one in three police shootings in Phoenix — at least 12 this year — involved suspects who had spent time in an Arizona prison, The Republic's analysis of shooting investigations, court documents and prison records found. The total number of previously incarcerated suspects could be higher. It is difficult to determine if any of the suspects spent time in other prisons across the United States because no all-encompassing easily searchable database exists that reliably captures such information. Some of those convicted, incarcerated, released and later shot by Phoenix police officers were involved in drug or drug-related crimes decades ago. Others served time for more violent offenses. The amount of time out of prison varied from decades to days. Steven Patrick Scheuer, 49, was released from the Arizona Department of Corrections on March 19 after serving nine years for aggravated DUI, prison records show. When he got out, he built a shed in his older sister's backyard and called it home. Seven weeks later, on May 6, Scheuer's sister called police to report her brother had been having drug-induced hallucinations, ""acting strangely"" and was walking around the neighborhood with a knife, according to police reports. She wasn't sure what drug he was using, but he was talking about construction lumber being in the trees and machines underneath them. She said it was like how he acted 20 years earlier after using methamphetamine. The first call ended amicably. But officers were called again that night about an erratic Scheuer armed with a knife and wandering the streets near 43rd and Missouri avenues. On the way there, officers talked about how they could detain him and get him a mental-health evaluation. When they arrived, Scheuer was holding a staple gun. He walked toward officers, who demanded he drop it. Scheuer obeyed, but then he pulled out a knife about 6 feet from the officers, raised it above his head and walked toward them, according to police reports. One officer pushed him back before retreating to a palm tree for cover. Scheuer continued toward them and, two shots later, he fell to the ground. After a scuffle, officers arrested Scheuer on suspicion of aggravated assault. Assault charges have been filed, and he is slated to stand trial in January. A prison sentence is likely. MORE: Activists decry Phoenix police shootings as 'epidemic of violence' In other cases with previously incarcerated people, the dynamics ranged from defined mental-health crises with those who never fully fit into society, to some who seemed borderline successful before falling back on criminality. Andres Arteaga, 28, spent three years in the Arizona Department of Corrections for, among other reasons, fleeing a traffic stop and fighting with police. Arteaga, who was released in October 2017, missed an August court date. A judge issued a warrant for his arrest, and plainclothed officers found him two days later near 15th and Southern avenues in Phoenix. After a foot chase through the neighborhood and a flubbed stun-gun attempt to subdue him, officers fatally shot Arteaga as he reached for a gun. Before he went to prison in 2014, investigators wrote to the court that Arteaga had a history of drug use and wanted treatment. Childhood abuse, parents who were incarcerated and drugs contributed to his delinquency, investigators said. His younger sister wrote on Facebook that she often felt like an older sibling. They weren't especially close after he was released from prison. But she took solace in knowing that he cared for her — sentiment captured in a voicemail from him that she posted on Facebook after his death. ""Hello, sister. I just want to wish you a happy birthday,"" Arteaga said in the recording. ""I love you with all my heart."" Mental illnesses — specifically suicidal thoughts or statements — were part of at least one in five of the shootings, based on Phoenix police reports that have been released for 2018 shootings and reviewed by The Republic. It's likely a much more prominent and far-reaching factor that simply isn't captured in official documents. Crises that ended in police shootings sometimes coincided with the most grisly crime scenes this year. In February, Edward Hallinan was the focus of one of them. The 39-year-old Phoenix man had been using methamphetamine and cocaine, believed people were trying to kill him, and made comments about ""wanting to delete himself,"" records show. His mother grew concerned he was developing a mental illness. On Feb. 20, she called a crisis hotline, and workers conducted a home-visit evaluation, ultimately recommending he get a neurological evaluation. He seemed responsive, but that quickly changed. The next day, Hallinan armed himself with an MP-15 rifle, fatally shot three people whose bodies were found in an adjacent yard and holed up in a nearby pickup truck. After a standoff with officers, Hallinan fired two shots and police returned fire. His body was pulled from the pickup and the Maricopa County Medical Examiner determined he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. It was one extreme case in which someone's mental health was called into question before mayhem unfolded — and where the systems that existed failed to prevent violence. Estimates about the prevalence of so-called ""suicide-by-cop"" vary widely. Some researchers say it explains about 10 percent of police shootings, while others cite it as a factor in about one-third of cases. Records released thus far about Phoenix's shootings point toward the latter. Phoenix police officers in March were investigating an argument near 59th Avenue and Osborn Road and got into a ""running gunbattle."" David Gardea, 27, smoked marijuana and drank a pint of vodka before telling his girlfriend ""I love you"" as the cops arrived and the shooting commenced. She later said he confided in her that he planned to ""take himself out"" if the police ever came for him again. In April, a transgender woman who was transitioning from male to female made suicidal statements and ""wanted to end it,"" according to police reports. After shooting a gun inside her home, prompting a police response, 44-year-old Alexis Stinson shot at responding officers who returned fire, killing her. She, too, had made previous statements of self-harm. One of the most controversial police shootings this year played out over 24 hours. Alexandre J. Aldrich barricaded himself in a motel room in June and threatened to burn the place down. He claimed to be a federal investigator and hallucinated that he was surrounded by 20 people inside the room. Aldrich had a previously diagnosed mental illness, but family members said he had refused to get treatment. Officers were called and left without incident, but they were called back the next day. While handcuffing 34-year-old Aldrich on suspicion of trespassing, the man pulled away and began to swing the arm with the cuff toward an officer. A fight followed in which an officer punched him and deployed the stun gun with ""little to no effect,"" according to police reports. With one handcuff on his wrist and the other hanging open, Aldrich kicked free and turned toward the officer. Concerned that the open handcuff could cut his throat, the officer fatally shot Aldrich. His body-worn camera fell off during the scuffle, according to police. Elected officials have taken note of residents' demands for a greater emphasis on, and communication about, mental-health training among police officers. City Council members in a December meeting called for a report detailing officer training on mental health, from new recruits going through the police academy to officers participating in new training modules. Williams said the topic was top of mind as an increasing number of calls, including those that do not end in violence, involve people with mental illness who might also be using drugs. She has lauded crisis intervention training her new officers receive and said she is working on a program to get mental-health experts more involved in dispatching and responding to emergency calls. “The mental-health issue isn’t lost on us at all,"" Williams told the council. ""We’re working hard to bridge those gaps in the system.” Joel Carson walked into a Phoenix Circle K on May 9 ready to kill and be killed. The 53-year-old man with a lengthy rap sheet of felony convictions spent the previous night smoking crack cocaine and stabbing his neighbor, police reports show. With the gun he stole from his wounded neighbor, Carson walked into a Circle K near 18th Avenue and Grant Street and went to the checkout line. There, he stood behind a stranger, raised a gun to the back of the stranger's head, and pulled the trigger. The man crumpled, and Carson turned to the shoppers who ducked for cover. ""This is not a game. This is not a joke,"" Carson announced, according to police reports. ""I don't want no money, don't want no beer. I came prepared to die!"" He pointed the gun at patrons and pulled the trigger. But nothing happened. Customers seized the moment and tackled Carson. Snipers set up outside fired through the glass, hitting him before taking him into custody on suspicion of multiple counts of assault and a single count of murder. Investigators in their reports painted a picture of a homicidal man on a mission to kill. They captured his cold demeanor. ""I told Joel the victim from Circle K had a wife and kids,"" an officer wrote. ""I asked him what he would say to them if given the chance, and he replied, 'He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.'"" Investigators examined the handgun and found eight remaining bullets. Each had been hit by the firing pin, but the bullets didn't go off because the cylinder was out of alignment. If not for that malfunction, Phoenix could have had a mass shooting this year. It's cases like these that law enforcement officials have used to explain the surge in police shootings this year. Some members of the public, officials have said, have been increasingly violent toward spouses, neighbors, strangers and officers. Those people have stolen cars at gunpoint. They have been wanted for murder. In one case, a man allegedly crept to within 10 feet behind an officer, aimed a gun at his head and said ""freeze, motherf****r."" The officer spun, fired and took the man into custody. The spike in police shootings coincides with a recent uptick in violent crime in metro Phoenix, FBI data show. Year over year, the rate of violent crime per 100,000 Phoenix residents jumped to 761 in 2017 from 674 in 2016. That reverses years of downward trends but isn't a significant departure from other major cities. Williams, though she has cited a surge in assault on officers, pushed back against claims that Phoenix residents are inherently more aggressive in a radio interview earlier this month. ""We're not uniquely violent,"" she said. Police shootings are among the most polarizing events in law enforcement. They also generally face the most significant scrutiny, compared with the thousands of other police encounters every month, more than 99 percent of which do not end in violence. The reams of paperwork are voluminous, from internal reviews to determine if the shooting was within policy to criminal homicide inquiries and findings presented to county prosecutors. Despite the reinforced web of checks and balances, every case in which a review has been completed this year in Phoenix has ended the same way: within policy and without criminal charges. Not captured in the data, and perhaps impossible to capture in Phoenix police's backlogged records system, is the number of times an officer peacefully resolves standoffs with those in crisis — including in cases in which a police shooting technically might be deemed justified. Williams has come out hard against critics who say her officers have acted aggressively and are unnecessarily escalating already volatile encounters. She also cited an increase in assaults on officers as an equally — if not more — troubling aspect this year. ""While I cannot account for the reasons why some members of our community take active aggression against officers, I can encourage and create opportunities for additional training,"" Williams wrote in a statement to the community in August. ""The safety of our community and officers is the foundation of this department."" It is unknown how many suspects in police shootings have been formally charged with assaulting officers, and how that number compares with past years. The Republic filed a records request for the data in early October, but the County Attorney's Office has not provided the information. Some of the spike in reported assaults on officers could stem from changes in reporting practices. A police department spokesman in late November said Williams had no time available to accommodate a follow-up interview with The Republic, as she was focused on police shootings and addressing 2019 priorities. She was ""booked up the few days remaining this year,"" he said Nov. 29. The spokesman referred a reporter to ""numerous interviews"" Williams provided through the year addressing the spike in shootings. Her most recent at the time was in August, after Officer Adrian Cruz, 27, was shot and wounded during a north Phoenix traffic stop. “This is happening all over the city,"" Williams said in that interview. ""This is happening with different ethnicities and genders. This is happening with different types of weapons and firearms, and you name it. So there’s not one thing. It’s an alarming trend.” Two weeks after reportedly being ""booked up,"" Williams responded in radio and television interviews to a New York Times article on Phoenix police violence. Williams has addressed the uses of force more subtly at Phoenix City Council meetings, usually before the council authorizing the department's purchase of thousands of dollars in equipment. MORE: New York Times article 'misrepresents' shootings, Phoenix police chief says She has generally opted not to offer input about what might be behind the unusual year and leaned on a  $149,000 council-approved, taxpayer-funded study. The National Police Foundation has been meeting with department personnel and collecting reports to suss out what trends exist that the department might have missed. Preliminary findings from that investigation were planned by the end of the year, although that report has been delayed until early 2019. White, the researcher, said shootings and police encounters more broadly should be viewed like a chess match. Likening interactions that might end in shootings to a match where each player makes and anticipates moves, he said, can lead to a deeper understanding of what might be done differently to change the outcome. ""It gets away from looking at, 'Was the person armed at the time he or she got shot?’ to a broader focus,"" he said. ""What decisions did the officer make and the citizen make throughout the encounter that either increased or decreased the likelihood that deadly force was going to have to be used?"" Viridiana Hernandez, executive director of neighborhood activist group Poder in Action, has led an effort against police violence and city leaders she says are complicit in the shooting surge. Hernandez and others have called for a halt in increased police funding. Instead of giving police new guns, technology and equipment, the group wants to see a greater investment in their communities — places where people fear the police and have a dearth of resources, primarily for drug and mental-health treatment. “It’s the lack of mental-health resources, the lack of economic opportunities, the lack of basic necessities to live,"" Hernandez told The Republic. ""For us, all of those are factors for what lead people to a moment of crisis.” Protesters took over public comment portions of City Council meetings, including an especially boisterous one Dec. 5 that the mayor quickly shut down. The group has protested at council chambers in recent months and unfurled banners from freeway overpasses and a downtown parking garage decrying the shootings. The most significant spike in shootings happened in Phoenix City Council District 4, spanning the central and western parts of the city represented by Laura Pastor. Twelve shootings happened there in 2018, compared with two in 2017. Through a spokesman, Pastor acknowledged the increase in shootings in her district but called attention to the citywide surge. ""She is committed to identifying and dedicating existing and new resources to address this issue where available,"" the spokesman said. District 5, which includes parts of western Phoenix represented by Councilwoman Vania Guevara, also saw a sharp uptick, with six police shootings in 2018 where there were none the year prior. Guevara said the focus in 2019 needs to be finding groups that are doing ground-up community work, revitalizing west Phoenix neighborhoods and re-engaging the community. ""I think it’s more of a holistic approach that we need to take on and talk about what safety looks like,"" she told The Republic. ""We all need to be at the table."" Seeking a solution, Hernandez pointed to a recent move by elected leaders in Minneapolis to siphon more than $1 million from the police department's budget and instead fund broader public-safety efforts. The effort, which did not subtract from the number of sworn personnel, was aimed at paying for youth outreach, conduct review and a program that pairs officers with mental-health professionals. Hernandez and law enforcement actually have that concern in common. They're both critical of police being expected to handle all of society's most volatile emergencies, from people acting violently to people experiencing a crisis. Using police and incarceration as the only solution unfairly and dangerously expands their role, Hernandez said. And through time, policing has been seen as the only answer for safety. ""For us,"" she said, ""these are all social issues. These are not public-safety issues. They’re public health issues.” Officials hope the past 12 months were not the start of a new normal. Data trends suggest those hopes might be realized. The six-month stretch from March to August saw the vast majority — 76 percent — of the year's police shootings, records show. Law enforcement experts have said the increase in those months is typical each year. Williams has stopped short of saying that any single departmental change caused the number of shootings to slow in the final weeks of 2018. Time will tell, she said, whether this was simply an ""anomaly year."" Outside researchers are probing what other sociological factors might be steering people toward situations that end in police shootings, and efforts are ongoing to see what, if anything, needs to change inside the department. Meanwhile, Byrd, whose case started the year that came to be defined by police shootings, remains in a Maricopa County jail cell. Byrd has an eighth-grade education and was hearing voices Jan. 10 when he crashed a truck and engaged in a standoff with police. He was experiencing a bout of paranoia from what his attorney in court papers said is an ""undiagnosed mental illness."" Shot twice in the back, Byrd was rushed to a hospital where doctors performed surgery and kept him alive. He'll face a judge and jury in a trial scheduled for Jan. 22.

314,https://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Why-Trump-s-bump-stock-ban-won-t-stop-mass-13479333.php,"Bump stocks such as this one, which can make a semiautomatic gun fire like an automatic weapon, have been banned by the Trump administration. Try as we might, it’s hard to get too excited about the Trump administration’s ban on bump stocks, the type of device a gunman added to his weapon to give it the rapid firepower needed to kill 58 people during a mass shooting in Las Vegas last year. President Donald Trump certainly deserves credit for fulfilling the promise he made to ban bump stocks after the Oct. 1, 2017 massacre in Nevada. The ban alone, however, won’t prevent a similar tragedy from occurring. That will take sterner measures that address the actual weapons used to kill people, not just the devices that make those weapons more lethal. As many as 520,000 bump stocks may be attached to guns owned by Americans, according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, but the ATF admits that’s only a guess. Many of the devices are untraceable because they don’t have serial numbers. The people who own bump stocks are unlikely to fess up and turn them in, which is what the new Trump rule requires them to do. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker signed a regulation Tuesday that gives gun owners 90 days after it is published in the Federal Register this week to turn in or destroy their bump stocks. After that, it will be illegal to possess them under the same federal laws that prohibit machine guns. It should surprise no one that the National Rifle Association is opposed to the new rule, saying bump stocks shouldn’t be regulated as if they were guns. That’s actually the same view the ATF took in 2010. Asked for its approval by a bump-stock manufacturer, the ATF said gun laws didn’t apply to the device because it “has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed.” Trump pounced on that earlier opinion by an Obama administration agency when he promised last year to ban bump stocks. Congress, meanwhile, has done its usual job of talking loud and doing nothing when it comes to gun law reform. States that have already banned bump stocks provide little reason to believe the federal ban will be effective. Five months after New Jersey initiated a ban in January, not a single bump stock had been turned in. Massachusetts passed a ban in November 2017, but by February only three bump stocks had been turned in. California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington have also banned bump stocks. The ATF estimates that between 2011 and 2017 Americans spent $96.2 million on bump stocks, which can cost from $180 to $425 each. Mark Pennak, president of a Maryland gun rights group, says it’s unfair to confiscate bump stocks without compensating their owners. “You’re criminalizing a plastic item, and sending people to prison for three years for it,” he said. His point might carry more weight if bump stocks had not been used by the killer in Las Vegas to mow down 58 people in a little more than 10 minutes. The gunman used multiple weapons outfitted with target scopes and bump stocks and then fatally shot himself. Fourteen of the 23 assault-style weapons recovered in his Mandalay Bay hotel suite were fitted with bump stocks. The ban means bump stocks can no longer be sold. Unfortunately, however, given the number of bump stocks in circulation, the Las Vegas massacre may not be the last time one is used by a mass murderer. Meanwhile, there are YouTube videos on the internet and books available on Amazon that teach you how to make a semiautomatic gun, which fires one shot with each pull of the trigger, operate like a rapid-firing automatic weapon. When are the president and Congress going to address the actual guns favored by mass murderers that, with or without bump stocks, can rain death on a crowd? They didn’t do anything after Sandy Hook. They didn’t do anything after Parkland. It has taken more than a year for the promise Trump made after the Las Vegas massacre to come close to being fulfilled. The rule won’t actually take effect until March. The children and adults who have died in mass shootings deserve better than that. So do the families and friends they left behind. A bump stocks ban may be something, but it’s not nearly enough.",2018-12-19 20:00:00, Why Trump’s bump stock ban won’t stop mass murders [Editorial] ,"finances,gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders",10,http://www.chron.com/
315,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/us/california-today-thousand-oaks-mass-shooting-afghanistan.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by California Today By Jill Cowan Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) It’s been a difficult year for California. Deadly wildfires devastated communities up and down the state. And yet another mass shooting punctured a place that felt like a refuge. My colleague Jennifer Medina wrote about a young man who survived the shootings in Las Vegas and the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks and is now preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. I’ll let her tell you more about meeting the young man, Brendan Kelly: Before the shooting last month, Thousand Oaks was perhaps best known for its reputation as one of the safest cities in America. So I was hardly surprised when Brendan Kelly described his childhood as idyllic. But now, at 22, Mr. Kelly has  experienced more mass violence than anyone should face in a lifetime. First, he was in Las Vegas last year, when 58 people were killed at a country music festival. As he recovered, he spent countless nights at Borderline. Just as things were really feeling back to normal for him, a gunman entered Borderline and killed 12 people there. He seems to approach danger — and even death — in the most matter-of-fact way. To memorialize two of his closest friends who were killed last month, he tattooed their names on his back, along with something a friend told him as they left Las Vegas: “In this game of life, no one makes it out alive.” In just a few days, Mr. Kelly will head to Afghanistan for his first tour of duty as a Marine. As I spent time with Mr. Kelly and two of his friends who also survived both mass shootings, it was impossible not to be struck by the incongruence of their peaceful childhood with the carnage they have seen in the last 14 months. They each speak about the way Thousand Oaks has embraced them, with friends and strangers trying to offer comfort and support. But they also know what is painfully obvious: Nobody could have imagined this. It has been hard for anyone to truly understand. As Mr. Kelly spent his final days in California before his deployment, I tried to understand just how the shootings have shaped him, both haunting him and propelling him forward. He never considered postponing his service overseas. His father worries that only once he is there will he fully begin to grapple with what he has already been through.

The Parkland, Fla., shooting came nearly two decades after 13 people died at Columbine High School, five years after 27 mostly elementary school students died in Newtown, Conn., and months before 10 students died at Santa Fe High School in Texas.
In Parkland, the teen survivors were not satisfied with everyone's ""thoughts and prayers."" Declaring, via hashtag, #Enough and #NeverAgain, they rallied. Students around the world joined them. Policymakers, parents and celebrities supported them.

RELATED Parkland panel advises arming teachers to handle school attacks
In the months since the Parkland shooting, 27 state legislatures passed 67 gun-control laws, the most in a single year since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, an analysis from the Giffords center indicates. The number is more than three times the 20 measures passed in 2017, The New York Times reported.
Of the gun-control measures passed, nine aim to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, eight targeted bump stocks and other devices that increase firing speed, eight were extreme risk protection orders in which firearms can be confiscated from at-risk individuals, seven increased background checks, six tightened concealed carry laws and eight provide funding to urban gun violence prevention programs.
New Jersey passed the most measures, including a six-bill package previously vetoed by former Gov. Chris Christie. New Gov. Phil Murphy signed an extreme risk protection order act and laws on background checks, concealed carry permitting and magazine capacity.

In Florida, where students marched on the Capitol, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a $400 million package of legislative reforms for school security, mental health and gun control. The legislation banned the use of bump stocks, increased the minimum rifle purchasing age from 18 to 21, and instituted a three-day waiting period on all firearm purchases.
A Democratic attempt to include an amendment banning all assault weapons was unsuccessful.
Oregon was the first state to enact gun restrictions after the Parkland shooting, banning firearm ownership for people convicted of domestic violence, even if the victim isn't a spouse, closing the so-called ""boyfriend loophole.""
In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order allowing law enforcement agencies to consider ""all red flags, including recent threats of violence made in person, in videos and on social media and take all available legal steps to remove firearms from any person who poses a threat to themselves or others."" The state also banned bump stocks and passed an extreme risk protection order law.
In April, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott signed into law three bills that contain gun-control measures -- expanding background checks, banning bump stocks, limiting rifle magazines to 10 rounds and raising the age limit to buy firearms to 21. He also signed a bill to remove guns from people cited or arrested for domestic assault.

In Delaware, Gov. John Carney signed the Beau Biden Gun Violence Protection Act on April 30. Named for former Vice President Joe Biden's late son, the law allows police to seize weapons from those deemed a danger to themselves or others.
""This year, Americans of all ages and from all backgrounds demanded action from lawmakers to make communities safer from gun violence,"" Anderman said. ""Legislatures responded by standing up to the gun lobby's repeated attempts to weaken gun laws and listening to people who want progress on this issue. These victories build on the lifesaving bills we've helped pass over the past few decades and because of this momentum, more Americans in all areas of the country will be better protected from gun violence.""
On the federal level, President Donald Trump's administration announced Dec. 18 a ban on bump stocks.
The Giffords report, released Dec. 14, also said there was a drop in the number of measures loosening restrictions on guns after Parkland, a reduction by about half from 2017, from 19 to nine.
Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control group organized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said state lawmakers voted against 90 percent of legislation by the National Rifle Association. The organization also said it endorsed candidates in 43 midterm races against NRA-backed candidates, and 33 candidates who support gun-control won.

Of the gun-control measures passed, nine aim to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, eight targeted bump stocks and other devices that increase firing speed, eight were extreme risk protection orders in which firearms can be confiscated from at-risk individuals, seven increased background checks, six tightened concealed carry laws and eight provide funding to urban gun violence prevention programs. New Jersey passed the most measures, including a six-bill package previously vetoed by former Gov. Chris Christie. New Gov. Phil Murphy signed an extreme risk protection order act and laws on background checks, concealed carry permitting and magazine capacity.

RELATED March For Our Lives activists, others honored at Smithsonian awards In Florida, where students marched on the Capitol, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a $400 million package of legislative reforms for school security, mental health and gun control. The legislation banned the use of bump stocks, increased the minimum rifle purchasing age from 18 to 21, and instituted a three-day waiting period on all firearm purchases. A Democratic attempt to include an amendment banning all assault weapons was unsuccessful. Oregon was the first state to enact gun restrictions after the Parkland shooting, banning firearm ownership for people convicted of domestic violence, even if the victim isn't a spouse, closing the so-called ""boyfriend loophole."" In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order allowing law enforcement agencies to consider ""all red flags, including recent threats of violence made in person, in videos and on social media and take all available legal steps to remove firearms from any person who poses a threat to themselves or others."" The state also banned bump stocks and passed an extreme risk protection order law. In April, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott signed into law three bills that contain gun-control measures -- expanding background checks, banning bump stocks, limiting rifle magazines to 10 rounds and raising the age limit to buy firearms to 21. He also signed a bill to remove guns from people cited or arrested for domestic assault.

Named for former Vice President Joe Biden's late son, the law allows police to seize weapons from those deemed a danger to themselves or others. ""This year, Americans of all ages and from all backgrounds demanded action from lawmakers to make communities safer from gun violence,"" Anderman said. ""Legislatures responded by standing up to the gun lobby's repeated attempts to weaken gun laws and listening to people who want progress on this issue. These victories build on the lifesaving bills we've helped pass over the past few decades and because of this momentum, more Americans in all areas of the country will be better protected from gun violence."" On the federal level, President Donald Trump's administration announced Dec. 18 a ban on bump stocks. The Giffords report, released Dec. 14, also said there was a drop in the number of measures loosening restrictions on guns after Parkland, a reduction by about half from 2017, from 19 to nine. Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control group organized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said state lawmakers voted against 90 percent of legislation by the National Rifle Association. The organization also said it endorsed candidates in 43 midterm races against NRA-backed candidates, and 33 candidates who support gun-control won.

317,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/arts/alice-walker-david-icke-times.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Alexandra Alter In a statement addressing the widespread outrage over her praise for a book with anti-Jewish overtones, the novelist Alice Walker called its author “brave enough to ask the questions others fear to ask” and denied that he was anti-Semitic. The remarks, published on her website, came several days after a New York Times interview in which she called “And the Truth Will Set You Free,” by David Icke, “a curious person’s dream come true.” Jewish groups and many others condemned Ms. Walker for supporting the book and The Times for publishing the interview. Ms. Walker, author of the acclaimed novel “The Color Purple,” did not back down in her statement, saying that the book was not anti-Semitic. “I do believe he is brave enough to ask the questions others fear to ask, and to speak his own understanding of the truth wherever it might lead,” she wrote. Ms. Walker’s response did little to dispel the controversy that erupted after she gave an enthusiastic endorsement of Mr. Icke, a British conspiracy theorist. “There is no fair reading of Icke’s work that could be seen as not anti-Semitic,” Jonathan A. Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in an email on Friday. “Public figures should not be making excuses for Icke’s hatred; they should be condemning it.” In the book, Mr. Icke draws on ideas from the anti-Semitic pamphlet “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” argues that Holocaust denial should be taught in schools and that Jews are responsible for organizing anti-Semitic attacks, and calls the Talmud a racist document. In other writings, he has posited that a cabal of a child-sacrificing, bloodthirsty lizard people, many of whom are Jewish, are secretly running the world. Ms. Walker did not immediately respond to an interview request submitted through her literary agent on Friday. In response to an interview request to Mr. Icke, his son sent a link to a recording of a statement this week in which Mr. Icke denied being an anti-Semite and argued that the criticism amounted to “propaganda against me designed to discredit me and what I’m writing,” but went on to say that “some Jewish people are involved in a global conspiracy.” In last week’s By the Book column in The Times’s Book Review section, when Ms. Walker was asked which books she has on her nightstand, Ms. Walker cited “And the Truth Shall Set You Free,” saying that “in Icke’s books there is the whole of existence, on this planet and several others, to think about.” In the same answer, she also praised “The Road of Lost Innocence,” a book about sex trafficking in Cambodia by Somaly Mam, which was discredited in 2014 when it emerged that Ms. Mam had fabricated parts of her story. (Ms. Mam denied the charges but resigned from her namesake foundation after an investigation.) Readers who were aware of Mr. Icke’s extreme views and his role in spreading anti-Semitic tropes and ideas saw Ms. Walker’s recommendation as not only offensive, but as a dangerous endorsement of bigotry and hatred. Some critics said that in an environment where conspiracy theories have led to a rise in hate crimes and violence against Jews, and may have been a motivating factor behind the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, publishing an endorsement of such views without challenging them was irresponsible. “The only thing that is accomplished by uncritically disseminating Walker’s bigoted book bon mots is ensuring that the racism is disseminated to more people,” Yair Rosenberg wrote in Tablet. Mr. Rosenberg and others have noted that Ms. Walker has espoused such ideas before, praising Mr. Icke’s books on her blog, in a BBC interview, and posting a video of one of his lectures on her website. Critics also cited blatantly anti-Semitic language in her poetry, particularly one titled, “It Is Our (Frightful) Duty to Study the Talmud,” which includes the lines, “Are Goyim (us) meant to be slaves of Jews, and not only/ That, but to enjoy it?” But while Ms. Walker’s views were no secret, they hadn’t been subject to such intense public scrutiny before. For many readers, she is best known as a beloved figure in the literary world, a poet and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “The Color Purple,” which was adapted into a film featuring Oprah Winfrey and a Broadway show. Ms. Walker, 74, is also a longtime political activist and vocal feminist, known for her work with the NAACP and for taking stands on social justice issues. She has also been an outspoken critic of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, even comparing the country to Nazi Germany. Jewish groups including the Anti-Defamation League have been monitoring Walker’s talks and writing for years. In her website remarks, Ms. Walker said that both she and Mr. Icke were being attacked for supporting Palestinians and that “as a woman, and a person of color, as a writer who has been criticized and banned myself, I support his right to share his own thoughts.” “It is a sad day for freedom of inquiry, thought, and speech, when an attempt is made to frighten people into lying about what is on their nightstand,” she wrote. Many critics took issue not only with Ms. Walker’s views, but also the Times’s decision to publish her unqualified recommendation of an anti-Semitic book without critiquing the choice or asking any follow-up questions. In a letter to The Times, Mr. Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League said The Times had failed to put the recommendation in context. “Ms. Walker has a right to read what she will, but the Book Review has a responsibility to fact-check its material and forewarn readers if the book being recommended to readers is a conspiratorial polemic by a writer with a long history of scapegoating groups of Jews and blaming them for many of the ills of the modern world,” he wrote. In an interview with the Times’s Reader Center, the editor of the Book Review, Pamela Paul, said that the By the Book column was designed to shed light on a subject’s reading habits and to use books as a window into their views, and should not be construed as an endorsement of their choices. “When we interview anyone, whether it’s a public official or a foreign leader or an artist, The Times isn’t saying that we approve of the person’s views and actions,” she said. “We’re saying we think the subject is worthy of interviewing; that’s our approach with By the Book.” It remains unclear whether the controversy will tarnish Ms. Walker’s legacy, or shape the way readers and scholars approach her celebrated body of work, which also includes “You Can’t Keep a Good Woman Down” and “Finding the Green Stone.” Writing in Slate, the book critic Laura Miller argued that while The Times should have given readers contextual information to evaluate the book, the controversy did have one upside: “A lot more people know the ugly truth about Walker and Icke now.” Advertisement",2018-12-21 15:38:38,"Alice Walker, Answering Backlash, Praises Anti-Semitic Author as &#x2018;Brave&#x2019;",books and literature,1,http://nytimes.com
318,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/navy-times/news/your-navy/~3/Ef28Q9VyKcg/,"DENVER — The government may be partially shut down, but that won’t stop hundreds of volunteers dressed in Christmas hats and military uniforms Monday from taking calls from children around the world who want to know when Santa will be coming. The military says the NORAD Tracks Santa won’t be affected by the government shutdown because it is run by volunteers at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado and is funded by the Department of Defense’s budget that was approved earlier this year. Now in its 63rd year, the Santa tracker became a Christmas Eve tradition after a mistaken phone call to the Continental Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1955. CONAD, as it was known, had the serious job of monitoring a far-flung radar network for any sign of a nuclear attack on the United States. When Col. Harry Shoup picked up the phone that day, he found himself talking not to a military general, but to a child who wanted to speak to Santa Claus. A Colorado Springs newspaper had run an ad inviting kids to call Santa but mistakenly listed the hotline number. Shoup figured out what had happened and played along. The tradition has since mushroomed into an elaborate operation that attracts tens of thousands of calls every year. For the 1,500 civilian and military volunteers who will answer the phones for kids calling 1-877-HI-NORAD, it infuses the holiday with childlike wonder. ""They're all really sweet, small voices,"" said Madison Hill, a volunteer who helped answer the phones in two previous years. ""I had a little girl tell me good night instead of goodbye,"" she said. ""It's really sweet.""

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief. The North American Aerospace Defense Command — a joint U.S.-Canadian operation based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that protects the skies over both countries — has taken over the Santa tracker since the tradition started. The military command center embraced and expanded the Santa-tracking mission and has been rewarded with a bounty of goodwill and good publicity. Last year, NORAD Tracks Santa drew 126,000 phone calls, 18 million website hits, 1.8 million followers on Facebook and 179,000 more on Twitter. It takes 160 phones to handle the calls that pour in. New volunteers get a playbook that briefs them on the questions kids might ask. Big screens on the walls show a Santa icon making blistering progress around the globe. U.S. and Canadian officers do live TV interviews from the phone rooms. ""It really gets you into the Christmas spirit,"" said Hill, a student at Mississippi State University who got involved through Air Force family members stationed in Colorado Springs. ""There are Christmas carols in the background, everyone's very friendly, happy to be there,"" she said. A spirited Twitter spat between Air Force bases turned unexpectedly dark Wednesday when the Air Force’s official Twitter account dropped a bombshell: Santa isn’t real. One year, she took a call from a boy who began reading a very long Christmas list. ""I remember having to cut him off after the 10th present or so,"" she said, explaining to him that she had to take calls from other children. A girl told Hill she wanted to warn Santa not to bump into a bell hanging on her door. ""I think she wanted Santa to be quiet and not wake her up,"" Hill said. Sometimes the volunteers have to handle the unexpected. In 2012, a child from Newtown, Connecticut, asked if Santa could bring extra toys for families who lost children in the mass shooting that year at Sandy Hook Elementary. ""If I can get ahold of him, I'll try to get the message to him,"" replied the volunteer, Sara Berghoff. NORAD's commander, Air Force Gen. Terrence J. O'Shaughnessy, will also take a turn answering the phones Monday. ""This is my first NORAD Tracks Santa,"" said O'Shaughnessy, who took command in May. ""I'm really excited."" O'Shaughnessy was even asked about the program during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in April to confirm him as NORAD chief. ""I assume this committee can count on your commitment to continue that venerable tradition,"" Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton deadpanned. “Yes sir, especially since my son Sam would want to see that as well,” O’Shaughnessy replied.

321,http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/hillsborough-sheriff-calls-news-conference-on-death-investigation-in-plant-city-area-20181219/,"PLANT CITY — A Hillsborough County sheriff's deputy killed his wife, daughter and granddaughter early Wednesday morning, then confessed to their murders over his agency radio before killing himself. Terry L. Strawn, 58, a Sheriff's Office veteran who was once named Officer of the Year, used his service handgun to kill his family at two locations in east Hillsborough County. Three deputies encountered him near Plant City High School and tried to talk him down before he died by suicide. ""He indicated he was losing everything,"" said Hillsborough Sheriff Chad Chronister. ""I'm saddened. But I'm also disheartened that a sheriff's deputy would ever cause harm to another individual."" FROM SEPTEMBER: Deputy's wife texted 'Kirk has lost his mind' before murder-suicide, friend says The victims were identified as the deputy's wife, Theresa Strawn, 54; daughter, Courtney, 32; and his 6-year-old granddaughter, Londyn, who was Courtney Strawn's daughter. The youngest casualty was a student at Valrico Elementary School, where Strawn worked as a school resource officer. Sheriff's officials learned of the carnage at 6:42 a.m., when Strawn started speaking over a sheriff's radio frequency. He announced he had ""emergency traffic,"" then said he had killed three family members and gave directions to the two locations where they could be found, the sheriff said. The deputy said he planned to kill himself at Plant City High, which is near one of the murder scenes. A communications supervisor tried to talk him out of it. A short time later, deputies found Strawn just east of the school. They pleaded with him not to hurt himself. ""At one point he said he had to go, he wanted to be with his family,"" Chronister said. No students or school staff were in the area, officials said, when the deputy killed himself. Detectives and forensic technicians combed through three crime scenes Wednesday afternoon: An area just outside the Plant City High campus, Courtney Strawn's duplex near the school and the deputy's home in a gated community at 1512 Emerald Hill Way in Valrico. ""During his radio transmission, he talked about how much he loved the Sheriff's Office,"" Chronister said. Terry Strawn also spoke of coping with financial and health problems, the sheriff said, but no financial concerns surfaced during his recent pre-employment background check when the retired deputy returned to duty this past summer. In 2011, the deputy and his wife filed for bankruptcy protection in federal court. In a petition, they estimated their assets at less than $50,000 with liabilities greater than that. Among the assets, they listed a Jeep, two trucks, a boat, and a 9mm Smith & Wesson firearm. But court records show they qualified for a mortgage and bought a house earlier this year. Strawn started with the Sheriff's Office in 1991. State law enforcement records indicate he began as a jail deputy before joining road patrol in 1995. In 2004, he and another deputy shot and killed a man while responding to a domestic violence call. The man pointed a metal and plastic tool at the deputies as they tried to arrest him, according to news accounts of the incident. Fearing the object was a gun, the deputies fired their weapons. Strawn was named an Officer of the Year in 2009. Sheriff's officials cited his work in removing dangerous criminals from the streets. ""Deputy Strawn is persistent, leaving no stone unturned in his pursuit of the lawbreakers,"" then-Sheriff David Gee said. ""Recently he arrested a fugitive and an armed robbery suspect after a traffic stop. His high rate of success in the location and capture of numerous suspects has earned him this year's top honor in east Hillsborough County."" Strawn retired about two years ago, Chronister said. But he was re-hired over the summer as part of a sheriff's partnership with the Hillsborough County School District to improve security in local elementary schools. The program was created in response to a new law passed after February's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. The Sheriff's Office pledged to recruit and train more than 100 officers for elementary schools, providing 132 hours of comprehensive firearms safety and proficiency training. Things were going so well in Strawn's new assignment that the agency recently decided to hire him back permanently, Chronister said. As they lined up after school Wednesday to take their children home, parents at Valrico Elementary — where Strawn worked and his granddaughter attended school — started to hear about what had happened. As she sat in her car waiting for her son, Ingrid Martinez said she'd heard only about ""a tragedy"" but no details. Shown a photo of Strawn, Martinez said her son, a second grader, used to call the same man ""the nice policeman."" ""He would sit down with them sometimes at lunch,"" Martinez said. ""My son would always say, 'He's a very nice guy, Mommy.'"" The school district said crisis team members would be available to students and staff at Valrico Elementary. ""Londyn was a first grade student at the school. She loved to learn and was excited about reading and math. She had a kind spirit and always helped classmates,"" district spokeswoman Tanya Arja said in a statement about the 6-year-old victim. The sheriff said Strawn underwent ""extensive"" background and psychological testing before he was re-hired. ""He had a phenomenal reputation throughout the Sheriff's Office,"" Chronister said. ""No indication whatsoever … that this deputy would conduct himself in the manner he did."" The slayings mark the second time this year that a Hillsborough deputy was blamed for a domestic violence-related murder-suicide. In September, Deputy Kirk Keithley shot his wife, Samantha, in their Land O' Lakes home, then killed himself. ""We've been concerned because we've seen suicide rates have risen,"" Chronister said. ""Why is this occurring? I wish I knew."" Times staff writers Howard Altman, Anastasia Dawson and Marlene Sokol, and senior news researcher John Martin contributed to this report.

322,http://time.com/person-of-the-year-2018-the-guardians/,"Short List Person of the Year The Short List Karl Vick Moises Saman—Magnum Photos The stout man with the gray goatee and the gentle demeanor dared to disagree with his country’s government. He told the world the truth about its brutality toward those who would speak out. And he was murdered for it. Every detail of Jamal Khashoggi’s killing made it a sensation: the time stamp on the surveillance video that captured the Saudi journalist entering his country’s Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2; the taxiway images of the private jets bearing his assassins; the bone saw; the reports of his final words, “I can’t breathe,” recorded on audio as the life was choked from him. But the crime would not have remained atop the world news for two months if not for the epic themes that Khashoggi himself was ever alert to, and spent his life placing before the public. His death laid bare the true nature of a smiling prince, the utter absence of morality in the Saudi-U.S. alliance and—in the cascade of news feeds and alerts, posts and shares and links—the centrality of the question Khashoggi was killed over: Whom do you trust to tell the story? Buy a copy of the Jamal Khashoggi 2018 Person of the Year issue.Buy a copy of the Capital Gazette 2018 Person of the Year issue.Read TIME Editor in Chief Edward Felsenthal on this year's Person of the Year Choice. Khashoggi put his faith in bearing witness. He put it in the field reporting he had done since youth, in the newspaper editorship he was forced out of and in the columns he wrote from lonely exile. “Must we choose,” he asked in the Washington Post in May, “between movie theaters and our rights as citizens to speak out, whether in support of or critical of our government’s actions?” Khashoggi had fled his homeland last year even though he actually supported much of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s agenda in Saudi Arabia. What irked the kingdom and marked the journalist for death was Khashoggi’s insistence on coming to that conclusion on his own, tempering it with troubling facts and trusting the public to think for itself. Such independence is no small thing. It marks the distinction between tyranny and democracy. And in a world where budding authoritarians have advanced by blurring the difference, there was a clarity in the spectacle of a tyrant’s fury visited upon a man armed only with a pen. Because the strongmen of the world only look strong. All despots live in fear of their people. To see genuine strength, look to the spaces where individuals dare to describe what’s going on in front of them. In the Philippines, a 55-year-old woman named Maria Ressa steers Rappler, an online news site she helped found, through a superstorm of the two most formidable forces in the information universe: social media and a populist President with authoritarian inclinations. Rappler has chronicled the violent drug war and extrajudicial killings of President Rodrigo Duterte that have left some 12,000 people dead, according to a January estimate from Human Rights Watch. The Duterte government refuses to accredit a Rappler journalist to cover it, and in November charged the site with tax fraud, allegations that could send Ressa to prison for up to 10 years. In Annapolis, Md., staff of the Capital, a newspaper published by Capital Gazette Communications, which traces its history of telling readers about the events in Maryland to before the American Revolution, press on without the five colleagues gunned down in their newsroom on June 28. Still intact, indeed strengthened after the mass shooting, are the bonds of trust and community that for national news outlets have been eroded on strikingly partisan lines, never more than this year. Watch: Why the Guardians Are the 2018 Person of the Year And in prison in Myanmar, two young Reuters reporters remain separated from their wives and children, serving a sentence for defying the ethnic divisions that rend that country. For documenting the deaths of 10 minority Rohingya Muslims, Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone got seven years. The killers they exposed were sentenced to 10. This year brought no shortage of other examples. Bangladeshi photographer Shahidul Alam was jailed for more than 100 days for making “false” and “provocative” statements after criticizing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in an interview about mass protests in Dhaka. In Sudan, freelance journalist Amal Habani was arrested while covering economic protests, detained for 34 days and beaten with electric rods. In Brazil, reporter Patricia Campos Mello was targeted with threats after reporting that supporters of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro had funded a campaign to spread false news stories on WhatsApp. And Victor Mallet, Asia news editor for the Financial Times, was forced out of Hong Kong after inviting an activist to speak at a press club event against the wishes of the Chinese government. Worldwide, a record number of journalists—262 in total—were imprisoned in 2017, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which expects the total to be high again this year. This ought to be a time when democracy leaps forward, an informed citizenry being essential to self-government. Instead, it’s in retreat. Three decades after the Cold War defeat of a blunt and crude autocracy, a more clever brand takes nourishment from the murk that surrounds us. The old-school despot embraced censorship. The modern despot, finding that more difficult, foments mistrust of credible fact, thrives on the confusion loosed by social media and fashions the illusion of legitimacy from supplicants. Modern misinformation, says David Patrikarakos, author of the book War in 140 Characters, titled after the original maximum length of a Twitter post, “does not function like traditional propaganda. It tries to muddy the waters. It tries to sow as much confusion and as much misinformation as possible, so that when people see the truth, they find it harder to recognize.” The story of this assault on truth is, somewhat paradoxically, one of the hardest to tell. “We all learned in our schools that journalists shouldn’t be the story ourselves, but this is, again, not our choice,” says Can Dündar, who, after being charged with revealing state secrets and nearly assassinated as a newspaper editor in Turkey, fled to Germany, where he set up a news site. “This is the world of the strong leaders who hate the free press and truth.” That world is led, in some ways, by a U.S. President whose embrace of despots and attacks on the press has set a troubling tone. “I think the biggest problem that we face right now is that the beacon of democracy, the one that stood up for both human rights and press freedom—the United States—now is very confused,” says Ressa, the Rappler editor. “What are the values of the United States?” The question no longer seems strange, for the same reason a close look at where we get our news no longer sounds like civics-class homework. In normal times, the U.S. news media is so much a part of public life that, like air, it’s almost impossible to make it out. But it has been made conspicuous—by the attacks and routine falsehoods of the President, by social-media behemoths that distribute news but do not produce it and by the emerging reality of what’s at stake. Efforts to undermine factual truth, and those who honestly seek it out, call into doubt the functioning of democracy. Freedom of speech, after all, was purposefully placed first in the Bill of Rights. In 2018, journalists took note of what people said, and of what people did. When those two things differed, they took note of that too. The year brought no great change in what they do or how they do it. What changed was how much it matters. *** “I can tell you this,” declared Chase Cook, a reporter for the Capital Gazette. “We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow.” Cook’s promise, shared with the world on Twitter, came just a few hours after five of his colleagues were killed. The man charged with their murders had been obsessed with the paper since it wrote about his harassment of a high school classmate—part of its routine coverage of local legal proceedings. He made the office a crime scene. To put the damn paper out, staffers set up laptops in the bed of a pickup in a parking garage across the street. When the next edition arrived—on schedule—the opinion page was blank but for the names of the dead. Gerald Fischman. Rob Hiaasen. John McNamara. Rebecca Smith. Wendi Winters. Beneath their names was a coda that might have been written with a goose quill: “Tomorrow this page will return to its steady purpose of offering our readers informed opinion about the world around them, that they might be better citizens.” That’s the workaday business of local news. “Community journalists are the only ones who are going to go to your kid’s basketball game,” says Selene San Felice, a Capital Gazette features reporter. “They’re the only ones who are going to cover lifeguard training ... They’re the only ones who are going to cover your local elections and tell you exactly what’s going on.” This passing of valued information is a wholesome essential of self-government. We can’t reason together if we don’t know what we’re talking about. But the information has to be trusted. It mostly still is, in places like Annapolis, where the Capital Gazette operates. A poll released in August by the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit devoted to improving journalism, found that more than 70% of Americans express either “a fair amount” or “a great deal” of trust in both their local papers and local TV news, even as resources for both continue to shrink. It’s what you might expect of neighbors. At the local level, journalists and community remain mutually reinforcing. The national media enjoyed the same kind of connection not so long ago. In 1976, 72% of Americans voiced trust in all news outlets (before 1972, whether Americans trusted the news media was not a question Gallup bothered to ask). But while most institutions rode a steady downslope in public confidence in the jaundiced aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, the national media traveled its own path. There was a split—by party. 'I’ve been a war-zone correspondent. That is easy compared to what we’re dealing with now.' Maria Ressa “We have an era from the ’70s until about 2000, when both Democrats and Republicans were becoming more skeptical of the press,” says Jonathan Ladd, director of the American Institutional Confidence Poll at Georgetown University. “Then in the past 18 to 20 years, the partisan divide is growing, where most of the continuing decline is on the Republican side.” The division coincides with the growth of partisan cable news networks. In 1996, Fox News Channel was founded on the assumption that the national media reflected the liberal inclinations of journalists working for it. And surveys did show a lean to the left in their personal politics. Fox was not the first news outlet to thrive by offering news viewers the satisfaction of a shared view of the world—MSNBC, its liberal counterpart, premiered four months earlier—but it was the most strikingly partisan in a television landscape that historically tried not to be. When TV arrived in homes via physically scarce airwaves, a license to broadcast was deemed a public trust, and the Federal Communications Commission enforced the Fairness Doctrine, which required stations to cover public controversies, and to include more than one side. The hundreds of channels brought by cable rendered the scarcity premise obsolete as justification for regulation (the Fairness Doctrine was repealed in 1987), and the fire hose that is the Internet has washed away the last traces. So it was that TV news went from being a blandly unifying force, confined largely to half-hour nightly newscasts, to a constant companion nudging the country into partisan camps. Especially around presidential elections. On a fever chart of media trust, the downward slope makes sharp dips every four years, followed by upswings after the President is chosen. But the recovery after 2016 was partial. Republicans remain deeply distrustful of most news outlets. “Even things that are demonstrably true, people are skeptical about, and that’s a pretty dangerous slope to be on,” says Marc Hetherington, a political-science professor at the University of North Carolina and author of Why Trust Matters. Most journalists are under no illusions about their infallibility. They make mistakes, every day. The framing of “fake news” posits that any errors are intentional, a coordinated campaign to deceive. Less discussed—and contrasting sharply with the lies of autocrats—is the speed with which any good news organization moves to publicly correct and acknowledge its mistakes. “People assume the worst about journalism,” says Joy Mayer, director of the Trusting News Project, which works with community news organizations. “They have all these assumptions that we pay our sources, that when we talk about anonymous sources, we don’t even know who those sources are. They’re surprised that we have ethics policies and that we have long discussions about which word to use or which photo to use.” News organizations bear some responsibility for this. The ethos of remaining separate from the story has hindered journalists from explaining how they do their work, warts and all. But some are finding these days that just communicating basic and obvious facts can be a struggle. That’s even harder from a distance. “Freedom of the press starts at the local level,” says Capital editor Rick Hutzell. “At the national level nobody’s listening—they’re all shouting too much.” *** The morning after dissident politician Boris Nemtsov was murdered on a Moscow bridge in 2015, employees at a troll farm called the Internet Research Agency opened their work orders: “Create the opinion that Ukrainians could have been mixed up in the death of the Russian opposition figure.” We know about the instruction because some of the few media outlets free of Vladimir Putin’s control—including a news outlet called MR7.ru—got a copy, and posted it online. Otherwise, Nemtsov’s death might have been obscured entirely by the haze of charge, countercharge, links and conspiracy theory that autocrats encourage, because they obscure testable reality and the activism it might inspire. In the U.S., hyperconnectivity means the country can be targeted by misinformation from anywhere. The same Internet Research Agency was named in the federal indictment handed up to a U.S. District Court in February, charging Putin’s allies with mass-producing posts that aimed to affect the 2016 presidential election. By then, the U.S. intelligence agencies and Justice Department had concluded that Russian operatives seeded Facebook with uncounted posts intended to help the Trump campaign and sow dissent among supporters of Hillary Clinton. Bloomberg News revealed that, with the help of Facebook employees, the Trump campaign used nonpublic “dark” posts to discourage some African Americans from voting. In March, the New York Times and Britain’s Observer reported that Facebook had allowed private data from up to 87 million users to reach Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy founded by a billionaire backer of Trump. The data was used to promote his candidacy without users knowing the source. “I had the immediate association with the brainwashing of the communist regime,” says Vera Jourova, the European Union Commissioner for Justice, who grew up in communist Czechoslovakia. “When you are targeted with this misinformation through your mailbox or Facebook account, without having a clue that someone is trying to influence you, the result is the same. So that was my first instinct: My God, we have to stop this. This is turning into a totalitarian arrangement.” Information on social media turns out to be hugely problematic. Facebook, like other social media, makes money by keeping people on the platform. To do so, its software—the algorithms that determine what shows up on your screen—frequently delivers content in a way that promotes political polarization. Some of the problem is mixing civics with kid pictures, “social” and society. For the same reason that people avoid political discussion at Thanksgiving, Facebook users may tend not to “friend” people with opposing views. But even if they do, Facebook will suppress their views in your news feed—by 5% among conservatives, and 8% for liberals, according to University of North Carolina information sciences professor Zeynep Tufekci’s analysis of a study by Facebook data scientists. That unseen suppression occurs on top of people’s conscious decisions not to click on things they disagree with. In the same study, those decisions limited exposure to diverse opinions by 6% for liberals and by 17% for conservatives. Facebook has said it is changing its algorithms to promote “meaningful” social interactions and working to limit fake news on the platform. Two-thirds of American adults say they get news from social media. In a 2018 survey by Gallup and the Knight Foundation, Americans said they regard 65% of information on social media as “misinformation.” Machines are not friends of civic engagement. Within the bubbles they help us build, the algorithms tend to promote negative messages. “Fear and anger produce a lot more engagement and sharing than joy,” early Facebook investor turned critic Roger McNamee wrote in the Washington Monthly. BuzzFeed reported shortly after Trump’s election that “top fake election news stories generated more total engagement on Facebook than top election stories from 19 major news outlets combined.” In real life, engagement can mean listening, exchanging opinions, reading faces. In tech, engagement means any activity on the platform, which maximizes profits for companies that sell your attention to advertisers. Print media and TV sell ads too, but their primary product was credibility. As established media companies struggled to adapt their business models to digital, they often lined up to partner with the social-media companies that now controlled the audience. In some countries, social media essentially is the Internet. A Facebook-funded program makes the social-media site free in the Philippines, which means most people are unable to access anything beyond it, as other websites—including news sites—require more expensive data use. “If your mass base gets Facebook for free and thinks it’s the Internet, they don’t realize A) it’s filtered and B) You can’t search,” says Ressa, the Rappler editor. Without search, there’s no way to check information. When the Internet started, the goal was empowerment through connection. Now, when Jourova sees senior executives from Google and Facebook, she says her first question is: “‘How will you improve the world which you have spoiled?’ At first they laugh, and then they see that I mean it seriously. “It’s been a painful period for them,” Jourova says of the Silicon Valley giants. “They underestimated the natural movement and behavior of bad forces.” The other factor is financial, she says. “When you make big money, you can become blind to the moral aspect of what you’re doing.” The E.U. is pushing regulations that would require platforms to remove hate speech and propaganda. Computational propaganda was the term Ressa picked up at a conference: “It is meant to mislead and deceive to create artificial consensus, to manufacture reality.” Google took the motto “Don’t be evil,” but, like Facebook, makes money by selling our attention. Twenty-one percent of American adults get some of their news from YouTube, a Google company. Its algorithm produces engagement by suggesting (and often auto-playing) videos endlessly, but not randomly. Nor does the site exhibit much evidence of journalistic rigor. On Nov. 27 at 11 a.m., two of the five stories displayed on YouTube’s World News home page were from RT, formerly known as Russia Today, the Kremlin-backed 24-hour news channel, notorious for its sly disinformation. 'Some of my Facebook friends attacked me and would ask, 'Why can't you control your husband?' They called him and Kyaw Soe Oo traitors. I have just become numb to it.' Pan Ei Mon In a statement, a spokesperson for YouTube said it has worked to change its algorithms over the last year to promote credible news sources and provide more fact-checking resources. Small wonder that the heaviest users of social media—young people—are the most skeptical of what’s presented to them as news. In groups convened by the Knight Foundation to talk about news and smartphones, teens and college-age Americans said they consider every source biased, except perhaps raw video from cell phones or surveillance cameras. But their appetite for authentic information remains acute. And as they shift from one platform to another, comparing sources and sifting facts, they are basically acting as journalists. Which says something about the state of the news business in 2018. The Internet was supposed to make reporting more transparent. In a world where readers and viewers can get online and check everything, you’d better show your work. But it wasn’t that simple. The Internet also siphoned away ad revenue—roughly 60% of every digital advertising dollar in the U.S. now goes to Google or Facebook. In recent years, news outlets relied heavily on the platforms to steer audience their way, and in order to find favor on Facebook’s algorithms or a Google search, stories were tweaked for grabby headlines or to elevate the emotional angle. The net effect: fewer and fewer people are actually out reporting—the number of journalists has dropped from 114,000 to 88,000 from 2009 to 2017—while more and more stories recast the same facts in a slightly different way, to provoke reposting on social media. In the U.S., local newsrooms are disappearing fastest. Since 2004, the U.S. lost nearly 1,800 newspapers, the UNC Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media found in an October report. Half of the 3,143 counties in the U.S. now have just one newspaper, usually a small weekly. Nearly 200 counties have no newspaper. And “between 1,300 and 1,400 communities that had newspapers of their own in 2004 now have no local news coverage at all.” 'Free journalism in Venezuela is a species in extinction.' Luz Mely Reyes *** For a certain kind of politician, there is an almost liberating genius to framing independent journalists as the enemy. Stray from the truth, and whoever corrects you can be dismissed as “the other side.” The strategy runs on a dangerous assumption—that we’re not all in this together. A month after taking office, President Trump sat for an interview with Breitbart, the right-wing online news site that had been run by his then chief strategist, Steve Bannon. “The fake media is the opposition party,” the President declared. “The fake media is the enemy of the American people.” The “enemy” line had been floated 10 days earlier, in a tweet that named the offending news organizations: “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!” The President may not have known the history of the phrase. It was used in the Soviet Union, to condemn subordinates at the 1930s show trials Joseph Stalin ordered before executing those who had fallen out of favor. “The people” were peasants who had starved after Stalin confiscated grain harvests. The officials were the dictator’s scapegoats. The Breitbart reporter was interested in defining fake news. He asked: “Can you kind of more clearly define what standards and quality we should expect from those who are doing reporting?” “It’s intent,” Trump replied. Intent is difficult to assess from outside, but in writing the Constitution a President swears an oath to defend, the Founders made their intentions clear enough: the press is intended to serve the public, and thus serve as a check on government. “The only security of all is in a free press,” wrote Thomas Jefferson, who famously said that given the choice between government and newspapers, he would make do without government (not that he didn’t have his share of criticism for the ways those papers covered him). Trump’s rhetoric has been embraced by leaders less restrained in their ability to tamp down on reporters. In Hungary, ahead of elections in April, investigative reporter Andras Dezso embarrassed the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a democratically elected ultranationalist who had solidified power by vilifying immigrants. After state television carried a sensational interview with a woman who told frightening stories of Muslim immigrants, Dezso exposed deep flaws in her account, reporting her ties to Orban’s allies and her record of legal troubles for Index.hu, one of the shrinking number of outlets not controlled by government loyalists. Police called the reporter in for questioning, taking his fingerprints and mug shot. A court then issued a formal reprimand against him for “misusing” information he had found in public databases. “The post-truth wave started in Hungary two years before Trump,” says Dezso, who draws a line from the U.S. President’s attacks on the media to the plight of journalists in countries where the U.S. formerly encouraged democracy. “It was very useful for Orban that Trump took up his line against the media. It showed the government here that they can become more aggressive, more bold in their own attacks against us.” The attacks against the press feed into populism’s dark side. “What Orban did first was cast journalists as his political opponents,” says Dezso. “Not merely chroniclers of the political scene but actors within it. The people then saw us as a pillar of power, and there is a primal pleasure in watching such pillars burned.” 'This is the world of the strong leaders who hate the free press and truth. When you start defending the truth, you become the story itself.' Can Dündar At least for some. “With polarization, the belief in your own truth has become stronger, and it doesn’t matter if others say it’s a lie,” says Cristina Zahar, executive secretary of the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism. Brazilians in October elected Bolsonaro, a populist reactionary who lambasts major media outlets. “These are new times, really new times,” she says. “And journalists need to find ways to deal with this.” For now, the most prominent U.S. newspapers resist a combat role. “We’re not at war with the Administration. We’re at work,” Washington Post editor Martin Baron has said. And there’s been a lot of work to do. In the first year of the Trump presidency, 25 top Administration officials and Cabinet members have resigned or been fired—more than triple the percentage of Obama, Clinton and both Bushes, and double that of Reagan—following revelations of conflicts of interest, corruption or other impropriety, many uncovered by reporters. The New York Times dug through 100,000 pages of documents to determine that Trump had received at least $413 million from his father, and participated in “dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud.” The Wall Street Journal revealed candidate Trump had paid $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels, an apparent campaign-finance felony. ProPublica’s release of a recording of children crying in a detention center galvanized public attention on the Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy of separating children from their parents at the border with Mexico. It’s accountability reporting of the first order, backed by long tradition and legal protections. But those protections have started to crack even in the places where they used to be strongest. Four reporters have been murdered in the European Union since the start of last year. In February, police found the body of Ján Kuciak, a methodical chronicler of corruption in Slovakia, alongside that of his fiancée. The couple, both 27 years old, had been shot at point-blank range inside the modest house they planned to make their family home. The attack on the Capital Gazette newsroom made the U.S. the fourth-deadliest country for journalists this year, tied with Mexico, notorious for the dangers its journalists face. “You never know when or where you can get smacked,” says Ismael Bojórquez, whose colleague Javier Valdez at the RioDoce, an independent paper in Sinaloa state, notorious as the cradle of narco-trafficking, was killed outside the newspaper’s front door last year. Dulcina Parra, a Sinaloa reporter who emerged alive from a 2009 kidnapping, still goes to work. “I feel it’s part of what I owe society,” she says. It’s when attacks are both political and personal that neutral ground shrinks, and professional truth seekers feel extraordinary pressure to choose a side. Khashoggi rejected the label “dissident,” insisting, “‘I am an independent journalist using his pen for the good of his country,’” his fiancée Hatice Cengiz wrote in the New York Times. In exile, the Turkish journalist Dündar regrets being forced to act as a dissident in the pursuit of truth. In Kiev, Arkady Babchenko decided it was the only choice. At his old Moscow newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, at least five journalists have been killed since 2000. Babchenko says he knew most of them personally. So when security officers in Ukraine warned him that he was targeted for assassination, he took the threat seriously. Then he says they told him the only way to expose the plot—and remove the threat to others on the hit list—was to fake his own death. Babchenko went along: he was photographed in a pool of pig’s blood, then revealed his living self at a news conference the next day. Suspects were arrested, but the charade left the reporter a pariah to some colleagues, and Babchenko in a new place. Once a week, bodyguards follow him to his talk show, where he discusses Russian affairs before a backdrop of the Kremlin in flames. Accuracy, fairness, professionalism—the pillars of journalism took root in the U.S. and Britain, spread around the world, and remain the standard. In the U.S., the press retains qualities of a citadel, protected not only by laws and court decisions, but the awareness of the great majority of public officials who serve something larger than themselves. But dissonance rains down from the top. In November, the White House not only took the unprecedented step of banning a reporter—it then released, as supporting evidence, an apparently doctored video, digitally altered to portray actions that had not occurred. Still more remarkably, the video was first shared by Infowars, the aptly named website of Alex Jones, the fringe conspiracy theorist who traffics in paranoia and illusion. 'Freedom of expression is like a jungle now. We have no laws. You’re not a citizen. You are nothing.' Amal Habani A U.S. district judge ordered CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s press pass returned; Fox News joined the pleadings on the side of the press, and the White House obliged. But days earlier, a Fox host, Sean Hannity, had joined the President on the stage of a campaign rally. The President promotes Fox shows routinely in tweets, and vociferously opposed the merger of CNN parent company Time Warner (a onetime parent of TIME) with AT&T. The consolidation of the nation’s media outlets is certainly cause for concern. Just five corporations control what most Americans see or hear (in 1983, it was 50). But Trump made no public objection when Sinclair Broadcast Group proposed buying Tribune Media. That merger would have left Sinclair with television stations that reach 72% of U.S. homes—nearly double the percentage allowed by the FCC, which had winked at earlier expansions. Sinclair is an unusual owner, in that it requires stations to carry news reports and commentaries from its central office, packaged to appear local. In March, Sinclair required some 200 anchors to recite a script warning that “some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control exactly what people think.” The website Deadspin captured the Orwellian moment in a chilling compilation video. For the first time in living memory, an element of personal danger has entered coverage of public affairs in America. Bodyguards now escort CNN reporters through Trump rallies, and the network’s Manhattan newsroom was evacuated in October when its mail room found one of the 16 pipe bombs addressed to Trump critics. Police traced the bombs to a Florida man living in a van plastered with Trump stickers. *** The heightened risk for journalists in the U.S. still pales compared with those working to report the truth elsewhere. In Myanmar, the friction points in society are ethnic, with an overlay of religion. About 88% of the people are Buddhist. The Rohingya are a small population of Muslims mostly from the state of Rakhine, not far from Bangladesh, the Muslim country that many Burmese regard as the best dwelling place for the Rohingya. Successive governments have refused to give Rohingya citizenship, rendering most stateless. There is an armed separatist movement, a contested history and a state of tension that is almost constant, especially in Rakhine state. Kyaw Soe Oo grew up there. He was raised Buddhist, but did not share the widespread bias against his Rohingya neighbors. “Kyaw Soe Oo believes every human should be treated equally and there should be no discrimination against anyone,” says his wife, Chit Su Win. “He has tried to teach his daughter this value too.” As her mother spoke inside a tidy apartment strewn with toys in Yangon’s Insein township, the 3-year-old sat on her lap, watching Frozen. Once a poet, Kyaw Soe Oo found a passion for journalism. He worked for a local paper, then in 2017 was hired as a reporter for Reuters, the global news agency. He worked closely with Wa Lone, a hard-charging reporter who at 32 is four years older, also Buddhist and also from the provinces. Together, they covered one of the biggest stories in the world that year—the transfer of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya across the border to Bangladesh, pushed out by Burmese forces. Working in their homeland for a leading international news organization, they walked a line that eluded Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of the government who, before she wielded political power, won a Nobel Prize for Peace for her moral authority. In power, she has remained silent as verified reports pile up of arson, rape and mass executions by military forces against the Rohingya. 'When you’re confronted with evil, real evil, you can’t just take your notebook out and ask it for a comment.' Arkady Babchenko On Dec. 12, 2017, Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone were invited to dinner by a police official. They had been investigating the execution of 10 Rohingya men the official’s unit was involved in. After the meal, the police handed the reporters some papers, discreetly wrapped in a newspaper. Moments later, the reporters were placed under arrest for possession of the papers, which they had not yet read. In September, Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone were sentenced to seven years in prison. A police captain who testified that they were framed was prosecuted separately. Whom do you trust? It may seem a wonder that, in a world riven by tribal tensions, national leaders seek division where sturdy bridges already stand, and confusion where clarity can mean the difference between life and death. The world may not be getting worse, only more confused, but in time that distinction can vanish. There is urgent work ahead in shaping a communications system guided not by software but by the judgment of citizens, and the social contract implied in the First Amendment: facts matter. Not even his wife really understood what Kyaw Soe Oo did for a living. She got a glimmer of the risk involved from a Korean movie they watched together, about a reporter covering a massacre. And then one day in 2017 she went with him into Rakhine, to do some sightseeing in a town that suddenly came under attack from a Rohingya militant group. “I went with him because I had never been to Maungdaw before,” she says. “I wanted to see Maungdaw. I saw fighting. “I ran. He went to work.” —With reporting by Abigail Abrams, Katie Reilly and Paul Moakley/New York; Abby Vesoulis and Josh Meyer/Washington; Simon Shuster/Kiev; Eli Meixler/Dhaka; Laignee Barron/Yangon; Ioan Grillo/Sinaloa; Joseph Hincks and Feliz Solomon/Hong Kong; and Matt Sandy/Rio de Janeiro Read TIME Editor in Chief Edward Felsenthal on this year's Person of the Year Choice.",2018-12-15 00:00:00,TIME Person of the Year 2018: The Guardians | Time.com,,4419,http://time.com

Nikki Haley is not coming straight back to the Palmetto State after she leaves the United Nations at year's end. She plans on staying in New York where her son attends high school. ""South Carolina will always be home for Ambassador Haley and her family, and they look forward to returning to their friends and family in the Palmetto State after her son finishes high school,"" Haley spokeswoman Chaney Adams said in a statement. The return will be long enough away that Haley and her husband, Michael, recently sold their Lexington home. Haley, 46, has not revealed what she will do when she leaves the United Nations after two years. The Post and Courier has learned a second book is in the works, per several sources who asked to not to be identified because they were not authorized to reveal the news. Haley released a memoir ""Can't Is Not An Option"" in 2012, a year after she took office as South Carolina's first female and first minority governor. At the time, she was hailed as a rising star who could help attract more diverse voters to the Republican Party. The book focused on her upbringing in rural Bamberg where she and her parents, immigrants from India, faced discrimination, and her rise in politics punctuated by her surprise gubernatorial win in 2010 that was spurred by a campaign rally with former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. A new book would surely focus on her successful call for the removal of the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds in 2015 after the shock of the Emanuel AME Church mass shooting by an avowed white supremacist. Her stance, unpopular among those who defended the Civil War banner, thrust her into the national spotlight. She would likely share her experiences as U.N. ambassador and as a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet where she is leaving on good terms, a rare feat in the topsy-turvy administration. She has been one of Trump's more popular Cabinet picks, an outcome that could help her future political prospects. Email Sign Up! ""A book deal is where politicians hang their futures,"" New York literary agent Lucianne Goldberg said. After not responding to a question earlier in the day about the ambassador writing a book, Adams sent a statement late Tuesday evening that Haley ""has not begun work on a book or had conversations with any publishers about writing one.” Seated next to the president on the day she announced she planned to leave the United Nations, Haley pledged to back Trump's re-election in 2020. She is widely expected to mount her own White House bid in 2024, though some news outlets have reported she could be Trump's new running mate in 2020. In the meantime, Haley needs to find a new job. Federal ethics reports show Haley and her husband had debt from $525,000 to about $1.1 million from credit cards, mortgage and a line of credit in 2017, the latest year available. The couple's current debt is ""well below $500,000,"" Adams said in October. Haley is leaving the United Nations at the same time her second and final term as governor would have ended if she had not joined the Trump administration in early 2017. As first reported by FITS News, the ambassador and her husband sold their five-bedroom, four-bathroom home last month for $405,000 to Brian and Lauren Prahl. The 3,541-square-foot home owned by the Haleys for 19 years has a tax value of $352,000, according to online property records. Brian Prahl, who runs a Lexington mortgage firm, said he did not realize the home belonged to Haley until he did some pricing research after his first visit with a real estate agent. Michael Haley has been back in South Carolina where he works for the S.C. National Guard, his employer during much of the time while Haley was governor from 2011 to 2017. The couple's other child attends Clemson University, where Nikki Haley graduated with a degree in accounting.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration moved Tuesday to officially ban bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms, and has made them illegal to possess beginning in late March. The devices will be banned under a federal law that prohibits machine guns, according to a senior Justice Department official. Bump stocks became a focal point of the national gun control debate after they were used in October 2017 when a man opened fired from his Las Vegas hotel suite into a crowd at a country music concert below, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The regulation, which was signed by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker on Tuesday morning, will go into effect 90 days after it is formally published in the Federal Register, which is expected to happen on Friday, the Justice Department official said. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly ahead of the regulation's formal publication and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Read more: Scientists pinpointed factors that put a community at risk of a mass shooting — and found 2 gun laws that could make a difference In March, President Donald Trump said his administration would ""ban"" the devices, which he said ""turn legal weapons into illegal machines."" Shortly after the president's comments, the Justice Department announced that it had started the process to amend federal firearms regulations to define bump stocks as machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives sought public comment on the proposal, drawing more than 35,000 comments. The amended regulations reverse a 2010 ATF decision that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress changed existing firearms law or passed a new one. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, there was a growing push by some members of Congress to ban bump stocks, but no legislation was passed. At least 10 states have sought their own restrictions on the devices. People who own bump stocks will be required to either surrender them to the ATF or destroy them by late March, the official said. The change has undergone a legal review and the Justice Department and ATF are ready to fight any legal challenge that may be brought, the official added. The amended rule was met almost immediately with resistance from gun rights advocates, including Gun Owners of America, which said it would file a lawsuit against the Justice Department and ATF in order to protect gun owners from the ""unconstitutional regulations.""

The odds may surprise you ""These regulations implicate Second Amendment rights, and courts should be highly suspect when an agency changes its 'interpretation' of a statute in order to impair the exercise of enumerated constitutional rights,"" the organization's executive director, Erich Pratt, said. Police said the gunman in the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock, fired for more than 10 minutes using multiple weapons outfitted with target scopes and bump stocks. Paddock fatally shot himself after the shooting and there were 23 assault-style weapons, including 14 fitted with rapid-fire ""bump stock"" devices, strewn about the room near his body on the floor of his 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel. The largest manufacturer of bump stocks, Slide Fire Solutions, announced in April that it was going to stop taking orders and shutting down its website.

327,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-nra-just-reported-losing-dollar55-million-in-income,"SEARCH The gun-rights group has its biggest champion in the White House. But its financial situation has worsened in the age of Trump Reporter The nation’s leading gun-rights organization saw its income drop by $55 million last year, after a record-breaking 2016 in which the group and its political affiliates spent unprecedented sums to elect President Donald Trump. The National Rifle Association of America reported $98 million in contributions in 2017, down from nearly $125 million in 2016, according to new tax records obtained by The Daily Beast. Nearly one-fifth of its contributions last year came from a single anonymous donor, who chipped in nearly $19 million to the group. More noteworthy than its drop in contributions, though, was its decline in membership dues. The NRA took in more than $128 million in dues last year—a significant sum, but down considerably from the $163 million it took in the year prior. That decline, more than the drop in direct contributions, appears to indicate a dwindling, if still formidable, base of public support. Asked for comment on the decline, an NRA spokesperson pointed to reporting showing that the organization’s magazine subscriptions have shot up this year, interpreted as an indicator of an accompanying membership surge. Nonetheless, 2017 did not see a financial windfall for the group. In all, the NRA reported just under $312 million in total income, down from nearly $367 million the year before. That loss in funding comes at a tricky political moment for the organization. Rarely has the NRA had so staunch an ally in the White House. But the group, which built significant political heft on the back of Obama-era threats to key gun-rights priorities, has also become a lightning rod in the still-raging debate over gun control and mass shootings in the U.S. And several recently elected House Democrats ran explicitly on pledges to go after the gun lobby when in office. Under President Trump, the NRA has also adopted a more aggressive advocacy posture exceeding its traditional focus on gun-rights issues exclusively. It recently launched a stand-alone political commentary platform, NRA TV, that has veered into culture-war issues at best tangentially related to the Second Amendment. But the NRA’s finances haven’t expanded with that larger mission. The group’s 2017 budget was still significant, at nearly $330 million, but that was down from $412 million in 2016. It reported spending nearly $18 million more than it took in in 2017, which was still a better financial picture than the year before, when it ended the year nearly $46 million in the red. On the whole, the 2017 finances indicate a reversion to the mean for the storied gun-rights group. After pulling out all the stops on Trump’s behalf, the NRA appeared to revert to financial activity more typical of a non-election year, with finances more closely resembling those of 2015 and prior political off-years. That’s not to say it didn’t spend significantly in 2017. About $27 million of the NRA’s expenditures went to its political advocacy arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. But that was down considerably from 2016, when the NRA-ILA spent more than $76 million. The NRA did pass along large sums to another key political organization, donating $775,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association, a coalition of states’ top law-enforcement officers, up from $110,000 in 2016. The bulk of the NRA’s contributions to RAGA last year came just weeks after the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history at a Las Vegas country-music concert. A month later, 24 of the 27 attorneys general who belonged to RAGA teamed up to push concealed-carry legislation, a top NRA priority. Both parties insisted the financial contributions were unrelated to the push.",2018-11-27 16:31:21,The NRA Just Reported Losing $55 Million in Income,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
328,https://mashable.com/article/gofundme-top-fundraisers-campaigns/,"Editor’s note: On Dec. 16, a GoFundMe campaign was launched to fund President Trump’s demand for a border wall. When this note was published on Dec. 21, that campaign had raised $12.6 million. Until the funds are successfully disbursed to the U.S. government for that purpose, this list will not be revised to include the wall campaign. GoFundMe, the world’s largest social fundraising platform, released its annual ""Year in Giving"" report for 2018, which includes data about the most generous U.S. states and cities, global trends, and best of all, the top fundraisers by the numbers. The Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, founded to provide legal support to people who have experienced sexual assault and harassment in the workplace, raised $22 million to become the largest GoFundMe campaign of all time. The top 10 fundraisers of 2018 collectively raised $58 million. Nearly two-thirds of people who donated to GoFundMe campaigns were first-time donors. Not only were people eager to give, they were also quick. A fundraiser for the Humboldt Broncos, a hockey team in Canada involved in a fatal bus crash that killed 16 people and injured 13 others, received 1.9 million views in the first 24 hours. We've included below all 10 of the top campaigns from 2018. Although the year is almost over, you can still donate to Time's Up and many other causes (denoted by an asterisk) on this list. As always, consider these tips to donate wisely and safely. Help survivors of sexual assault and harassment connect to legal resources. People rallied behind the families of the Canadian hockey team who suffered from a devastating bus crash. These funds provided relief and financial support to the victims and families of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. These donations went to the March For Our Lives Action Fund, which helped fund the March For Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C., and the Broward Education Foundation. Humans of New York photographer Brandon Stanton teamed up with French social media star Jérôme Jarre and his humanitarian organization, Love Army, to build homes for Rohingya refugees. After a mass shooting in October, people donated to support survivors, victims' families, and the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Ari Fuld, an American Israeli, was stabbed to death in September by a Palestinian teenager in the West Bank. This campaign raised money to support his wife and four children. Carter, a 6-year-old, was diagnosed with Sanfilippo Syndrome, a fatal brain disorder that currently has no cure. Donations will go to the Cure Sanfilippo Foundation, which funds Carter's clinical trial. Anthony Borges was shot multiple times during the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. This campaign supports his recovery. This fundraiser was created to support Tia Coleman, who lost nine family members during a major boating accident this summer.

DEC. 23, 2018 Massacres are frequently carried out by killers using military-grade equipment that’s easier to obtain when buying on credit. Massacres are frequently carried out by killers using military-grade equipment that’s easier to obtain when buying on credit. By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN DEC. 26, 2018 Two days before Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, he went on Google and typed “Credit card unusual spending.” Mr. Mateen had opened six new credit card accounts — including a Mastercard, an American Express card and three Visa cards — over the previous eight months. Twelve days before the shooting, he began a $26,532 buying spree: a Sig Sauer MCX .223-caliber rifle, a Glock 17 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, several large magazines, thousands of rounds of ammunition and a $7,500 ring for his wife that he bought on a jewelry store card. His average spending before that, on his only card, was $1,500 a month. His web browsing history chronicled his anxiety: “Credit card reports all three bureaus,” “FBI,” and “Why banks stop your purchases.” He needn’t have worried. None of the banks, credit-card network operators or payment processors alerted law enforcement officials about the purchases he thought were so suspicious. Mass shootings routinely set off a national debate on guns, usually focused on regulating firearms and on troubled youths. Little attention is paid to the financial industry that has become an instrumental, if unwitting, enabler of carnage. A New York Times examination of mass shootings since the Virginia Tech attack in 2007 reveals how credit cards have become a crucial part of the planning of these massacres. There have been 13 shootings that killed 10 or more people in the last decade, and in at least eight of them, the killers financed their attacks using credit cards. Some used credit to acquire firearms they could not otherwise have afforded. Those eight shootings killed 217 people. The investigations undertaken in their aftermath uncovered a rich trove of information about the killers’ spending. There were plenty of red flags, if only someone were able to look for them, law enforcement experts say. “Banks will complain this is the government’s job and it’s not our job, but you know what? They are the only ones with the ability to do this,” said Kevin Sullivan, a former New York Police fraud investigator who consults with banks as president of the Anti-Money Laundering Training Academy. After the shooting last February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and staff members were killed, this column suggested that financial firms had an opportunity to help reduce violence by pushing for more responsible practices by the gun industry. As a result, some banks ended their relationships with gunmakers and some investors pushed manufacturers for more transparency. Financial firms have so far resisted changing the way they deal with the sale of guns. Banks and credit-card networks say it is not their responsibility to create systems to track gun purchases that would allow them to report suspicious patterns. “We do not believe Visa should be in the position of setting restrictions on the sale of lawful goods or services,” said Amanda Pires, a Visa spokeswoman. “Our role in commerce is to efficiently process, protect and settle all legal payments. Asking Visa or other payment networks to arbitrate what legal goods can be purchased sets a dangerous precedent.” A spokesman for Mastercard echoed that sentiment, emphasizing its protection of “cardholders’ independence” and the “privacy of their own purchasing decisions.” But the financial industry is uniquely positioned to see, if it chose to do so, a potential killer’s behavior in a way that retailers, law enforcement officials, concerned family members or mental health professionals cannot.

Holmes killed 12 people and injured 70 others at a Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in 2012, a psychiatrist was considering having him involuntarily committed. Mr. Holmes quit his job, filed for unemployment benefits and used a new Mastercard issued by USAA to help buy more than $11,000 in weapons and military gear. He bought two tear-gas grenades, a gas mask and filter, a .40-caliber Glock handgun, a 12-gauge shotgun, a .223-caliber AR-15, a 100-round drum magazine, two 40-round magazines, a laser sight, a bulletproof vest, 5,000 rounds of ammunition, two sets of handcuffs and “road stars” meant to slice through car tires. “This was a civilian making these orders, not the police and not the military,” said Sandy Phillips, whose daughter, Jessica, died in the attack. “Someone should have noticed.” Read the Previous Columns: How Banks Could Control Gun Sales if Washington Won’t Big Investors Have Clout. They Can Use It With Gun Makers. Citigroup Acted. Now, Two New Ideas on How Banks Can Limit Gun Sales. When it comes to certain crimes, banks are on the front lines. They crunch transaction data to protect their customers from fraudulent purchases — often identifying stolen credit cards within seconds — and to detect money laundering, funding of terrorist organizations and other crimes. Banks are required to report transactions of $10,000 or more by a single person, even if those transactions are legal. And after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the government enacted even stricter rules under the Patriot Act: Banks must file so-called Suspicious Activity Reports for transactions involving more than $5,000 that the financial institution “has reason to suspect” are part of a plan to “violate or evade any federal law.” A labyrinth of rules prevents banks and credit-card networks — many of which also handle debit card transactions — from seeing exactly what customers are buying. Retailers have historically resisted providing item-by-item information — known as SKU-level data, a reference to the stock-keeping unit number of an item — for fear that banks would sell that information or use it to steer customers to rival merchants. In the case of gun purchases, even the nature of the retailer can be obscure: The Merchant Category Code, which identifies the type of store that sold an item, is the same for gun shops and sporting goods stores. But retailers have the ability to send far more detailed transaction information. A feature known as a “boxcar” allows retailers to tag transactions with extra data. It is often used by online retailers to send the bank details about consumer behavior, such as the device used to make a purchase and the location of the buyer. If banks required retailers to transmit details on sales of guns and ammunition, they would be able to make more informed decisions about transactions. Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods this year announced that they would not sell firearms to anyone under 21. If banks chose to use the systems they already have in place, they might decide to monitor such customers, perhaps preventing them from buying multiple guns in a short period of time. “They can fine-tune their own systems, because in these cases the suspicious purchasing patterns could have been picked up on and quite frankly should have been picked up on,” said Mr. Sullivan, the Anti-Money Laundering Training Academy president. Banks could also add information about gun sales to the infrastructure they already use to help the government investigate other criminal activity. “We need to step back and think about what tools we use to combat terrorism and money-laundering and think about the financial rules associated with the Patriot Act,” said John Streur, chief executive of Calvert Investments, a mutual fund firm that is an advocate for responsible investing. “In a very real sense, I think these mass shootings are terrorism.” The shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas last year was described as the worst mass murder on American soil since the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The gunman, Stephen Paddock, killed 58 people and injured more than 800. When his body was found on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, the police noticed four credit cards scattered across the kitchenette countertop next to his hotel key card. His rooms were filled with two dozen firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition. He spent nearly $95,000 on firearms and gun-related purchases in the year before the massacre, buying some 55 guns, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s report. Police have not disclosed details of how Mr. Paddock paid for his guns. Some transactions were in cash, but law enforcement officials said he also bought firearms online. Unlike most other mass killers, Mr. Paddock was wealthy. He spent over $600,000 at casinos in the two years leading up to the massacre, and paid over $170,000 to credit card companies. Law enforcement officials saw the full picture of his gun purchases only after they talked to the banks, but they wish they could have connected the dots in advance. “They have all the infrastructure in place,” said Joseph Moreno, a former federal counterterrorism prosecutor and a staff member of the F.B.I.’s 9/11 Review Commission who is now a partner at Cadwalader. “A.T.F. is already involved in S.A.R.s task forces,” he said, referring to suspicious-activity reports. “It would just be tweaking it to consider firearm-related information.” Over the last several months, I have spoken to senior executives at the country’s largest banks and credit card companies who were taken aback when I presented them with the list of shootings that involved their cards: Virginia Tech in 2007, Binghamton in 2009, Fort Hood in 2009, Aurora in 2012, San Bernardino in 2015, Orlando in 2016, Sutherland Springs in 2017 and Las Vegas in 2017. That list is based on interviews and hundreds of documents including police reports and credit card receipts. It may actually underreport the use of credit cards in shootings: In some cases the payment method could not be learned. While some executives expressed grief and were open to discussing possible solutions, virtually none were willing to speak about them on the record for fear of upsetting gun-rights advocates and politicians invoking the Second Amendment. Some raised the prospect that by trying to help they would be held responsible if the system failed. Others made a slippery-slope argument: If they were to police gun sales, should they do the same for alcohol in an effort to prevent drunk-driving deaths? After the school shooting in Parkland, Citibank and Bank of America said they would no longer finance or advise gun manufacturers, while investment firms like BlackRock and pension funds like Calpers, the retirement fund for public employees in California, said they would demand more information from the gunmakers they invested in. Several payment systems — including PayPal, Square and Apple Pay — already had established rules that ban the sale of guns and gun-related items using their systems. But no bank has instituted a ban or committed to tracking gun purchases. John Shrewsberry, chief financial officer of Wells Fargo — which counts the National Rifle Association as a client — has dismissed the notion that banks should regulate the use of its credit cards for gun purchases. “The best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process,” he said in April on a conference call with investors. There may be good reason that no bank executive wants to talk out loud about guns: In October, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, introduced a bill, the No Red and Blue Banks Act, which would “prohibit the federal government from giving contracts to banks that discriminate against lawful businesses based solely on social policy considerations.” The bill was directed at banks that changed their policies regarding guns. “Our friends at Citigroup and Bank of America apparently aren’t busy enough with their banking business; they have decided that they are going to set policy for the Second Amendment,” Mr. Kennedy wrote on Twitter. And a policy expert at the American Civil Liberties Union recently expressed concern about how efforts to prevent mass shootings could infringe on individual rights. “The implication of expecting the government to detect and prevent every mass shooting is believing the government should play an enormously intrusive role in American life,” Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst at the A.C.L.U. Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, wrote in July. Not all the concerns involve privacy or politics. Some are practical. George Brauchler, the district attorney who oversaw the investigation of Mr. Holmes after the Aurora shooting, said the deluge of data the police receive already presents challenge. “To some extent we are looking for a needle in a haystack and that haystack keeps getting bigger and bigger,” he said. The data could inform old-fashioned police work that might or might not lead to something more, he said. “Do I wish someone from law enforcement had been able to go to his door and knock on his door and figure out a way to talk their way into it or to freak him out?"" he said of Mr. Holmes. “Yeah, absolutely.” Jared L. Loughner had the Chase Visa he used to buy a 9-millimeter Glock handgun in the pocket of his jeans when he shot Representative Gabrielle Giffords in the head outside a Tucson supermarket on Jan. 8, 2011. She survived, but six people died. “There are a lot of steps that credit card companies can take that could prevent some of the tragic gun violence in the country,” said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “For companies to say they can’t solve the entire problem and therefore shouldn’t take any steps is just blindly ignoring what they can contribute to the solution.” Elected officials could force the financial system to act. In 29 states, consumers cannot use credit cards to buy lottery tickets because legislators don’t want consumers racking up debt gambling. And under the Gun Control Act of 1968, firearms dealers must report if someone buys two or more handguns in a span of five business days. That requirement can be evaded simply by buying at more than one store, but a system involving the banks and credit card networks could have the opportunity to flag the purchases. After the Pulse shooting, JPMorgan Chase committed more than $300,000 to support the victims and their families. One of the 49 people killed was a Chase employee: Christopher Sanfeliz, 24, a personal banker at a branch in Tampa who had worked his way up from teller after taking business classes at Hillsborough Community College. Mr. Sanfeliz’s father, Carlos, was surprised to learn that the same industry that once employed his son had unwittingly bankrolled other shootings. “Something needs to be done to prevent more attacks,” he said. “I live with this torment every day of my life.” Olivia Carville contributed reporting.

DEC. 14, 2018  After the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February, Congress did not act. But state legislatures did, passing 69 gun control measures this year — more than any other year since the Newtown, Conn., massacre in 2012, and more than three times the number passed in 2017.

The report also found a decrease in measures enacted to expand access to firearms — a major change from the year after the Newtown shooting, when a surge in gun control laws was matched by a surge in gun rights expansions. This year, legislators rejected about 90 percent of state-level bills backed by the National Rifle Association, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control group created by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York City mayor. Data provided by the N.R.A. shows a similar overall trend this year, with gun control measures passed overtaking pro-gun measures for the first time in at least six years, though to a lesser extent than the Giffords data shows. The N.R.A. also said that nearly 200 gun control measures were rejected this year, but did not provide a list of specific legislation backing up their claims. “Michael Bloomberg-funded gun control groups have invested unprecedented resources in their state lobbying and public relations efforts shifting the gun control battleground to the state level,” the N.R.A. said in a statement. (Mr. Bloomberg provides about a third of the budget of Everytown for Gun Safety, and does not fund the Giffords group.) The N.R.A. added that it “continues to win legislative battles in state legislatures across America like the important self-defense legislation that was passed out of the Ohio legislature last week.” Seventeen students and staff members were killed in the Parkland attack, but it was certainly not the nation’s first mass shooting. It is, however, the first one that appears to have been a legislative turning point — a “tectonic shift,” in the words of Allison Anderman, who compiled the report as managing attorney at the Giffords Law Center. “A lot of policies that we had been working on as a movement for years were pushed across the finish line because of Parkland,” Ms. Anderman said. In large part, the shift this year is a product of a less visible turning point after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, in which 20 children and six adults were killed. In response to that massacre, activists founded the organizations that would become Giffords and Everytown for Gun Safety, which gradually built the infrastructure that the current movement has taken advantage of.

That divide is still apparent, but the exceptions are increasing. Democratic state legislatures passed more than twice as many gun restrictions as Republican legislatures this year, and Republican legislatures were the only ones to pass laws loosening restrictions. Still, Republican chambers passed 18 gun control laws, and Nebraska — whose Legislature is conservative even though it is formally nonpartisan — passed another two. Republican governors also signed restrictions passed by Democratic legislatures in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont.

Hawaii More than half of the gun restrictions passed this year came in a post-Parkland flood in March and April, including omnibus bills in Florida and Vermont. In many places, legislators said outright that the Parkland attack had motivated them to act. Nowhere was this clearer than in Florida, where the shooting took place. Legislators there named their omnibus bill the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, after the school where the shooting took place. By the time the Parkland shooting happened, Moms Demand Action, the grass-roots arm of Everytown, had a chapter in every state and local groups in hundreds of communities. Nationally, the group’s volunteer numbers tripled in the months after the shooting, and those volunteers organized en masse in favor of gun restrictions and against permitless carry bills in Alabama, Oklahoma, Virginia and other states. All of the permitless carry bills were defeated. “There was this structure we had built that could take in all of that anger and heartbreak and make it into action and put it into passing laws,” Taylor Maxwell, a spokeswoman for Everytown, said in September. Another factor was strategic. Many people who wanted stricter gun laws despaired when Congress didn’t pass any after Sandy Hook. But it was precisely that inaction in Congress that prompted advocates to start focusing on state legislatures instead. And in some states, a third front has opened up: ballot measures. In last month’s election, voters in Washington State approved an initiative that, among other things, expanded background checks, raised the minimum age to buy semiautomatic rifles, established a waiting period and mandated safe storage of guns.

Polls show that public support for universal background checks is almost unanimous. Extreme risk protection laws, commonly known as red flag laws, are also very popular; they allow judges to order the confiscation of guns from people who family members or law enforcement believe pose an imminent threat. Such a law might have been able to prevent the Parkland massacre, whose perpetrator had been reported to the F.B.I. multiple times. Bans on bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic rifles to fire almost as rapidly as machine guns, have enough bipartisan backing that the Trump administration plans to enact one at the national level. Other measures — like banning certain types of guns, restricting concealed carry and capping magazine sizes — are more divisive, though many of them still have majority support in polls. Most states have their legislative sessions in the first half of the year, and activists on both sides are gearing up for the next round. Robin Lloyd, government affairs director at Giffords, said two areas of focus next year would be extreme risk protection laws and laws banning 3D-printed and other untraceable firearms. Groups like the N.R.A. have been focusing on loosening restrictions on where guns can be carried — for instance, by allowing them in schools — and on letting people carry concealed weapons without a permit. Sources: Giffords Law Center; Everytown for Gun Safety | Notes: Data reflects only measures that significantly affected public access to guns, not ones that made minor changes or affected small subsets of the population. Additionally, each measure is counted separately even if it was part of an omnibus bill, so in 2018, 69 significant measures were contained in 67 bills. For example, a bill in Vermont expanded background checks, increased the minimum age for gun purchases, and restricted bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. Danny Hakim contributed reporting.

You should all know 1836, the double-whammy year of the Battle of San Jacinto and Houston's subsequent founding. History buffs will know 1900 as the year the Great Storm ravaged Galveston, making way for our own upstart city to dominate the region —right as 1901, with Spindletop, propelled Texas into the oil business. In 1961, at Rice Stadium, JFK declared that the U.S. would go to the moon. In 1969, Neil Armstrong announced to Houston's Ground Control that the Eagle had landed. Hurricane Harvey made 2017 one of those watershed years (pun unavoidable). That storm shook the city to its core. It made us rethink who we are. But 2018 wasn't one of those years. 2018 was, blessedly, a year when life mostly got back to normal — beautiful, infuriating, funny, heartbreaking normal. Of course Chronicle photographers' best photos of 2018 capture very specific moments in time. But this year, many of those moments feel intimate, timeless — records of the joys and sorrows that may not make history, but that make up our lives. Here's how the year went: January was bitterly cold, which made life even harder on the streets in Houston. Cats took over the George R. Brown Convention Center.

April was the month that the Houston area remembered its history. First, fast-growing Sugar Land came face-to-face with an ugly piece of its past, in the form of a graveyard for prisoners, mostly African-American, who'd been leased out — a form of labor not far from the slavery that it replaced.  Later that month, Barbara Bush's death, at age 92, led Houston to unpack the life of the the wife and mother of presidents.

Wednesday morning when she arrived at Columbia University for work, Jewish professor Elizabeth Midlarsky was met with two swastikas and the slur “yid” spray-painted in red on her office walls. The following day, and on the other side of the country in southwest Los Angeles, someone spray-painted white swastikas across a section of the celebrated black history murals on Crenshaw Avenue, defacing the figures of the female leaders of the Black Panther movement. Both incidents are being investigated as hate crimes. Both incidents also fit into a string of upsetting anti-Semitic events that have occurred throughout the country this year. “I was in shock,” Midlarsky, who focuses much of her teaching, research, and writing on the Holocaust, told campus newspaper the Columbia Spectator of the incident. “I stopped for a moment, because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.” In Los Angeles, artist Enkone Goodlow, who painted the Black Panther section of the mural, immediately returned to paint over the swastikas after learning about the graffiti. “I was hurt because that portion of the mural has never been defaced,” Goodlow told CNN. While these two events are the most high-profile anti-Semitic crimes of the week, they are not isolated. Goucher College students woke up on Thursday morning to find swastikas spray painted on their Maryland campus. It was the second time this occurred this month; a suspect was arrested. In New Jersey, two middle schools and a high school, all in Union County, found swastikas and other hateful graffiti drawn on their school property as well. Nor is it an issue isolated to this week: As Vox’s Tara Burton reported, there’s been a steady increase in anti-Semitic incidents and hate crimes since the 2016 presidential campaign season. In 2017, the last year for which complete data is available, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an advocacy group dedicated to combating anti-Semitism, found that there had been 1,986 reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States that year, including acts of vandalism as well as physical violence. That figure was a 57 percent increase from 2016, which itself had seen a 35 percent uptick in incidents from 2015. Generally, anti-Semitism has been on the rise over the past few years — there was a nearly 60 percent uptick in incidents in the first year of Trump’s presidency, according to a report by the Anti-Defamation League. And with the October mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11, 2018 has been particularly devastating. Trump’s presidency and the nationalist rhetoric he espouses have been blamed by many for the rising climate of extremism and hate in America. In anticipation of his trip to Pittsburgh after the synagogue shooting, a group of Jewish leaders in the community wrote a letter asking him not to come. They said the attack was, as Vox’s Emily Stewart put it, “the ‘direction culmination’ of the president’s influence.” Both the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter and the man who mailed prominent Democrats bombs earlier this fall both expressed xenophobic sentiments and attacked high-profile political figures as “globalists,” Stewart noted: It’s not hard to see the similarities between these men’s beliefs and Trump’s rhetoric. The president often complains about globalists and at a recent rally declared himself a nationalist. The term “globalist” is often considered code for anti-Semitism. Anti-semitism has long been a rising problem in Europe, but as recently as 2014, scholars thought it was not as serious an issue within the United States. All it takes is one look at Midlarksy’s office walls to see how rapidly that’s changed. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism? Millions turn to Vox to understand what’s happening in the news.

338,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Ted-Cruz-s-margin-of-victory-over-Beto-13448497.php,"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is hugged by his wife, Heidi, during an election night victory party, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Houston. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip) While Beto O'Rourke, left, mulls a run for the Texas governorship, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is trying to act as if nothing has changed after he helped stoke the false allegations of election fraud that led in part to the assault on the U.S. Capitol. As newly updated election results showed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz’s victory was even tighter than first realized, Democratic-led voter registration groups are saying they’ve never felt closer to turning Texas into a true battleground. Cruz’s margin of victory fell to just 214,921 votes, according to official results certified by Gov. Greg Abbott this week. That is about 5,000 votes closer than unofficial results showed last month. Cruz won the race 50.9 to 48.3 percent — the closet U.S. Senate race in Texas since 1978. While O’Rourke lost, groups like Battleground Texas say that margin of defeat is nearly four times closer than they thought was even possible and it has them itching to get to work on 2020. “We can register that gap,” said Oscar Silva, executive director of Battleground Texas, a group that runs an aggressive registration program targeting potential Democratic voters. The state saw twice that number of voters just registered between March and October, and Silva noted that every year 300,000 more Texas high school students come of age to register. He said while many people suggest that 2018 was a one-year blip because of O’Rourke’s campaign, groups like Battleground Texas have been on the ground building an infrastructure that has lasting implications. “That is sustainable,” he told the American Association of Political Consultants at a conference in Austin on Wednesday. Battleground Texas said its data shows that, during early voting, nearly one out of every 25 voters under age 35 was registered by the group. Silva added that 69 percent of the people the group registered this year were voters of color, helping the electorate to begin to look more like the state’s overall minority-majority population. Republicans have noticed their work too. In the summer, Gov. Greg Abbott’s campaign team used training sessions for volunteers to warn that Harris County and other big metro areas in Texas have been trending toward Democrats, thanks in part to the work of Battleground Texas volunteers. Battleground Texas was first created in 2013 with the help of former campaign operatives who worked for former President Barack Obama. Their mission was to more aggressively register voters in Texas, a place that has a history of making it difficult to register to vote, Silva said. He said the group made gains in voter registration despite Texas laws that he says “criminalizes voter registration.” In Texas, groups cannot help voters register unless they go through specific training in counties they want to work in. If someone wants to register voters in another of the 254 counties in the state, they must get retrained in that county. And the training sessions vary from county to county. Silva said his group has more than 22,000 people who are certified to register people to vote in Texas. But Texas law requires all of those certifications to expire at the end of the cycle. All of those people must go through a new round of training to start registering voters again. Texas saw record-shattering voter registration since 2014. Since then, Texas saw its voter rolls grow by almost 1.8 million voters. In the four years prior to 2014, Texas added just 756,000 voters. The close margin of victory between Cruz and O’Rourke is something Cruz’s camp had been bracing for. Cruz chief strategist Jeff Roe told a conference of political consultants in Austin this week that in the closing weeks of the campaign, O’Rourke was surging. “Waking up on Election Day, I knew it was going to be close,” Roe said. He said the national environment was filled with stories about the Florida pipe-bomber sending packages to CNN and Democratic leaders. And then there were news accounts of the mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. Roe said internal polling showed O’Rourke getting another half point closer for each of the final 10 days of the race. “The last 10 days of the campaign was like nothing I’ve ever seen,” Roe said. O’Rourke really surged along the I-35 corridor. In the counties from Laredo to the Oklahoma border, O’Rourke beat Cruz by more than 440,000 votes. Four years earlier, Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn easily carried that corridor by more than 300,000 votes. Over the last 12 days of the campaign, O’Rourke made at least 25 stops in counties along the corridor, compared to three for Cruz.

339,https://www.ocregister.com/2018/12/18/thousand-oaks-mass-shooting-gunman-had-drugs-illegally-prescribed-by-tustin-doctor-feds-say/,"Trending: Authorities accused an Orange County doctor Tuesday of illegally distributing prescription drugs to at least five people who died of overdoses, and to a man charged last month with being under the influence when his vehicle fatally struck a Costa Mesa fire captain out for a morning bike ride. Federal prosecutors also alleged that medications prescribed by Dzung Ahn Pham, of Tustin, were found in the possession of a man believed to have carried out the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks that claimed the lives of 13 people. Pham, the owner of the Irvine Village Urgent Care, faces two federal counts of illegally distributing oxycodone. While he has not been criminally charged in connection to the Borderline shooting, the death of the Costa Mesa fire captain or the overdose deaths, authorities in a court filing alleged that he routinely gave out large quantities of powerful narcotics to dozens of patients. Pham appeared for a brief hearing at the federal courthouse in Santa Ana on Tuesday afternoon, but did not enter a plea. He was ordered to spend the night in jail and to return to court Wednesday. In announcing the charges, United States Attorney Nick Hanna described Pham, 57, as an example of  “drug dealers armed with prescription pads” and accused him of “flooding Southern California with huge quantities of opioids and other dangerous narcotics by writing prescriptions for drugs he knew would be diverted to the street.” The attorney who represented Pham in court on Tuesday did not comment on the charges. Investigators with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration allege that Pham sold prescriptions to phony patients whom he knew to be drug addicts willing to sell the narcotics on the black market. Authorities say a review of a state database showed that Pham gave out an “extremely high amount” of prescriptions over a three-year period. At least five people suspected of receiving and filling prescriptions from Pham died of drug overdoses, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Prosecutors noted that more than five years ago a CVS pharmacy in Irvine stopped accepting Pham’s prescriptions when he “could not justify the number of opioid pills he was prescribing to individual patients.” A Mission Viejo man charged in state court with the murder of 44-year-old Costa Mesa fire Capt. Mike Kreza, is believed to have been under the influence of drugs prescribed by Pham when his van collided with the off-duty fire chief, officials said. The Orange County District Attorney’s Office previously alleged that Stephen Taylor Scarpa, 25, was driving under the influence of a controlled substance when he veered into a bike lane along Alicia Parkway and struck the fire captains bicycle from behind. Federal prosecutors now say that Scarpa told investigators that “he was on medications prescribed by Pham.” They also allege that several prescription bottles with Pham’s name were found in Scarpa’s vehicle following the fatal crash. Scarpa’s attorney did not respond Tuesday to requests for comment. According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Pham also “expressed concern” in text messages after learning that prescriptions from him were found in the possession of Ian David Long, the gunman who carried out the Borderline Bar and Grill shooting in Thousand Oaks last month. In a text message cited by federal prosecutors, Pham is accused of telling another patient that Long had “my prescription bottles that belong to someone else.” “I never saw Mr. Long before, so I don’t know the implication of this information,” Pham wrote in the text message, according to prosecutors. “If its not his prescription you are clear ok, don’t worry,” the patient texted back, according to prosecutors. “Thats not on you, if i give my meds to some crazy person its on me, not you, you have no control over what happened after a patient leaves your office ok.” According to a sworn statement by a federal agent, more than 100 people texted Pham requesting prescription refills between Sept. 12 and Oct. 2, oftentimes dictating to Pham exactly what type of drug they wanted and in what quantity. “Hi dr pham, can you please have my script ready for pick up… 90 roxy, and 50 xanax, thank you,” the agent quoted one of the patients as texting Pham, noting that “Roxy” is a commonly used street name for a brand of oxycodone. The specific charges Pham is facing are tied to allegations that he issued oxycodone prescriptions to a woman he never saw as a patient. According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, a DEA agent during a pair of undercover operations “quickly and easily obtained prescriptions for narcotics” from Pham, including the so-called “triple threat” or “Holy Trinity,” a combination of opioids, tranquilizers and muscle relaxers. During the undercover operation, Pham is alleged to have “steered the undercover agent to an Irvine pharmacy that filled many of his prescriptions,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Prosecutors say Pham charged patients between $100 and $150 per office visit, and between 2013 and 2018 deposited more than $5 million, mostly in cash, to personal bank accounts held by him and his wife, as well as an additional $1.7 million that likely came from insurance payments into a business bank account. The investigation was carried out by the DEA’s Tactical Division Squad, with help from the Irvine Police Department and the IRS Criminal Division. Get the latest news delivered daily!

The commission, which was put together after the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., recommends in a report released Tuesday supporting a temporary order to take away guns from those deemed to be a danger to themselves and others, while respecting due process and ""Second Amendment liberties.""
Advertisement President Donald Trump said Tuesday the purpose of the report was ""to prevent school shootings and keep our children safe."" ""Nothing is more important than protecting our nation's children,"" Trump said.
RELATED Parkland panel advises arming teachers to handle school attacks The commission also recommends that school districts work with law enforcement to establish a method to have ""highly-trained individuals"" on campus with weapons. A senior administration official told reporters on a conference call Tuesday the report does not specifically recommend arming teachers, but said the average time of a mass shooting attack is three to four minutes -- and police response time is eight minutes, at the earliest.
Advertisement Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, told reporters the recommendations were made after the panel heard testimony from students, school officials, law enforcement and lawmakers around the country. ""The report addresses a holistic view of school safety based on the insights, experience and expertise of these individuals,"" DeVos said. ""We do not propose one-size-fits-all solutions for everyone. Local problems need local solutions. We have identified options policymakers should explore.""
RELATED March For Our Lives activists, others honored at Smithsonian awards DeVos said the report encourages better access to mental health services so people can receive the treatment they need, including a need to modernize federal privacy laws. One policy DeVos suggested Tuesday was one that doesn't identify or show photos of school shooters. It also urges school institutions to partner with local law enforcement in the training and arming of school personnel and placing veterans and retired law enforcement officers to serve in a variety of school roles. ""States and local communities should consider incentivizing these folks to pursue careers in education, as well as work to reduce barriers to certifications,"" DeVos said.
RELATED After Parkland: A timeline of gun-control activism, legislation Administration officials said the commission heard repeated discontent for Obama-era guidelines set in 2014 to alert school districts of potential civil rights law violations if black students or students of other racial minorities are suspended, expelled or disciplined in other ways at higher rates than white students.
Advertisement The commission chose to focus on the Obama guidelines partly because Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz, a former MSD student, was a participant in Broward County's Promise program, which provides an alternative to arrest for some students. ""One of the things that the commission was concerned with was the reoccurring narrative that teachers in the classroom, or students in the hallways, on campus were afraid because individuals who had a history of anti-social or aggressive, trending toward violent behavior were left unpunished or left unchecked,"" a senior administration official said. ""That's the first move the report makes is to correct for that problem."" Although the Florida Promise program was launched a year before the Obama guidelines were put into place, it has been viewed as an early example of the kind of initiatives schools may implement to lessen the racial disparities in regard to discipline. Tuesday's report also touched on other issues, like violent entertainment and school building security. Andrew Pollack, father of Parkland victim Meadow Pollack, joined Trump and DeVos in discussing the report at the White House referring to it as ""the most comprehensive report by any administration on a school shooting.""

The devices allow such weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms. | Rick Bowmer/AP photo gun control By ASSOCIATED PRESS 12/18/2018 11:22 AM EST Updated 12/18/2018 11:27 AM EST WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved Tuesday to officially ban bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms, and has made them illegal to possess beginning in late March. The devices will be banned under a federal law that prohibits machine guns, according to a senior Justice Department official. Bump stocks became a focal point of the national gun control debate after they were used in October 2017 when a man opened fired from his Las Vegas hotel suite into a crowd at a country music concert below, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The regulation, which was signed by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker on Tuesday morning, will go into effect 90 days after it is formally published in the Federal Register, which is expected to happen on Friday, the Justice Department official said. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly ahead of the regulation’s formal publication and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. In March, President Donald Trump said his administration would “ban” the devices, which he said “turn legal weapons into illegal machines.” 2020 elections By ALEX ISENSTADT Shortly after the president’s comments, the Justice Department announced that it had started the process to amend federal firearms regulations to define bump stocks as machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sought public comment on the proposal, drawing more than 35,000 comments. The amended regulations reverse a 2010 ATF decision that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress changed existing firearms law or passed a new one. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, there was a growing push by some members of Congress to ban bump stocks, but no legislation was passed. At least 10 states have sought their own restrictions on the devices. People who own bump stocks will be required to either surrender them to the ATF or destroy them by late March, the official said. The change has undergone a legal review and the Justice Department and ATF are ready to fight any legal challenge that may be brought, the official added. Police said the gunman in the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock, fired for more than 10 minutes using multiple weapons outfitted with target scopes and bump stocks. Paddock fatally shot himself after the shooting and there were 23 assault-style weapons, including 14 fitted with rapid-fire “bump stock” devices, strewn about the room near his body on the floor of his 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel. The largest manufacturer of bump stocks, Slide Fire Solutions, announced in April that it was going to stop taking orders and shutting down its website. The remaining stock of the devices is now being sold by another company, RW Arms, based in Fort Worth, Texas. Missing out on the latest scoops?

The award is given to a player who has a significant impact in the community, often helping those in need. For the Los Angeles Rams, their nominee is left tackle Andrew Whitworth, who has been instrumental in helping the people impacted by recent tragedies in California. “It’s one of the most amazing parts of what I get to do playing NFL football is to have the ability to really pay it forward and realize that this is a game that’s blessed me so much over and over again,” Whitworth said this week. “And if I can do anything to put a smile or make somebody’s day better, I feel like, to me, that’s more worth it than anything in the world. I hope my kids understand that, I continue to tell them that.” Whitworth stepped up immediately after the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, which is where many Rams call home and practice each week. He donated one of his paychecks to the families of those impacted by the tragedy, reacting immediately after hearing of the news. He also shared a moment with victims after the Rams’ win over the Chiefs in Week 11, doing anything he could to help even in the slightest bit. Earlier this year, Whitworth was named the NFL Community MVP for donating his game check. As a nominee, Whitworth will wear a decal on his helmet for the rest of the season. Last year, J.J. Watt won the award for his work after the devastating hurricane in the Houston area.

346,https://www.dailynews.com/2018/12/07/sheriff-bullet-that-killed-sergeant-likely-came-from-chp-officer-during-thousand-oaks-mass-shooting/,"Trending: The deputy sergeant killed during the Thousand Oaks mass shooting died from a bullet fired by a California Highway Patrol officer who was also trying to stop the suspect, Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said in a Friday news conference. The suspect’s gunfire hit Sgt. Ron Helus five times, but that gunfire was not necessarily fatal. “We are deeply saddened to inform you that Sgt. Helus was also struck by a sixth bullet, which we now know … was fired from the CHP officer’s rifle,” the sheriff said. “Tragically, that bullet struck vital organs and was fatal.” Authorities made the discovery when FBI crime-lab analysis showed that the lethal bullet matched the type that came from the officer’s weapon. Ayub said the news was “extremely difficult” to process and understand, particularly for Helus’ wife, Karen, and adult son Jordan. Dr. Christopher Young, Ventura County’s chief medical examiner, told reporters that the wounds from the suspect’s gunfire were “potentially survivable” but that the one from the officer hit his heart. Young previously said there was no evidence that the victims inside the Borderline were struck by gunfire from the CHP officer or Helus. “We were aware of the injuries sustained by Sgt. Helus, but we needed confirmation from ballistics and it wasn’t certain that it was friendly fire,” he said Friday. Ayub described the situation as chaotic and confusing that night, Nov. 7, with people running through the parking lot, jumping out windows to escape and many visibly bleeding amid the sound of shots ringing out as the officers approached the building. When Helus and the CHP officer entered, they were ambushed “almost immediately” by the gunman amid smoke, darkness and chaos, he said. Helus and the CHP officer, he said, willingly went into “what can only be described as a combat situation, risking their own lives to save many others.” “It’s a tragic detail that I don’t think was avoidable,” Ayub said. Officials would not discuss the position of the deputy, who was wearing a protective vest, and the CHP officer when the deputy was struck. They also did not say whether Helus was shot from the front or the back. Ayub said the circumstances of that fatal shot — whether the officer accidentally discharged his gun, for example, or was shooting at the suspect — were still under investigation.  Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said that Sgt. Ron Helus killed during the Thousand Oaks mass shooting, died from a bullet fired by a California Highway Patrol officer who was also trying to stop the suspect.

(Photo by Dean Musgrove, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG)  Ayub said two CHP officers were in the area that night when they saw victims fleeing from the bar. Helus, who received a report of shots fired and people down inside the bar, was dispatched to the area. After hearing shots fired, Helus and one of the CHP officers decided to enter the bar to stop the shooter, he added. Both Helus and the CHP officer entered nearly simultaneously, Ayub said. Helus “happened to be between the CHP officer and the gunman,” he said. LD Maples, chief of the California Highway Patrol’s Coastal Division, told reporters that he broke the news to the officer that it was his bullet that appeared to cause Helus’ death. “He was devastated,” Maples said. “(He’s) a consummate professional, well-trained with a military background.” The officer, a nine-year department veteran, was taking time off from duty. “The mere thought of something like this happening is devastating to all of us who are sworn to protect and save lives,” Maples said. The gunman who terrorized the packed Borderline Bar and Grill fired 50-plus rounds striking 13 victims, with only one surviving, and tossed smoke grenades, authorities have said. Ian David Long, 28, of Newbury Park had seven high-capacity, 30-round magazines in his possession, five of which were found fully loaded after the suspect fatally shot 12 people and then took his own life, the sheriff has said previously. His motive remains unknown. Long was a 28-year-old U.S. Marine veteran who had previously been at Borderline as a customer. Nearly two dozen other people were wounded in the chaos. The victims who were killed ranged in age from 18 to 54. They included a Pepperdine University student, a promoter for the bar who planned to join the U.S. Coast Guard, and an ex-Marine sergeant who dedicated his life to helping emotionally scarred veterans get back on their feet. Helus had a 29-year career and took on challenging assignments including narcotics investigator, firearms instructor and member of the SWAT team. Sheriff Ayub said the news about how Helus died does not diminish the “heroic actions” both men showed at the Borderline that night. “It’s important to remember that the horrific circumstances of the Borderline Bar and Grill on that Wednesday night, exactly one month ago today were caused by the evil actions of one individual, the man who murdered 12 people and injured 22 others,” Ayub said. “He alone created the violence and he alone bears the responsibility for his course of action.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

Just days after the Oct. 27 mass murder that took 11 lives at the Pittsburgh house of worship, the word ""antisemitism"" on the mural was erased; the phrase had read ""Antisemitism exists. Acknowledge it,"" the outlet said. Later, the memorial was vandalized with the phrase ""Palestine exists. Acknowledge it"" along with a painted Palestinian flag, the Syndicate reported.  The Claremont Independent noted that Walker Wall is considered a free-speech spot where messages are continually painted over with new ones. ""I find it frustrating that all Jewish issues have become so politicized on our campus,"" student Sam Lushtak — a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi, a well-known Jewish fraternity — told the outlet. ""Students feel like they can't be active as Jews, even with something as simple as having Shabbat, without being forced into getting involved in politics, especially with this controversial issue that often gets very personal if you don't hold a certain narrow set of beliefs."" Lushtak added to the Syndicate: ""It has a chilling effect on the Jewish community on a campus which prides itself on helping communities express themselves."" Student Hallie Goldstein added to the outlet that ""aside from a handful of outraged Jewish students, nobody is talking about this. Not our administrations, not our school newspapers, not our campus minority groups; no one.' ""What stings the most is that whenever any other minority group is targeted in some way, all five of our colleges are buzzing with conversation, with statements of condemnation, with student-written articles, and with support resources,"" she added to the Syndicate. ""However, it is [always] a double standard whenever Jews are the subject of a hate crime or discriminatory act."" Goldstein also told the outlet that despite the vandalism happening within ""an extremely well-educated, bright, passionate university demographic, people aren't giving this hate crime the attention it deserves. To me, that solidifies the fact that most of these students do not truly believe anti-Semitism is a problem, when in fact it surrounds us everywhere, both in implicit and explicit ways."" ""It has come to our attention that, in the past few days, a pro-Palestine statement was written over the 'antisemitism exists' piece on Walker Wall. The Claremont College's Students for Justice in Palestine does not condone derailing conversations about anti-semitism,"" the group said on its Facebook page. ""We find this especially unacceptable given that the statement about anti-semitism has already been defaced once before, and was written in response to the Tree of Life mass shooting that occurred this past October. Furthermore, this act has perpetuated a false narrative that positions Palestinian people against, and outside of, the Jewish community. Jewish Palestinians exist."" Claremont Students for Justice in Palestine added that it ""condemns all anti-semitism, and we stand proudly with our Jewish siblings."" The Claremont Colleges include Pomona College, Scripps College, Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, and Pitzer College. A Pomona College spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, the Syndicate said. ""All too frequently, Jewish students are blamed and targeted for harm with actions such as vandalism, harassment, and even assault, simply because of their presumed support for Israel,"" Tammi Rossman-Benjamin — founder and director for AMCHA, a group that documents and fights anti-Semitism — told the outlet. ""And frighteningly, this is a perfect example."" She added to the Syndicate that ""what makes matters worse is that while the anti-Semitism that comes from the extreme right is promptly acknowledged and condemned by university leaders, the anti-Israel anti-Semitism that comes from the extreme left, which is what we see a lot of on campus, is often excused as political speech and permitted.""

They wouldn’t even expect [the attack] in my area…” Joseph reportedly said. Joseph then began the process of choosing between two nearby Toledo, Ohio, synagogues. He wanted to pick “which one will have the most people, what time and what day,” he said. “Go big or go home.” He specifically expressed a wish to kill a rabbi, and showed photos of the places he was casing to FBI agents. After working with the agents to identify which weapons he could use to inflict the most casualties, he agreed to let them help him acquire two AR-15 assault rifles. When he came to retrieve the bag of weapons on December 7, he was arrested instead. Anti-Defamation League regional directorJeremy Pappas praised law enforcement “for working so diligently to prevent terror from hitting our community.” In a statement, he said “the Jewish community is still grieving following the October attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.

352,https://www.denverpost.com/2018/12/21/hickenlooper/,"Trending: To quote Lin-Manuel Miranda: “no one really knows how the parties get to yes, the pieces are sacrificed in every game of chess. We just assume it happens, but no one else is in the room where it happens.” For three years, I served as chief of staff — I was to Gov. John Hickenlooper what Alexander Hamilton was to General Washington. During that time, I had a seat behind the closed doors of the room where things happened. I watched Hickenlooper bring his entrepreneurial approach to government. He didn’t just say, there is no margin in making enemies, he practiced it. The secret sauce was his focus on collaboration and listening harder. Like the restaurant owner he was, he always made his decisions with the customers in mind. He figured out how to keep bringing people back to the table, and in doing so, he leaves as one of Colorado’s most popular governors ever. Many have tried to define him in a way that suits their own agenda. The truth is that he has accomplished some of the most progressive policy wins of any governor in the country and he did it in a purple state by making friends, not enemies, and working across party lines and industry groups to find success. It’s no accident that Colorado has the nation’s best economy, but his leadership goes way beyond the economy. As chair of the National Governors Association and the Western Governors Association, he acted in a moderate way to find meaningful solutions to a myriad of issues, like protecting the West’s sage grouse population. When Congress and President Donald Trump worked to repeal the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, he led efforts alongside Ohio Gov. John Kasich and other governors to make adjustments to stabilize insurance markets so millions of Americans and wouldn’t lose their health insurance. Colorado saw a significant reduction in teen births and abortion through convening a broad group of stakeholders and garnering republican support for long-acting reversible contraception. In 2013, after the Aurora theatre mass shooting, Hickenlooper supported some of the most progressive gun safety laws in the nation. Hickenlooper called a special session on civil unions and expanded LGBT rights. Many would like to point to his position on fracking to frame him as a conservative and overly friendly to the industry. That certainly wouldn’t tell the whole story. Working with the oil and gas industry, Colorado became the first state in the nation to capture methane emissions from oil and gas wells. He did this through constructive engagement with environmental groups and the oil and gas industry. But it’s how Hickenlooper responded to Trump’s reversal of President Obama’s commitment to addressing climate change that really shows the work he put in behind closed doors. I stood behind Hickenlooper at Red Rocks in 2017 when he signed an executive order compelling a greenhouse gas emissions cut before 2025 by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels. Long before that public event, however Hickenlooper recognized that with climate change local governments were already doing a lot of work on their own. He appreciated this as a former mayor, so he reached out to Sam Mamet of the Colorado Municipal League (CML) to see how he could connect with cities and counties across the state. Through many meetings with CML he forged a strong partnership that empowered local governments to get the support and resources they needed to craft their own plans. Those conversations continue today. Leading up to this moment, I sat with Hickenlooper as he and his team met with citizens, local, state and national leaders and advocacy groups to get their input and facts about what was attainable.  He wasn’t able to build a broad coalition to support these efforts, but he listened hard. Hickenlooper continuously made revisions to the language of the executive order. His goal was to do this right, not fast. He then invited his friend and Republican, the late and wonderful Mayor Steve Hogan, to join him at the signing ceremony as a signal that he took seriously the conservative contributions and commitments to cost savings and to give credit where credit was due. Ultimately, he set the pathway to rulemaking and created the infrastructure for continued progress. He also eventually declared that Colorado would join a U.S. Climate Alliance of states and companies countering Trump’s move towards withdrawing from the Paris climate change accord. He did this only after thoughtful consideration and a push for substantive action, rather than a message campaign. Make no mistake: I didn’t drink the Hick Kool-aid. There were many times I leaned in hard when I disagreed with his policy views, but I always respected where he landed. As he finishes off his term as governor of this great state, there can be no doubt that he left Colorado a better place than he found it.

353,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2018/11/29/trump-administration-set-ban-bump-stock-devices-guns/Gx5PTbp7UAntZBulCdF5YN/story.html?s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Atwitter,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is preparing to officially ban bump stocks on guns, a move that would put an end to the sale of attachments that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire faster and that would follow through on an order President Trump made this year to the Justice Department to regulate the devices. An administration official said Wednesday evening that a formal ban would be rolled out in the coming days to weeks, a timeline first reported by CNN. Trump, who has in recent weeks hinted that the ban would be coming, first called for the Justice Department to reexamine the regulations after a mass shooting in February at a Florida high school left 17 dead. Advertisement The president’s declaration set into motion a chain of events that surprised officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, which had already been tasked with reviewing whether the devices could be banned, a directive given after a massacre in Las Vegas in October 2017. In that mass shooting, the deadliest in modern history, a gunman using weapons outfitted with a bump stock device killed 58 people. The gunman fired off about 90 rounds in 10 seconds. As recently as last month, Trump said publicly that a ban would be coming. “So we’re knocking out bump stocks,” the president said during a news conference announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada. “I’ve told the NRA. I’ve told them: Bump stocks are gone.” He added: “And over the next couple of weeks, I’ll be able to write it up.” The initiative to ban bump stocks had been met with skepticism by Democratic lawmakers in Congress, who questioned whether the measure would be enough to combat the scourge of mass shootings. (The device was not used in the shooting in Florida, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.) The move also drew caution from lawmakers who said taking executive action on the devices could lead to court battles. Advertisement The National Rifle Association did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday evening, but the organization initially supported an ATF review of the devices after the Las Vegas shooting. At the same time, the gun association had also urged Congress to pass a law that would allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry the weapons in all 50 states. Though he has worked to push through a ban on bump stocks, Trump remains a vocal supporter of gun rights and the Second Amendment, frequently invoking it as under assault by Democrats.

President Donald Trump’s administration is set to ban bump stocks, which effectively let semiautomatic weapons mimic machine guns, in the coming days, according to reports from CNN and the New York Times. In March, the administration introduced a regulation that would ban the devices, essentially bringing bump stocks into a broader federal ban on machine guns. According to CNN, the new rule will force people who own bump stocks to turn in or destroy the devices within 90 days. The bump stock ban originally came up in response to the Las Vegas shooting last year, in which a shooter used the devices to kill 58 people and injure hundreds more. The gunman still may have carried out the shooting without bump stocks, but the devices made the shooting much deadlier by turning his semiautomatic weapons into guns that closely simulated automatics. Automatic weapons are what many Americans think of as machine guns. They can continuously fire off a stream of bullets if the user simply holds down the trigger, making them very deadly. Semiautomatic weapons, by contrast, fire a single bullet per trigger pull. The difference between an automatic and a semiautomatic effectively translates to firing hundreds of rounds a minute versus dozens or so in the same time frame. Under federal law, fully automatic weapons are technically legal only if made before 1986, when Congress passed the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act. So it’s illegal to manufacture new automatic weapons for civilian use. Bump stocks offer a way around the law, as the Associated Press explained shortly after the Las Vegas shooting: The device basically replaces the gun’s shoulder rest, with a “support step” that covers the trigger opening. By holding the pistol grip with one hand and pushing forward on the barrel with the other, the shooter’s finger comes in contact with the trigger. The recoil causes the gun to buck back and forth, “bumping” the trigger. Technically, that means the finger is pulling the trigger for each round fired, keeping the weapon a legal semi-automatic. There are other modifications that achieve a similar effect, including a crank that replaces the trigger and turns a gun into what a gun aficionado channel on YouTube called “a mini Gatling Gun.” Shortly after the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting in February, Trump called on the Justice Department to ban bump stocks and similar devices (although the Parkland shooting did not involve a bump stock). The Justice Department’s decision to do so came despite a reluctance that the Justice Department or Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) have the legal authority ban bump stocks and similar devices. The new regulation will likely face challenges in court. But even if it survives, there’s a big question of just how effective the ban will be. The bump stock ban is among several proposals Trump has made to tighten gun control after the Florida shooting, such as improving reporting to the background check system and raising the legal age for purchasing assault-style weapons from 18 to 21. Even if all these efforts were successful, it’s unclear just how much of an effect they would have — because they do little to quickly address the core problem behind US gun violence. The US is unique in two key — and related — ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far more guns than any other country in the world. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) Mass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America’s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2016. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, “The US makes up less than 5% of the world’s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.” The US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey. Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms. These two facts — on gun deaths and firearm ownership — are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths. “Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health. For example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level. This chart, based on data from researcher Josh Tewksbury, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths among wealthier nations: Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry during an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone. Gun control measures can help address this by reducing the number of people who own guns, whether over time or immediately. The research supports gun control: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives. But not all gun control is made equal. Consider the specifics of the US: If the key problem is that America has too many guns, then it needs to do something to reduce the number of guns in circulation quickly — something akin to Australia’s response to a mass shooting in the late 1990s, when the country passed sweeping restrictions on firearms and enacted what was effectively a gun confiscation program for certain types of weapons. That policy not only cut the number of guns in circulation but, based on the research, may have cut the firearm homicide and suicide rates too. The policies Trump has backed wouldn’t achieve that. They could over time reduce the number of guns in circulation — by imposing barriers that future would-be buyers won’t be able to overcome — but they don’t do anything to immediately take guns out of circulation. In fact, this is typical in US policy responses to guns: After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26, the bill Congress considered (but didn’t pass) would not have implemented even universal background checks, and it certainly wouldn’t have created a mandatory buyback program like Australia’s. None of that is to say that milder measures aren’t effective. Connecticut’s law requiring handgun purchasers to first pass a background check and obtain a license, for example, was followed by a 40 percent drop in gun homicides and a 15 percent reduction in gun suicides. Similar results — in the reverse — were reported in Missouri when it repealed its own permit-to-purchase law. There’s similar evidence for Massachusetts’s gun license system. And a review of the evidence by RAND also linked milder gun control measures, including background checks, to reduced injuries and deaths — and that means these measures likely saved lives. But if America wants to get to the levels of gun deaths that its European peers report, it will likely need to go much further. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

357,https://patriotpost.us/articles/59767-the-second-class-second-amendment-2018-11-30,"We pause our operations for a week in summer so our staff can recharge. We'll be back on the regular publication schedule on Monday, August 2. It’s past time for the Supreme Court to stop side-stepping any and all questions about gun rights. The Left has, over time, perpetuated the idea that the Bill of Rights, whose 10 amendments were designed to protect individual citizens from government tyranny, somehow includes a Second Amendment that empowers the government to determine when and where those citizens can carry weapons. But why would the Founders go to the trouble of ensuring such rights while allowing the government to snatch them away from an undefended population? Still, in 2008 the Supreme Court held 5-4 in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment was an individual right, a decision that former Justice John Paul Stevens called the worst of his tenure. The Federalist’s David Harsanyi writes, “Earlier this year, in fact, Stevens implored Americans to do what he couldn’t while on the court, and repeal the Second Amendment.” The fact that the Heller decision was even necessary reveals just how far we’ve fallen since our founding. The ruling came far too late to push back against decades of leftist propaganda and activism designed to convince millions of Americans that the Second Amendment was far different from the other nine rights — that it was neither individual nor narrowly limited but collective and extremely limited. Since then, lower courts have had a field day misinterpreting the Constitution and upholding laws making it harder for citizens to acquire guns. For example, in 2016 the infamous Ninth Circuit Court determined in Peruta v. California that one must show “good cause” in order to carry a concealed weapon. Sadly, these kinds of outrageous decisions are free to stand as long as the Supreme Court refuses to hear key cases rather than establishing strong precedents that would put the issue to rest. As John Yoo and James C. Phillips write at National Review, “Despite the text of the Second Amendment, supporters of a right to bear arms have rooted their arguments in a murky pre-constitutional right to self-defense. As a result, the Supreme Court has shied away from halting the spread of federal and state schemes for gun control, for which the cries will only rise higher after the recent mass shootings. Unless the new conservative majority on the Court, solidified by Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s arrival, places the right to bear arms on a par with the rest of the Bill of Rights, the coming blue wave of gun-control proposals may swamp what the Framers considered a core constitutional right.” Justice Clarence Thomas made this clear when he recently wrote, “The Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense. I do not think we should stand by idly while a State denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.” In order to clarify the intent of the framers, Second Amendment proponents cannot merely fall back onto the amendment itself, but must go back further to understand its history. We must arm ourselves with centuries of natural law and English common law principles in order to smash the collective-right theory of the 1960s. For now, conservatives are losing the public relations battle that works against the Second Amendment every time there’s a new mass shooting. And we had better act swiftly. Nancy Pelosi and company aren’t about to sit back when they take the reins from House Republicans in January. Mark Walters writes that, with Democrats in power, “We will see a renewed push for expanded background checks and a ban on so-called high capacity magazines. And I expect we will see some form of ‘assault weapons’ ban as well as a push for federal Extreme Risk Protection Orders and red flag laws. These red flag laws disarm American citizens by violating their due process rights based simply on an allegation that someone may be a danger to themselves or others.” All this would be of less concern if the Supreme Court and its new, more conservative majority would simply take up more Second Amendment cases and decisively reestablish the self-evident right of American citizens to defend themselves. Indeed, the High Court may be the last best hope for securing this right against a leftist obsession to take it away.

358,https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Houstonians-recall-Sandy-Hook-victims-and-push-13470805.php,"When a gunman killed 28 people in Sandy Hook Elementary School six years ago, Willie Johnson believed that gun safety laws would soon be reformed. “Then nothing was done,” Johnson said at a vigil for the victims. “I’m very upset… I’m just trying to figure out how many children have to die before the legislators do something.” As the state legislature prepares to convene, local clergy and the Metropolitan Organization on Sunday held a gun control vigil at Trinity United Methodist Church. Those present spoke passionately about gun safety policies. “Despite the fact that we’re supposed to be a first-world country, a civilized nation, a nation of laws, we continue to see the scourge of gun violence in the United States,” said Houston Police Department Chief Art Acevedo. In January, Acevedo will become president of Major Cities Chiefs, a group of the police chiefs from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, and said he would use the position to argue for implementing a universal background check and closing what’s known as the gun show loophole, which allows private individuals to sell and trade arms without background checks. “We are going to be a lot more vocal,” Acevedo said. While organizations such as Major Cities Chiefs are gearing up to advocate for change on a federal level, the Mayor’s Commission on Gun Violence has researched safety policies that the city, county and state can implement. One of the members of the commission, Abbie Kamin, pointed to the gun show loophole as an issue that could be acted upon locally. “That’s something the city can do immediately,” she said. As the roughly three dozen present remembered the tragedy, many expressed frustration at what they perceived as a lack of progress. Wasiq Javed, a freshman at the University of Houston, is also on the Mayor’s Commission on Gun Violence and spoke about the impact Sandy Hook had on him as a 12-year-old. “At that time, I didn’t understand what was going on, but I knew children had died, and I knew that I was just two years older than them — that my life could’ve been at risk,” he said. “What have we done in six years?” David Lyon, senior rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel, read an opinion piece he wrote for the Houston Chronicle in January of 2013. After every mass shooting in the years since, he has referred to the article and says he could still write it word for word. He eventually published a version for his congregation with blanks instead of the words “Sandy Hook” so that members could fill in the name of the latest disaster. “Our purpose here is to stop filling in the blanks and change the narrative,” Lyon said. For the Ed Jones, the pastor of Trinity United Methodist Church, the urgency of the vigil that he had been planning for months had been underscored by personal tragedy that very week. A family member, 17-year-old Drew Conley, had been shot and killed the Monday before. “He should’ve played football in the playoffs Friday night,” Jones said, of Conley, a Fort Bend Marshall defensive back. “Sometimes we don’t think about this issue until it knocks on your door,” Jones said about gun safety. “And sadly, sadly it has knocked on many doors. It hurts my heart.” rebecca.schuetz@chron.com; twitter.com/raschuetz R.A. Schuetz covers real estate for the Houston Chronicle.

Abdul Aziz and Farah Naz, the parents of Sabika Sheikh, who was 17, joined a lawsuit filed in a Galveston County court. The suit was brought by family members of some of the people killed at Santa Fe High School and alleges that the parents of suspect Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 18, were negligent and irresponsibly stored their firearms. ""Sabika's picture is in front of our eyes every single moment, and her voice and laughter echo in our ears,"" Aziz and Naz said in a statement. ""For a mother and a father, this trauma and mourning stay until their last breath,"" they said. ""We are grateful to everyone in the U.S. and around the world who met us in person and reached us through emails, print, electronic and social media to express solidarity and empower us to endure this most profound tragedy."" Sheikh was one of eight students and two substitute teachers killed in the school shooting. Police have said Pagourtzis entered the school armed with a shotgun and revolver, weapons owned by his parents. Authorities said Pagourtzis also had explosive devices that failed to detonate. Sheikh's parents filed their legal claims days before what would have been their daughter's 18th birthday. Before her death, Sheikh was less than three weeks away from returning home to Pakistan after spending a year as an exchange student in the United States. She was a youth ambassador with the U.S. State Department sponsored Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Program, which is administered by the American Councils for International Education, the American Institute for Foreign Study Foundation and I*Earn. The lawsuit alleges that Pagourtzis' parents, Antonios Pagourtzis and Rose Marie Kosmetatos of Galveston, failed to respond to and address warning signs that their son posed a risk to others. Ron Rodgers, a League City-based attorney defending Pagourtzis' parents in the lawsuit, said in a statement that he is confident his clients were not negligent and ""could not have predicted what occurred."" ""My clients are truly heartbroken over the horrific loss of Ms. Sheikh and all of the victims of the May 18th tragedy, and our hearts go out to their families and the community,"" Rodgers said. ""While it is perhaps natural for those looking for someone to blame for the acts of a child to point the finger at the parents, the fact is that many of the allegations concerning my clients are either inaccurate or wholly untrue. The legal theories they are putting forward are premised on facts that just aren't there."" Sheikh's parents, who live in Karachi, Pakistan, are represented by Everytown for Gun Safety's litigation team and by attorney Clint E. McGuire of Martinez and McGuire PLLC in Houston. McGuire did not respond to a request for comment. Shaheerah Albasit, Sheikh's cousin and a graduate student living in Washington, D.C., said the fact that Sheikh's parents live abroad made it logistically difficult for them to join the lawsuit right away. Albasit hoped the lawsuit would contribute to the nationwide dialogue around ending gun violence. ""Our motivation behind (the lawsuit) is that this will contribute to increasing a sense of accountability, not just to gun owners when it comes to safe storage and responsible storage of their weapons, but also in people around them that display signs of harming themselves and harming others and to be more cognizant about them, and to take measures to ensure that they do not end up doing what (Pagourtzis) did,"" Albasit said. Pagourtzis remains in custody in Galveston County without bail, charged with capital murder and a first-degree felony charge of aggravated assault on a peace officer in the wounding of Santa Fe Independent School District Officer John Barnes. Pagourtzis is eligible for a life sentence if convicted, and could be eligible for parole in 40 years. A federal investigation into the Santa Fe shooting is ongoing.

Sandy Hook: Five years later, victims' families find new purpose — -- Six years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, here is a look back at the 20 children and six educators who lost their lives that day. Charlotte Bacon, 6 Charlotte dreamed of being a veterinarian when she grew up. The 6-year-old ""never met an animal she didn't love,"" read her obituary. The lively first-grader also enjoyed practicing taekwondo with her brother, Guy, and her father. ""Charlotte was an extraordinarily gifted 6-year-old who filled her family each day with joy and love. The family will forever remember her beautiful smile, her energy for life and the unique way she expressed her individuality, usually with the color pink,"" read her obituary. Daniel Barden, 7 Daniel was the youngest of three children, his family said in a statement. The family described Daniel as ""fearless in the pursuit of happiness in life."" ""Words really cannot express what a special boy Daniel was. Such a light. Always smiling, unfailingly polite, incredibly affectionate, fair and so thoughtful towards others, imaginative in play, both intelligent and articulate in conversation: in all, a constant source of laughter and joy,"" the family added. Rachel D'Avino, 29 Rachel D'Avino was a behavioral therapist who had only recently started working at Sandy Hook Elementary School, her friend Lissa Lovetere Stone told The Associated Press. Police told her family that D'Avino shielded one of the students during the rampage, Lovetere Stone told the AP. Olivia Engel, 6 The 6-year-old was just learning the rosary and would lead the family in grace every night before dinner, The New Haven Register reported. Her favorite colors were pink and purple. ""She was a great big sister and was always very patient with her 3-year-old brother, Brayden,"" her cousin John Engel told the paper. ""Her father said she was a 6-year-old who had a lot to look forward to."" Josephine Gay, 7 Josephine Gay ""was known for her love of all things purple,"" read her obituary, which asked those who attended her funeral to wear the color in her honor. ""She lived seven years, inspiring friends and family with her beautiful smile, loving heart and playful spirit,"" read her obituary, which also said that family and friends described her as ""a gift."" Dylan Hockley, 6 ""Everyone who met Dylan fell in love with him. His beaming smile would light up any room, and his laugh was the sweetest music. He loved to cuddle, play tag every morning at the bus stop with our neighbors, bounce on the trampoline, play computer games, watch movies, the color purple, seeing the moon and eating his favorite foods, especially chocolate. He was learning to read and was so proud when he read us a new book every day. He adored his big brother Jake, his best friend and role model,"" his family wrote on a website started in his honor. Dylan had special needs, his parents wrote, and he died in the arms of his aide, Anne Marie Murphy. The family praised Murphy, principal Dawn Hochsprung, psychologist Mary Sherlach and his teacher Victoria Soto for truly knowing him. All four educators died in the massacre. Madeleine Hsu, 6 According to her obituary, Madeleine was a ""shy, quiet little girl who loved dogs."" ""She was just an absolute doll,"" a neighbor, Karen Dryer, told The Associated Press. ""She seemed very shy, but she was just so sweet."" Catherine Hubbard, 6 Catherine Hubbard was ""a beautiful child who will be remembered for her love of all animals, her beautiful red hair and her constant smile,"" read the website of the foundation that was started in her honor. Chase Kowalski, 7 ""Chase was an amazing son, brother and grandson [whose] heart was only filled with love for all the people he touched,"" read his obituary. ""Chase loved to read and write, he would go for little hikes in the yard and find feathers and tape them in a journal and write his letters on the pages trying to describe the items,"" his family wrote on the website of the foundation started in his memory. He loved to run from an early age, his family said. Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, 47 Hochsprung was the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School and, by all accounts, was devoted to her students and teachers. ""Dawn was a dedicated teacher who inspired her students to reach their fullest potential by instilling in them the importance of life-long learning. A fierce leader and educational activist, Dawn was admired by her colleagues, students and parents, particularly for her caring and nurturing nature. She often referred to her students as her 'children' and wanted school to be a positive place and a safe haven,"" read her obituary. ""When we had our orientation, you could tell she loved her job,"" Brenda Lediski, a parent, told ABC News in 2012. Jesse Lewis, 6 ""Jesse McCord Lewis was an amazing child, full of light and love that was unmistakable in his presence. He brought joy to the world with his infectious and radiant smile,"" read his obituary, which said he died trying to save other children. ""If you met Jesse once, he would leave an indelible mark on your heart,"" his obituary stated. ""The picture that remains etched in our souls is one of him in his boots, no socks, ripped jeans and a t-shirt, an army helmet strapped to his head, a smudge of dirt on his cheek, tromping through the pasture on his way from one adventure to another."" Ana Marquez-Greene, 6 Ana, the daughter of a jazz musician, loved music, according to her obituary. ""Ana's love for singing was evident before she was even able to talk. In a musical family, her gift for melody, pitch and rhythm stood out remarkably. She never walked anywhere! Her mode of transportation was dance. She danced from room to room and place to place. She danced to all the music she heard, whether in the air or in her head,"" her obituary stated. James Mattioli, 6 ""An energetic, loving friend to all, James loved baseball, basketball, swimming, arm wrestling and playing games on the iPad,"" read his obituary. ""He loved to wear shorts and t-shirts in any weather and grab the gel to spike his hair. He would often sing at the top of his lungs and once asked, 'How old do I have to be to sing on a stage?'"" his obituary stated. ""He loved and admired his big sister and wanted to do everything that she could do. They were the best of friends, going to school together, playing games together and making endless drawings and crafts together."" Grace Audrey McDonnell, 7 The artistic 7-year-old dreamed of living on Massachusetts' Martha's Vineyard and being a painter when she grew up. ""We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support from so many people,"" her family said in a statement in 2012. ""Our daughter Grace was the love and light of our family. Words cannot adequately express our sense of loss."" Anne Marie Murphy, 52 Anne Marie Murphy was employed as a special education teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The devoted mother and teacher died with one of her beloved students, Dylan Hockley, in her arms, Hockley's family said in a statement. ""She will be remembered for her love of the arts, walks in the outdoors and most importantly: her family,"" read her obituary. Emilie Parker, 6 Emilie Parker would have been one of the first to comfort her classmates at Sandy Hook Elementary School, had a gunman's bullets not claimed her life, her father said. ""My daughter Emilie would be one of the first ones to be standing and giving her love and support to all those victims, because that's the type of person that she is,"" her father, Robbie Parker, said after the shooting. ""We find comfort in reflecting on the incredible person Emilie was and how many lives that she was able to touch in her short time here on earth,"" he added. Jack Pinto, 6 ""Jack was an incredibly loving and vivacious young boy, appreciated by all who knew him for his lively and giving spirit and steely determination,"" read his obituary. ""In life and in death, Jack will forever be remembered for the immeasurable joy he brought to all who had the pleasure of knowing him, a joy whose wide reach belied his six short years."" Jack was a fan of New York Giants and their wide receiver Victor Cruz, who paid tribute to the 6-year-old during a game against the Atlanta Falcons in December 2012. Cruz wrote on his cleats, ""Jack Pinto, my hero,"" and ""R.I.P. Jack Pinto,"" ESPN reported. Cruz traveled to Newtown to meet Jack's family. ""When you hear a kid that is such a big fan of you and such a big fan of the Giants and the team, and I was his favorite player, I felt like it was only right that I pay my respects to him and be as comforting to that family as much as I can,"" Cruz told ESPN in 2012. Noah Pozner, 6 ""Noah was an impish, larger-than-life little boy. Everything he did conveyed action and energy through love. He was the light of our family, a little soul devoid of spite and meanness,"" read his obituary. Noah's twin sister, Arielle, who was in another class, survived. Caroline Previdi, 6 ""Caroline was our bright-eyed and cheerful little girl,"" her family wrote on the website of the foundation started in her honor. ""The word that comes to mind when we think about her is 'joyful.' She found delight in the smallest things in life and often exclaimed things like, 'Isn't that wonderful?' We sometimes marveled at her sheer enthusiasm and zest for life. It wasn't difficult for her to elicit smiles from family, friends and even people we passed in a store; her lighthearted nature was contagious."" Jessica Rekos, 6 ""Jessica Rekos was a beautiful 6-year-old girl who made us laugh every single day. She was smart, quick-witted and compassionate,"" her mother, Krista Rekos, wrote on the website of the foundation dedicated to her. She loved to ride horses, her family said, and her family promised to buy her a horse for her 10th birthday. Her mother wrote of the day Jessica was killed, ""As her school bus approached our bus stop on the morning of December 14th, Jessica and I were discussing how to sell Girl Scout Cookies. This would be Jessica's first time selling, and she could not wait for January when we could 'officially' start making phone calls to friends and family. Jessica hopped out of the car as the bus approached and excitedly walked up the bus stairs. She sat in the front seat, looked at me through the window, and smiled and waved as the bus pulled up the hill."" Avielle Richman, 6 ""Avielle had a grand spirit of adventure and was willing to bravely try new things,"" read the website of the foundation her family started in her honor. ""She had no problem transitioning from playing with her dolls to practicing archery in the yard and was happy to go from a kung fu workout with dad to a cooking lesson with mom. Avielle loved music and would sing everything."" ""Avielle was a connoisseur of parks and playgrounds, played soccer and went to summer sports camp (where she was the only girl to enroll), painted and sketched, ran and hiked, enjoyed fishing and — perhaps most of all — riding horses and swimming. Avielle's sense of wonder, inherent in all children, drove her to love the magic of fireflies and all things that glowed."" Lauren Rousseau, 30 Lauren Rousseau worked as a substitute teacher before landing a full-time substitute teaching position at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, The Danbury News-Times reported. For the 30-year-old, it was a dream job. ""It was the best year of her life,"" Teresa Rousseau, Lauren Rousseau Rousseau's mother and a copy editor at the News-Times, told the paper. Mary Sherlach, 56 Sherlach had worked at Sandy Hook Elementary School since 1994 ""doing what she termed 'God's work' by helping children who needed her the most,"" read her obituary. She and her husband, Bill Sherlach, had been married for 31 years and had two adult daughters. ""Mary is remembered as a loving wife and mother and a caring soul who was always there to lend an ear or a shoulder to someone in need,"" her obituary stated. The American Psychological Association published a tribute to Sherlach in 2013. ""Every day that I've known her, she has done everything in her power to take care of children, in ways large and small,"" Bob Lichtenstein, a former colleague of hers, told the APA in 2013. Victoria Soto, 27 Victoria Soto, 27, loved being a teacher, her cousin Jim Wiltsie told ABC News in 2012. She died trying to save children, he said. ""The family was informed that she was trying to shield, get her children into a closet and protect them from harm, and by doing that put herself between the gunman and the children,"" Wiltsie said. ""And that's when she was tragically shot and killed."" ""Her life dream was to be a teacher. And her instincts kicked in when she saw there was harm coming to her students. It brings peace to know that Vicki was doing what she loved, protecting the children,"" he added. ""And in our eyes, she is a hero."" Benjamin Wheeler, 6 ""Ben was an irrepressibly bright and spirited boy whose love of fun and excitement at the wonders of life and the world could rarely be contained,"" read his obituary. ""His rush to experience life was headlong, creative and immediate. He was a devoted fan of his older brother, Nate, and the two of them together filled the house with the noise of four children."" ""He loved the Beatles, lighthouses and the number 7 train to Sunnyside, Queens,"" his obituary stated, and he told his mother before school, ""I still want to be an architect, but I also want to be a paleontologist, because that's what Nate is going to be, and I want to do everything Nate does."" Allison Wyatt, 6 ""Allison was a kind-hearted little girl who had a lot of love to give, and she formed special bonds with most people who spent any amount of time with her. She loved her family and teachers especially, but would often surprise us with random acts of kindness — once even offering her Goldfish crackers to a complete stranger on a cross-country flight,"" her parents wrote on the website of the memorial fund started in her honor. ""She was a sweet, creative, funny, intelligent little girl who had an amazing life ahead of her. Our world is a lot darker now that she's gone, but we have been finding signs of her everywhere and know that she will always be with us,"" her parents added. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2018-12-14 13:00:20, Remembering the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
363,https://www.chron.com/news/article/Year-in-Deer-Park-filled-with-landmarks-13458307.php,"Deer Park’s elected officials saw a change in address this year with the opening of a new City Hall. After an eventful 2017 in Deer Park that featured milestones such as a yearlong 125th anniversary celebration, voter approval of a major school bond package and a tense test from Hurricane Harvey, it seemed that this year might serve as a quiet aftermath. But 2018, too, will factor prominently in the community’s history, with highlights such as the opening of a much-needed new City Hall and the start of two unprecedented commercial projects to boost local office space and provide jobs. In Deer Park ISD, the district received its first rating, albeit unofficial, in a new state letter-grade system. In some ways, this year saw continuation of earlier initiatives, such as more planning to protect neighborhoods against flooding and a push to boost school security using funds from a Deer Park ISD bond package approved the previous fall. Post-Harvey planning Memories remained fresh of how flooding caused by unprecedented rain from Harvey sent water into approximately 300 homes in Deer Park in August 2017. Although city staff members said that previous drainage projects prevented the damage from being much worse, Deer Park this year studied how to improve stormwater management systems and budgeted funds toward that goal while seeking federal money to help. “All of this is related back to Harvey,” Assistant City Manager Gary Jackson said. “Our priority is infrastructure, flood control and stormwater management systems. After a historic rain event like Harvey, it makes sense that this is where you would want to put those funds.” Deer Park is awaiting word on a request for upwards of $3 million in federal Housing and Urban Development funds that could be allocated through community development block grants via the state to spend on flood control. But that money will be tied to conditions such as a requirement that it be spent only in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods. So, the city has a $1.5 million budget in its capital improvements fund for fiscal year 2018-19 for any work needed in six vulnerable parts of the community that don’t meet the criteria for grant funds, according to City Manager James Stokes. School safety, academic performance Another event that sent shock waves through the community — the May 18 mass shooting at Santa Fe High School — put renewed interest in the security component of a $156 million Deer Park ISD bond approved by voters in November 2017. Stephen Harrell, the district’s assistant superintendent for administration, noted that the bond provides $3 million to upgrade security at all the district’s campuses. Surveillance camera upgrades for each campus were planned as the first part of that package to be put into place. Because of a waiver due to Hurricane Harvey, Deer Park ISD did not get an official letter-grade rating through a new state accountability system, but the district did receive a unofficial overall number score of 86 out of 100, with the district’s 14 campuses faring well overall on individual scores at the campus level. Deer Park ISD will receive its first official letter grade in the A-through-F system in 2019 after the Hurricane Harvey exemption is lifted. The total student enrollment in the district for the 2017-18 school year was 12,904, with 46 percent classified as economically disadvantaged. In a May election, Deer Park ISD voters re-elected Jason Cable to the school board in a landslide. Other incumbents up for election, Rhonda Leigh Lowe and Albert Lee Giddings, ran unopposed. New City Hall The $5.53 million, 25,000-square-foot new City Hall was built after the city determined that repairing the former city headquarters would not be cost-effective. The new building features the city secretary’s office, human resources, public works, permitting, central collections and utility billing on the first floor, and administration, engineering, information technology, public works administration and finance on the second. Two business projects Construction started this year on two developments scheduled to bring jobs and help address a shortage of local office space. Together, Underwood Port Logistics Center at 4600 Underwood and Victory Commerce Center, 2851 Pasadena Blvd., will add more than 800,000 square feet of office/distribution space to the 10-square-mile city. Both are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2019. “It will easily bring hundreds of jobs,” predicted Debbie Westbeld, the city’s economic development director. “We’re very underserved when it comes to office space in Deer Park,” she said. “To have 800,000 square feet suddenly appear is unheard of in Deer Park and very much needed.” At 303,160 square feet, the Underwood Port facility will be the largest commercial building in the city, Westbeld said. The city saw seven restaurants open in 2018, including Brick Oven Pizza Co. The Cuban Cafe and Krab Kingz Seafood. The 25-year partnership between Royal Dutch Shell and Mexico's state oil company in Deer Park was extended this year until at least until 2033, ensuring for Shell guaranteed supplies of heavy crude. Shell's nearly 90-year-old Deer Park refinery became a joint venture in 1993 when Petróleos Mexicanos, called Pemex, bought a 50-percent stake. Shell celebrated its 90th anniversary in Deer Park, and the longtime shared history between the company and city was a focus of an exhibit on the local role of the petrochemical industry, “Big Energy: A Texas Tale of People Powering Progress,” which opened in the fall at The San Jacinto Museum of History in La Porte. Nature center Ground-breaking occurred for the Deer Park Nature Preserve. a 38-acre facility on city-owned land at the northeast corner of East Boulevard and 13th Street that will serve as an educational resource and restore much of a former wetlands area. In describing the vision for the multiphase project, Mayor Jerry Mouton heralded that it would create “an educational oasis for Deer Park” where residents and students can use trails and learn about nature. The park, which will include trails and a sensory garden, is expected to open in the first quarter of 2019, said Jacob Zuniga, the city’s assistant director for parks and recreation. EMS building planned The city of Deer Park also is planning to build an emergency medical services facility, with completion of the project anticipated around late 2019. The city’s Fire Control Prevention and Emergency Medical Services District previously authorized design work for the 9,000-square-foot station, which will include administrative offices, personnel quarters, a living area and three drive-through bays that would each accommodate up to two vehicles, according to Robert Hemminger, the city’s director of emergency services. The proposed site is city property north of Fire Station No. 3 on East Boulevard. The district has allocated approximately $2.5 million toward project costs. Deaths Deaths of notable local residents in 2018 included that of Franklin “Bubba” McLean on July 3, a longtime leader in Deer Park ISD who had been a standout high school athlete, 17-year trustee and a lifelong supporter of the district. Remembering McLean as a star high school player in the 1950s who later became a Junior College All-American before playing football at Texas A&M University, his lifelong friend, former Deer Park Mayor Jimmy Burke, said, “What Bubba and his friends (athletes) and all of us that went to school at that time accomplished is that it really solidified Deer Park as a community.” Joe S. Cathey, a former Deer Park ISD trustee who served for 25 years and afterward was a familiar presence at district athletic events, died in early June. “We’ve been blessed with an outstanding school board for many years now, but folks like Mr. Cathey helped establish that tradition of excellent leadership,” Deer Park ISD spokesman Matt Lucas said.",2018-12-19 01:00:00,Year in Deer Park filled with landmarks,,10,http://www.chron.com/
364,https://abcnews.go.com/US/domestic-violence-plays-role-mass-shootings-receives-attention/story?id=59418186,"But too often, domestic violence doesn't receive the same media attention. News headlines today: Jan. 7, 2019 For many, the term ""mass shooting"" conjures up a random attack in which a lone gunman opens fire, often for unknown reasons. However, there have been just as many deadly mass shootings this year in which the shooter knew the victim, in many cases intimately, including instances of husbands killing their wives and children, or former partners killing their ex-girlfriends and other family members. The FBI defines a mass shooting as an incident where four or more people -- not including the suspect -- are killed. While there is no publicly accessible federal tracker of such incidents, various groups and watchdog organizations keep their own lists, often using different definitions of what qualifies as a mass shooting. Of the 20 mass shootings that ABC News identified in 2018 that fit the FBI's parameters, 10 were instances of either intimate partner or family violence, both of which are forms of domestic violence. Seven of those 10 cases involved men fatally shooting either their girlfriend, wife, or ex-partner, along with at least three other people. Some of those other victims were relatives of the female victim; others were bystanders. Two of the 10 cases involved a familial homicide, with parents or children shooting their direct relatives. And in one case studied by ABC News, the male suspect kill his ex-partner's four young children. In another case, a mother killed her own children. But too often, domestic violence doesn't receive the same media attention as other types of shootings, say many domestic violence and gun control advocacy groups. “For so long, we’ve seen domestic violence as a personal issue – it happens in the home, don’t talk about it – but mass shootings show us otherwise,” said Bryan Pacheco, the spokesperson Safe Horizon, a crime and abuse victims' services agency. “These are not just personal issues. These are community issues that we all should be tackling.” “The ability to help and support one survivor has the potential to save so many lives,” he added. John Cohen is a former Homeland Security official and current criminal justice professor who also works as an ABC News contributor. Cohen said that while it was not uncommon in the past for spurned partners to be violent towards their significant others, many of these incidents now involve powerful weapons and multiple bystander casualties. “Unlike in years past when they may go into a location and harm that person, instead they're going into a school, a workplace, a house of worship, and they're seeking to address their grievance by shooting a large group of people,” Cohen said. He specifically cited the deadly 2017 shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. In that incident, the shooter went to the church after allegedly expressing anger towards his mother-in-law, who was a parishioner. The suspect went to the church looking for his relatives but ended up killing 26 people before killing himself, authorities said. In November, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime released a report on the threats facing women around the world, showing that some of their greatest and deadliest dangers are at home. The UN report found that 58 percent of women who were intentionally killed around the world in 2017 were killed by intimate partners or family members. The report notes that globally, men are about four times more likely to be the victims of intentional homicide, but the share of women as victims goes up dramatically when looking specifically at violence perpetrated by an intimate partner or family member. In those cases, 64 percent of victims of intimate partner- or family-related homicide are women, compared to the 36 percent of victims who are male. That percentage increases further for intimate partner homicide, as the report found that in those cases, 82 percent of victims are female and 18 percent are male. The youngest victims of the deadly mass shootings this year were all killed in domestic violence incidents. In June, a man killed his two children –- ages 1 and 6 –- as well as his girlfriend’s other children –- ages 10 and 12 –- following a hostage situation in Florida before killing himself. And the month before, a father killed his three children -- ages 4, 6, and 8 -- as well as his ex-wife’s new boyfriend. The suspect killed himself in front of his ex right after killing her boyfriend, she told The Huffington Post. Pacheco said “people can’t fathom” instances where suspects kill their children, but it fits with the issues at hand in domestic violence cases. “Domestic violence is about power and control and what’s the most terrible thing you can do to a mother or a father – usually a mother – is to harm their children,” he said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2018-12-02 09:02:08," Mass shootings related to domestic violence often receive less attention, experts say",,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

WH: School safety commission 'activated' in wake of Texas school shooting The Washington state teen who garnered national headlines after being turned in by his own grandmother over plans to commit a mass school shooting pleaded guilty to the charges on Thursday. Joshua O’Connor pleaded not guilty to the charges when he was arrested in February, but submitted a new plea Thursday after coming to an agreement over the charges, according to Seattle ABC affiliate KOMO. He has been in custody since his arrest on Feb. 14, the same day as the Parkland school massacre, held on $5 million bond. O'Connor pleaded guilty to three charges on Thursday: first-degree attempted murder, first-degree robbery with a firearm and possession of explosive device. As part of the plea agreement, the prosecutor agreed to drop a weapons allegation on the attempted murder charge, according to KOMO. ""We do believe that it was important for Mr. O'Connor to take responsibility for what he did and be held legally accountable for the steps that he took,"" said Andrew Alsdorf, Snohomish County deputy prosecutor. The 18-year-old could face up to 28 years in prison when he faces sentencing in February 2019. O'Connor's grandmother, Catherine O'Connor, called police in February after discovering her grandson's journal, which outlined a plot to carry out a shooting at Aces Alternative High School in Everett, Washington. ABC News obtained a 911 call from Catherine O'Connor alerting police to the shooting plot. ""What I'm reporting is I'm finding journal entries from my grandson,"" Catherine O’Connor told the operator. ""And he's planning on having a mass shooting at one of the high schools."" At the time, KOMO obtained court documents detailing his violent journal entries. “I need to make this shooting/bombing ... infamous,"" the student wrote, according to the court documents. ""I need to get the biggest fatality number I possibly can. I need to make this count. ... I'm learning from past shooters/bombers mistakes, so I don't make the same ones."" When police responded to the house, they found an AK-47 and grenades, police said. The armed robbery charge O'Connor pleaded guilty to stemmed from robbing a convenience store prior to the arrest for planning the school shooting. O'Connor was arrested just hours after Nikolas Cruz allegedly opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 students and teachers.

366,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/santa-tracker-run-government-shutdown-59984306,"Hundreds of volunteers are ready to answer the phones when children from around the world call to ask when Santa will bring presents to their house _ despite the federal government shutdown DENVER -- The government may be partially shut down, but that won't stop hundreds of volunteers dressed in Christmas hats and military uniforms Monday from taking calls from children around the world who want to know when Santa will be coming. The military says the NORAD Tracks Santa won't be affected by the government shutdown because it is run by volunteers Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado and is funded by the Department of Defense's budget that was approved earlier this year. Now in its 63rd year, the Santa tracker became a Christmas Eve tradition after a mistaken phone call to the Continental Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1955. CONAD, as it was known, had the serious job of monitoring a far-flung radar network for any sign of a nuclear attack on the United States. When Col. Harry Shoup picked up the phone that day, he found himself talking not to a military general, but to a child who wanted to speak to Santa Claus. A Colorado Springs newspaper had run an ad inviting kids to call Santa but mistakenly listed the hotline number. Shoup figured out what had happened and played along. The tradition has since mushroomed into an elaborate operation that attracts tens of thousands of calls every year. For the 1,500 civilian and military volunteers who will answer the phones for kids calling 1-877-HI-NORAD, it infuses the holiday with childlike wonder. ""They're all really sweet, small voices,"" said Madison Hill, a volunteer who helped answer the phones in two previous years. ""I had a little girl tell me good night instead of goodbye,"" she said. ""It's really sweet."" The North American Aerospace Defense Command — a joint U.S.-Canadian operation based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that protects the skies over both countries — has taken over the Santa tracker since the tradition started. The military command center embraced and expanded the Santa-tracking mission and has been rewarded with a bounty of goodwill and good publicity. Last year,         NORAD Tracks Santa drew 126,000 phone calls, 18 million website hits, 1.8 million followers on Facebook and 179,000 more on Twitter. It takes 160 phones to handle the calls that pour in. New volunteers get a playbook that briefs them on the questions kids might ask. Big screens on the walls show a Santa icon making blistering progress around the globe. U.S. and Canadian officers do live TV interviews from the phone rooms. ""It really gets you into the Christmas spirit,"" said Hill, a student at Mississippi State University who got involved through Air Force family members stationed in Colorado Springs. ""There are Christmas carols in the background, everyone's very friendly, happy to be there,"" she said. One year, she took a call from a boy who began reading a very long Christmas list. ""I remember having to cut him off after the 10th present or so,"" she said, explaining to him that she had to take calls from other children. A girl told Hill she wanted to warn Santa not to bump into a bell hanging on her door. ""I think she wanted Santa to be quiet and not wake her up,"" Hill said. Sometimes the volunteers have to handle the unexpected. In 2012, a child from Newtown, Connecticut, asked if Santa could bring extra toys for families who lost children in the mass shooting that year at Sandy Hook Elementary. ""If I can get ahold of him, I'll try to get the message to him,"" replied the volunteer, Sara Berghoff. NORAD's commander, Air Force Gen. Terrence J. O'Shaughnessy, will also take a turn answering the phones Monday. ""This is my first NORAD Tracks Santa,"" said O'Shaughnessy, who took command in May. ""I'm really excited."" O'Shaughnessy was even asked about the program during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in April to confirm him as NORAD chief. ""I assume this committee can count on your commitment to continue that venerable tradition,"" Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton deadpanned. ""Yes sir, especially since my son Sam would want to see that as well,"" O'Shaughnessy replied. ——— Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2018-12-23 08:46:17,Santa tracker will still run despite government shutdown,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century: Paradise, California. Deadliest attack on Jews in American history: Pittsburgh. The cities of Parkland, Paradise and Pittsburgh became synonymous with tragedy in 2018, a year when the nation seemed to careen from one deadly horror to another. Yet in every calamity, there were people who showed their humanity, their selfless strength and their sense of duty amid the suffering. As the year draws to a close, Associated Press reporters on the front lines of some of the year's heartbreaking stories offer up accounts of compassion and decency. 'I CHOSE TO ACT' Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said no class in any seminary could have prepared anyone for the role he was thrust into. Myers was leading Shabbat services when gunfire erupted inside his Pittsburgh synagogue on Oct. 27. After helping others to safety, Myers turned back and raced up the stairs to a choir loft, where he called 911. Seven members of his Tree of Life congregation and four others in the building were killed. As the Jewish community grieved, Myers took a leading role during public memorials and presided over seven funerals in the space of less than a week. ""I really had two choices when it came down to how to respond,"" Myers said. ""One of them was ... curl up with a bottle of scotch. The second choice was to act upon it. I chose to act upon it."" His response inspired Tree of Life congregants, including retired psychiatrist Joe Charny, 90. ""There's no question that he's been super, and it's hard to imagine that anybody could have done a better job,"" Charny said. ""He has the right touch. He has maintained through all this a sense of humor. I don't know how he's done that."" Myers has vowed to no longer use the word ""hate."" ""To me, that's the mission that has come out of this, that for 11 beautiful people to have not died in vain,"" the rabbi said. ""The conversation about hate speech in America must be elevated and it must gain attention, because that type of speech leads to action such as what happened at my synagogue."" — AP writer Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania A MORBID BUT CRITICAL TASK It was the week before Thanksgiving when Craig Covey got the call for what would be his most difficult mission as a search-and-rescue team leader: picking through the ashes of Paradise for human remains. It was a morbid but critical task. A wildfire that swept through on Nov. 8 all but obliterated Paradise, once home to 27,000 people. To find and identify the 86 dead, authorities had to call on searchers like Covey to gather up what amounted in some cases to little more than teeth, bone fragments or artificial hips. Then they had to rely on the expertise of rapid-testing DNA labs, forensic anthropologists and other specialists. ""It was apocalyptic up there,"" Covey said several weeks after returning home to Costa Mesa, California. Covey's team is deployed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to disasters across the country and beyond. Earlier this year, his team helped rescue an exhausted 82-year-old man who had been flushed out of his car by floodwaters and pinned in some trees amid Hurricane Florence in North Carolina. Paradise was different, but brought rewards of its own. ""We weren't shaking hands with people,"" Covey said. ""But we were making a difference for folks, for closure, who are missing their families."" — AP writer Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California DOGS IN TUNE WITH HUMANS When classes resumed in late February following the massacre of 17 students and staff at Parkland's Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School, a therapy dog by the name of Fergie was brought in. Fergie, an 8-year-old cross between a golden retriever and a poodle, zeroed in on one young man and sat on his feet the entire class, barely moving, said Aneysi Fernandez, volunteer coordinator of the nonprofit group Canine Assisted Therapy. ""It turned out that was one of the students who lost most of his friends in the shooting,"" said Fernandez. ""Some of our dogs like Fergie are very in tune with human emotions."" Several therapy animal groups helped out in those dark days after the Feb. 14 mass shooting. The dogs — and in some cases, donkeys and horses — went into the cafeteria and classrooms. They were also at vigils and marches. Fernandez's organization sent 35 therapy dogs and their handlers into the school. All of the animals were trained and selected for their calm, happy demeanor. Some Parkland students specifically asked for a dog to shadow them during classes, saying that the animals' presence eased the stress of returning to a place where such a horrible thing happened. ""It's nice not to be asked any questions, to not have to relive the event,"" Fernandez said. ""Everyone grieves differently. Students who didn't want to talk could pet a dog."" Ten months after the tragedy, a dozen dogs still show up at the school every day, mostly to sit by the side of those teens who need a calming presence. — AP writer Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida 'IT'S IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD' It was known as the Wall of Forgotten Natives, a sprawling homeless encampment that sprouted along a Minneapolis freeway sound barrier over the summer. Most of those living there were American Indians, who make up an outsized portion of the homeless population in the city, and the tents stood on what was once Dakota land. University of Minnesota medical and law student Kristina Tester grew up nearby and began helping at the camp as part of an elective rotation for her degree. She began doing clean-needle exchanges and continued on as a volunteer for months after her assignment ended. ""There's really not much of a difference between myself and any of the residents who are here at the homeless camp, other than sort of luck of the draw and geographic-political lottery,"" she said. The 26-year-old Tester said she organized groups of university students to do laundry for camp residents. She also served meals about once a week with neighbors. Recently she delivered cookies and blankets made by high school students. Tester, who is non-Indian, said she did it because ""it's in my neighborhood."" At its peak, the encampment had 300 people, but they began moving into a temporary shelter across the highway as winter approached. Maggie Thunder Hawk, 56, an Oglala Lakota from Wanblee, South Dakota, picked up two blankets that Tester delivered. ""If it wasn't for her, we'd be cold, because she brings us warm blankets,"" Thunder Hawk said. ""I love her."" — AP writer Jeff Baenen in Minneapolis ——— AP writer Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco contributed to this story. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2018-12-24 12:00:31,Amid 2018's tragedies were moments of compassion and duty,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
368,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/toughest-year-us-immigration-dominated-2018-59949780,"Under Trump, a relentless stream of US policy shifts made 2018 a tumultuous year for immigration enforcement NEW YORK -- Children torn from their parents, refugees turned away, tear gas fired on asylum-seekers, and a president who says he's willing to shut down the government to make good on his promise for a border wall. In a breathless 2018, they were just a handful of headlines on immigration, one of the year's most dominant issues. Combined with a relentless stream of administrative memos and changes in regulation and enforcement, it represented a government bombardment on virtually every type of         immigration — a bold follow-up to the opening salvo of President Donald Trump's first year in office. For those who champion Trump and believe that cracking down on immigration translates to better lives for Americans, it has been a year of fulfillment of campaign promises. For those who've watched in horror, it harkened back to other points in the country's history, when fear of new arrivals led the U.S. to refuse entry to various groups and when open discrimination of certain ethnicities prevailed. ""This is our generation's sort of existential moment,"" said Frank Sharry, head of pro-immigration group America's Voice. ""Are we going to continue to be a nation that practices 'e pluribus unum' and welcomes people from around the world to make this country better? Or are we going to shut the door?"" Throughout 2018, the answer has largely been the latter. Even as roundups and deportations persist in targeting those who enter the U.S. illegally, the Trump administration has pushed beyond that to redefine what legal immigration looks like, too. It has slowed down or altogether halted many seeking to come to the country for a job offer or through their relationship to a citizen, and narrowed the chances of finding a home here as a refugee or asylum seeker. Jarring visuals of children in detention centers and other enforcement actions have dissuaded some from seeking to come here at all. ""There has been this constant chip, chip, chipping away at the legal immigration system using every tool of the executive branch,"" said Doug Rand, who worked in the Obama administration before helping found Boundless Immigration, which helps people navigate the immigration system. The year neared its close with the administration saying those seeking asylum would be forced to wait in Mexico, a major shift that immediately spurred questions of legality from opponents. Meantime, the possibility of a government shutdown loomed as Trump and Democrats once again butted heads over funding to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Even without it, though, the policies he's pursued have effectively put up a virtual wall. ""That is far more effective than a border wall ever would be,"" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Even top-tier computer programmers, architects, engineers and other professionals with job offers in the U.S. saw their applications for H1-B visas under much more scrutiny; a means of expediting processing of those visas was ended under Trump, and bids for work authorization have been met by what employers and immigration attorneys say seem like endless requests for evidence to prove seemingly straightforward facts. Still, the odds of those professionals eventually gaining clearance to enter the U.S. are better than for many others. Trump's so-called ""travel ban,"" the first iteration of which was unveiled in the president's first week in office, was         upheld in June by the U.S. Supreme Court, stopping most visas for residents of mostly Muslim Libya, Iran, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as well as North Korea and Venezuela. Though the policy allows for waivers, initial data showed few such applications were actually approved, effectively shutting the door to most from those nations. It's had very real consequences for people like Soolmaz Dadgari, an Iranian who came to the U.S. in 2017 so her 4-year-old daughter, Arina, could take part in an experimental study to treat a rare genetic disorder. Dadgari's husband has been unable to get a visa to join them, and sanctions make it hard for him to send money. She alone cares for a child who can't walk or talk and requires 24-hour help, as well as another 11-year-old daughter. Dadgari has considered returning home but knows she needs to remain for her daughter's treatment. Still, the situation has affected the way she views the U.S., which she had always regarded as the best place in the world. ""I have no hope,"" she said. Even as wars, persecution and famine have continued around the world, the U.S. capped refugee admissions at 45,000 for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the lowest ceiling since the State Department began tracking the figure in 1980. Far fewer were actually admitted in that time frame: about 21,000 refugees. The number is likely to fall further, with the         cap for the current fiscal year set at 30,000. Meantime, tens of thousands fleeing violence in Central America sought asylum in the U.S. this year. The Trump administration responded by narrowing who is eligible, declaring that neither those escaping gang violence or domestic abuse nor those who cross the border illegally qualify. Both changes have been blocked by federal courts. Some seeking refuge in the U.S. are stuck in untenable positions. Ivis Muñoz, 26, decided to join a caravan leaving Honduras in mid-October. A gang member had shot him in the thigh and threatened to kill him. Muñoz planned to seek asylum in the U.S. but learned along his journey that he was unlikely to be accepted. His first night in Tijuana, Mexico, he slept on the beach until rocks rained down on him and other migrants and a man shouted in the darkness: ""Go back to your country!"" Now he's a few hours east in Mexicali, his aching leg full of bullet fragments, overwhelmed and scared by his reality. ""I don't know what to do,"" said Munoz, a coffee farmer from the Honduran town of Atima. ""I want to go to the United States, though I'm scared they'll send me back. I'm afraid to be in Honduras, but I don't feel safe here either."" At every turn, there were policy changes. One proposed         rule would restrict visas or legal permanent residence for those receiving certain government benefits for low-income people, such as food stamps. Hundreds of immigrant enlistees in the Army were discharged or had their contracts cancelled, though some were later reinstated. Even some U.S. citizens were targeted by a ""denaturalization task force"" looking for naturalized Americans with past infractions. More than any other shifts in policy, the Trump administration's move to separate apprehended migrant children from their parents shook people around the world. Though Trump eventually ended widespread use of the practice, the scars remain for those affected. Evelin Roxana Meyer of La Union, Honduras, thought 2018 would be the year things turned around for her family. They've struggled to pay off a loan for the grocery store they run out of their home, so her husband, Douglas, and son, Eduardo, set off for the United States in hopes of finding work. Instead, the two were picked up by Border Patrol agents and separated. The father was deported, but it took weeks before the parents knew where Eduardo was taken. He spent four months in detention, turning 12 alone at a facility in Brownsville, Texas. The once-affectionate boy returned home angry in September. He rarely goes out, spending most of his time in his room watching TV. He's refused to go to school and will have to repeat the sixth grade. He talks back to his parents and hits his little sister, whom he used to be close to. The family doesn't know what to do to help him. ""This was the toughest year of all,"" said 38-year-old Meyer. Polling finds a big         majority of Americans still view the country's openness to immigrants as essential to the nation's identity. But the profound shift in government policies on the subject threatens that idea of the U.S. as a welcoming land of opportunity for all. Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University, sees Trump's immigration overhaul as the continuation of a tug-of-war that's played out since the nation's founding, between what many see as bedrock American ideals and a pattern of nevertheless being hostile to newcomers. ""The country, unfortunately, has had an incongruence with the myth of America versus the reality of America,"" said Greer, who authored ""Black Ethnics: Race, Immigration, and the Pursuit of the American Dream."" ''Trump's really fine with blowing up the myth."" Sharry thinks the country's reputation suffers when its leaders close the doors to others: ""They've put a million people on the road to deportation. They've ripped thousands of kids from their parents. They've gutted refugee protection at our border. They're building and expanding detention centers. They're trying to scare low-income immigrants from using health and other services. They've taken aim at legal immigration. They've slashed refugee admissions. That's a pretty relentless assault on a core principal of the American experiment."" Others see it far differently. Neil Gouveia came to the U.S. from Guyana as a 7-year-old. His family waited years to earn visas, then waited again to become citizens. His parents made the difficult choice to leave behind his 9-year-old sister, who had cerebral palsy and wasn't granted a visa. Gouveia considered himself a typical ""liberal New Yorker"" until 2016, when he was drawn to Trump for what he believed was his strength on national security. Gouveia is gay and said the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, particularly shook him. He wasn't offended when Trump referred to parts of the world as ""shithole countries,"" and doesn't see anything inherently wrong in separating immigrant children from the adults they arrive with. He thinks, ultimately, it will all lead to greater dialogue and better policies. And he still believes America stands as a beacon for much of the world. ""At the end of the day, people will say what they want to say about America, but there's hardly anyone who still wouldn't want to come here,"" said Gouveia, 39, a collegiate fundraiser. ""They still know it's like winning the lottery."" Daniel Stein heads the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports restrictive immigration measures. He agrees the year's immigration imagery has had ""a huge political impact on the psyche of the nation,"" but argues it has moved more people to his side of the debate. And to those who see the year as an extended assault on a cornerstone American value, he's unmoved. ""They have a vivid imagination,"" Stein said. ""We have one of the world's most generous immigration programs."" That's little comfort to Buena Ventura Martin Godinez, a 29-year-old mother of two who carried her 9-month-old son across the border in May, fleeing threats from violent gangsters in her hometown of San Juan Atitan, Guatemala. She was caught in Arizona and held for a week at a detention center with her baby. When her husband followed two weeks later with their 7-year-old daughter, they weren't so lucky. The girl was sent to a facility in Michigan and kept there for six weeks; the father went to an Atlanta jail, where he still awaits deportation. Her family fractured, Godinez now regrets the day she ever headed to the U.S. ""I came looking for a better life ... and everything went wrong,"" she said from the five-room house in Homestead, Florida, that she and her two children share with nine others. ""I thought that it was true that it is a country that gives opportunities. But it is not."" Godinez notices changes in her children. Her daughter, always so sweet and obedient, cries incessantly and struggles in school. Her son keeps falling ill, his temperament now trademarked by screaming, crying and sighing. ""This is the worst year I ever had,"" she said. ——— Watson reported from San Diego.

369,https://abcnews.go.com/US/2018-mass-shooting-month-us/story?id=59418185,"The list of deadly shootings continues to grow. Deadliest mass shootings of 2018 in the U.S. Some of the deadliest mass shootings in the U.S. last year -- including the Parkland high school shooting and the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh -- prompted widespread national horror. News of other mass shootings, however, seemed to have only reached local audiences. There were a number of incidents where spouses or former spouses killed their partners, and sometimes their children, in Texas, Delaware, Tennessee, Maryland and California. The FBI does not have an official definition of a mass shooting. They do, however, define a mass killing as an incident in which three or more people, not including the suspect, are killed. For decades, that definition used four or more deaths as the metric, but that changed in 2013. Various groups and watchdog organizations keep their own lists, often using different criteria for what qualifies as a mass shooting and often sticking with the earlier threshold of four or more deaths. The FBI defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, not including the suspect, are killed. While there is no publicly accessible federal tracker of such incidents, various groups and watchdog organizations keep their own lists, often using different criteria for what qualifies as a mass shooting. For the list compiled by ABC News below, the incidents took place over the course of a day and involved four or more victims, not including the suspect. For instance, shooting sprees that spanned longer amounts of time were not included on this list. All told, there were at least 20 shootings in 2018 that fit these parameters. There are hundreds of other deadly shootings that took place across the U.S. this year that don't fit these conditions, including some that received national attention, like the shooting at a Maryland Rite Aid, or the shooting at a Chicago hospital. In both of those incidents, three victims were killed and the suspects in each shooting also killed themselves. But whether they made national headlines or not, the common, heartbreaking thread among the 20 incidents below was that they all happened in 2018. 1. Jan. 28: Shooting at a Pennsylvania car wash, 4 victims Four people were killed in a shooting outside a self-service car wash in a rural western Pennsylvania town when a man wearing body armor and wielding three guns, including an AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifle, opened fire on them, according to Pennsylvania authorities. The shooting in Melcroft in Fayette County, about 55 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, occurred at 2:52 a.m. and was described by the local district attorney as a ""horrible and senseless event."" 2. Jan. 28: Shooting at an apartment in Pennsylvania, 4 victims The suspect in the shooting of four people at a Reading apartment complex is still at large, authorities said. ""We cannot remember any time in recent history when this many people were shot at one time,"" James Marasco Jr., the deputy chief of the Reading Police Department told the Associated Press at the time. Capt. Paul Reilly of the Reading Police Department's investigation division told ABC News that as of Nov. 26, there have been no arrests and it is still an open investigation. They do not believe it was a random shooting, Reilly said. 3. Feb. 10: Domestic shooting spree in Kentucky, 4 victims The suspect who killed his parents, his girlfriend and her mother allegedly struggled with drug addiction before the shooting, his pastor told The Lexington Herald Leader. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Joseph Nickell, killed himself after he killed his parents, James Wayne Nickell, 75, and Arlene Nickell, 70; his girlfriend Lindsey Vanhoose, 41; and her mother Patricia Vanhoose, 57. The shooter's teenage son was reportedly at his grandparents' home where the first shooting occurred and escaped before calling 911, the paper reported. 4. Feb. 14: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, 17 victims The deadliest shooting of the year took place in Parkland, Florida, when a former student opened fire and killed 17 students and school staffers. The suspect, Nikolas Cruz, fled the scene and was later apprehended by authorities. He has been charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the school shooting, and is now facing new charges after allegedly attacking a deputy in jail, according to ABC affiliate WPLG. The massacre prompted survivors to launch a national movement and Florida to change its gun laws. Held a month after the deadly shooting, the March for Our Lives became a national event and some of its student organizers -- including Emma Gonzalez, David Hogg and Jackie Corin --  have become widely recognized figures in the fight for gun reform. The group also launched a national bus tour to try to get other young people involved. 5. Feb. 26: Shootings at gas station and a home in Detroit, 4 victims A man pulled up to a car at a Detroit gas station and opened fire on his child's mother, Ciera Bargaineer, after an altercation. The suspect, George Davis Jr., killed Bargaineer, another woman who was in the car with her, 21-year old Kristin Thomas, and Bargaineer's father, 60-year-old Raphael Hall, ABC affiliate WXYZ reported. Davis then reportedly fled the scene and fatally shot his cousin at a home about two miles away, according to WXYZ. Davis shot himself after leading police on a chace, the station reported. 6. April 22: Waffle House shooting in Nashville, 4 victims A bystander a deadly massacre at a Waffle House. James Shaw Jr., 29, confronted the gunman, took his gun, threw it over a counter and forced the gunman outside. The suspect, Travis Reinking, who was later apprehended by law enforcement officers and is now facing four counts of criminal homicide. Four people were killed: Taurean Sanderlin, 29, a cook at the restaurant who was on a cigarette break and was one of the first slain in the shooting; DeEbony Groves, 21, an honor student at Belmont University in Nashville; and Akilah DaSilva, 23, a Middle Tennessee State University student. The youngest victim was 20-year-old Joe Perez, whose mother wrote in a Facebook post, ""Me, my husband and sons are broken right now with this loss. Our lives are shattered."" 7. May 17: Domestic violence incident in Texas, 4 victims A woman, identified in her children's subsequent obituary as Amanda Simpson Painter, survived a shooting where she says her ex-husband Justin Painter killed their three children and her then-boyfriend, according to The Dallas Morning News. The victims were identified as 29-year-old Seth Richardson, and Odin, 8, Caydence, 6, and Drake Painter, 4. Amanda Simpson Painter told The Huffington Post that Justin Painter told her that he was intentionally letting her alive to live with the pain of losing her children. 8. May 18: Santa Fe High School shooting, 10 victims Gov. Greg Abbott called the shooting, where 10 people were killed and 13 others injured, ""one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools."" The suspect, 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is in custody and has been charged with capital murder, officials said. The suspect allegedly wrote in journals that he wanted to carry out the shooting and then commit suicide, but he gave himself up to authorities, according to Abbott. 9. June 10: Domestic violence incident in Florida, 4 victims Four young children were fatally shot by their mother's boyfriend and the suspect shot an officer in the head after police responded to the scene. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said the suspect, Gary Lindsey Jr., was the father of two of the children -- Dove Lindsey, 1, and Aiden Lindsey, 6. He allegedly killed them along with the other two children in the home -- Lillia Pluth, 10, and Irayan Pluth, 12 -- in the altercation. Lindsey then killed himself at the scene. Orlando Police Department officer Kevin Valencia was shot in the head and remains in a coma more than five months after the incident, according to a spokesperson for the department. 10. June 28: Shooting at Maryland newspaper office, 5 victims The shooting at a Maryland newsroom that killed five people was a targeted attack, according to local police. The suspect, armed with a shotgun, looked for victims in the newsroom of the Capital Gazette, a daily newspaper in Annapolis, which is located in the first floor of a multi-office building, Anne Arundel Police Department Deputy Chief Bill Krampf said at the time. Rob Hiaasen, 59, Wendi Winters, 65, Gerald Fischman, 61, John McNamara, 56, and Rebecca Smith, 34, all were shot to death, allegedly by 38-year-old Jarrod Ramos, who had a longstanding feud with the newspaper and has been charged with five counts of first-degree murder. 11. July 9: Domestic violence incident in Delaware, 4 victims A man in Wilmington shot his wife and three children before shooting himself, the Delaware State Police reported.

NBC Washington reported that the suspect, Yong Mun Kim, left names and phone numbers of relatives for police, which suggests he planned the murder-suicide. 15. Oct. 13: Shooting at a birthday party in Texas, 4 victims A toddler's first birthday party turned deadly following an alleged altercation between two families attending the party.

Oct. 27: Shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, 11 victims Eleven worshipers, including a 97-year-old woman, were gunned down inside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in America. ""Words escape me of what you can say,"" said Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was officiating a service when a gunman started shooting. ""They were all beautiful, wonderful, good decent people. Hate was not in their vocabulary."" 18. Nov. 7: Shooting at a California bar, 12 victims At least 12 people, including a police officer, were killed when a gunman opened fire in a packed Southern California bar during its ""college night,"" leaving the community of Thousand Oaks in shock and in mourning.

Authorities believe he shot himself. 19. Nov. 19: Drug-related shooting in Philadelphia, 4 victims Four people were killed in what was described by the Associated Press as a drug sale gone awry in Philadelphia. The victims were identified as William Taylor and Akeen Mattox, along with sisters Tiyaniah Rakele Hopkins and Yaleah Hall. ""At a minimum, three people were collateral damage in a horrific incident,"" police commissioner Richard Ross said, according to the AP. Philadelphia police confirmed that the four suspects -- Jahlil Porter, Robert Long, Nasir Moss Robertson, and Keith Garner -- are facing murder, robbery, and criminal conspiracy charges among others. 20. Dec. 28: Boyfriend kills girlfriend, her kids, and her mother in Missouri, 4 victims The suspect, Richard Darren Emery, was arrested on suspicion of killing his live-in girlfriend, Kate Kasten, her son Jonathan Kasten, 10, her daughter Zoe Kasten, 8, and her mother Jane Moeckel. Emery lived with Kate Kasten and her two children, whose father Kory died about two years ago after a years-long battle with cancer. Jane Moeckel -- Kate Kasten’s mother -- was staying with Emery and Kasten temporarily as she recovered from knee surgery, according to Kasten's father and Moeckel's ex-husband Rick Moeckel, who spoke to ABC News. “The whole thing is confusing,” said Rick Moeckel, who also lost two grandchildren. He added that he remembered Emergy as a ""nice guy."" Emery was arrested after avoiding police for several hours -- attempting to steal a woman’s car and attacking her -- before being apprehended at a convenience store. He now faces 15 charges -- including four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of armed criminal action, three counts of first-degree assault, and one count of attempted robbery.

370,https://abcnews.go.com/US/anatomy-las-vegas-mass-shooting-deadliest-modern-us/story?id=59797324,"ABC News' ""Nightline"" takes a comprehensive look at Las Vegas mass shooting. A Killer on Floor 32 Rosemarie Melanson remembers staring down at the chaos breaking out at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, seeing her limp body splayed on the ground, blood coming from a bullet wound to her chest. She recalls floating in the sky away from frantic screams and the rain of gunfire that instantly obliterated what had been an awesome autumn night on the town with her two daughters. ""The next thing I know I was in heaven,"" Melanson told ABC News' ""Nightline."" ""And I saw my dad and my two brothers, and my uncle. And it was so beautiful. It was so beautiful you didn't want to come back. They just told me, 'It's not your time, Rosemarie. You've got to go back.'"" Watch the full documentary ""A Killer on Floor 32"" on Hulu right now. ABC News' ""Nightline"" is set to air one of the most comprehensive examinations of a U.S. mass shooting ever compiled, a look back at the Oct. 1, 2017, Las Vegas massacre that killed 58 people and left Melanson and more than 850 others wounded at a country music concert. Stephen Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay on Sept. 25, 2017, arriving just before 3 p.m. after making the normally 70-minute drive in his new Hyundai Tucson SUV from his home in Mesquite, Nevada, about 74 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The 64-year-old former accountant and realtor who had once amassed a $2.1 million fortune was a regular at the hotel and considered a high roller designated for VIP treatment. ""He was a very typical guest,"" said Steven Martinez, senior vice president of global security for MGM Resorts, which owns the Mandalay Bay. ""He was, in our estimation, the lowest risk type individual that would come onto our property."" Paddock was given top-shelf service, allowing him to ride up a service elevator to his room with his luggage and accompanied by a bellhop. During his stay at the Mandalay Bay, he made several trips to his home, returning each time with more bags. In all, he brought in 21 suitcases, authorities said. He was checked into suite 32-135 on the 32nd floor, a 1,700-square-foot corner space featuring floor-to-ceiling windows offering a wraparound view overlooking the famed Las Vegas Strip. He later reserved an adjoining suite, 32-134, using the name of his girlfriend, authorities said. A plethora of security cameras at the resort practically recorded Paddock's every move outside his hotel suite. Surveillance footage showed him walking through the hotel's marbled-floor lobby, making a purchase in the gift shop, riding the elevators, sitting at slot machines and video poker machines. ""Everything he did is what you'd expect a normal guest to do: Using food and beverage, restaurants, having things delivered to his room,"" Martinez said. ""He preferred to play video poker machines. He'd stay at that for hours on end."" Deputy Chief Andrew Walsh of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told ""Nightline"" that Paddock did nothing to stand out. He was just one man in a sea of thousands of hotel guests. ""He just looks like a middle-aged guy with a lot of luggage goin' up to his room,"" Walsh said. On Oct. 1, 2017, Paddock ordered room service and records show that between 2:23 p.m. and 9:40 p.m. he opened and closed the doors to both suites several times. Jason Aldean, the country music star whose first eight albums have scored gold or platinum sales figures, had taken the stage around 9:40 that night. The former truck driver was now the closing act of the three-day Route 91 Harvest Festival at an open-air venue across the Las Vegas Strip from the Mandalay Bay, and many in the crowd of 22,000 were singing along to his hit ""When She Says Baby."" Some days it's tough just gettin' up. Throwin' on these boots and makin' that climb, the song goes. But before Aldean could finish the first verse, he was interrupted by something that sounded at first like firecrackers. Within seconds, the noises grew rapid and soon everyone, including Aldean, recognized the staccato of gunfire. The time was 10:05 p.m. ""Somebody's shooting!"" a concertgoer yelled. ""Oh my God, I'm so ... scared."" People began to duck and cover. Others dove atop loved ones and petrified strangers, using their bodies as human shields. In less than a minute, more than 100 rounds rained down on the crowd. ""People went in multiple directions, but not knowing where the rounds were coming from,"" said Walsh, the captain in command of the downtown Las Vegas division the night the rampage was perpetrated on his turf. Jesus Campos, a security guard at the Mandalay Bay, was poised to wrap up his shift when he received a call to check out a room alarm on the 32nd floor. ""This was the last call of my night,"" he said. ""In my head, I was home free after this."" Campos was doing his rounds when he received the call to investigate the alarm one floor above him. He decided to take the stairwell to the 32nd floor. There he discovered something unusual: A metal L-bracket had been screwed to the door and doorjamb preventing him from opening it. He said he walked up to the 33rd floor and took the elevator back down. ""I didn't know what was going on just simply because that's not normal,"" he said of finding the L-bracket. ""I had to call our security dispatch."" His call, he said, was transferred to maintenance engineering. When he entered the 32nd-floor hallway, Campos, who was unarmed, heard what sounded like a drill coming from behind the doors at the far end of the hall inside suite 32-135. As he stepped in the direction of the strange noise, gunfire erupted. Someone barricaded in the high-roller suite somehow saw him coming and opened fire through the door. ""I was struck and I went to get cover,"" Campos said. ""I had to take a moment to realize what was going on. I went to lift up my pant leg and I saw the blood coming down."" Finding cover in an alcove, Campos radioed for help at 10:06 p.m. ""Hey, there's shots fired in 32-135,"" he reported. The original alarm call turned out to be a nanny who had left her room door ajar. Had that not occurred, Campos would not have stumbled upon the massacre at the precise moment it was commencing. He inadvertently became a hero by pinpointing the exact location of the shooter. At 10:08 p.m., Stephen Schuck, a Mandalay Bay maintenance engineer, got off an elevator on the 32nd floor. He had been relayed Campos' report that an L-bracket was blocking an exit door and went to check it out. ""I had no idea what was going on at the time,"" Schuck told ""Nightline."" When he exited the elevator, Schuck heard what sounded like a ""jackhammer."" ""I noticed him,"" Campos said of Schuck. ""I said, 'Get cover. It's not safe.' At that moment in time, there were more rounds being dispersed."" Schuck dove for cover as bullets whizzed down the hallway toward him. He said he radioed for help. ""I thought if I don't come out of the hallway alive, I wanted to communicate for Metro [police] and first responders to get up there because this is where the shooter is,"" Schuck said. Panicked concertgoers flooded the 911 dispatch center with calls. ""There are numerous reports coming in. We have 33 calls holding,"" a 911 dispatcher said over an emergency channel, according to a recording of radio transmissions. ""It's an active shooter."" After being temporarily distracted by Campos and then Schuck, the gunman in suite 32-135 returned to his perch in the frame of a shattered window of the suite and let loose another barrage of gunfire on the concertgoers below. Officer Brady Cook of the Metropolitan Police Department was one of the first officers to arrive on the scene. Video from another officer's bodycam caught the moments Cook and his colleagues came under fire and took cover behind their vehicles. ""I'm down! I got shot!"" Cook is heard on another officer's bodycam screaming. The 911 dispatchers were receiving unconfirmed reports of shooters in multiple hotels, including the Tropicana Las Vegas Casino Hotel Resort, one of the oldest hotels in the city, where scenes from ""The Godfather"" and Elvis Presley's ""Viva Las Vegas"" were filmed. ""What sticks with me is that fear, that pain in my stomach that this was going to just be the first part of a multifaceted attack,"" Walsh said. In the confusion, armed security guards at the Mandalay Bay initially thought the gunfire was coming from outside and exited the hotel in search of the shooter. Meanwhile, the victims remained sitting ducks as the ground around them thudded with bullets. Rosemarie Melanson had attended the concert with her adult daughters, Stephanie and Paige, the co-founders of a dance studio who had given their mom a ticket to the music festival as a Mother's Day present. The sisters were faced with a daunting decision: Stay with their gravely wounded mother and possibly die, or run for their lives. ""A retired firefighter came over and he told us we had to go,"" said Paige Melanson, who was wounded in the arm. ""He said that if we wanted to live that we needed to go. I looked into his eyes and he said, 'You need to go.' So I did."" Officer Richard Cole and his rookie trainee Officer Brandon Engstrom, on only his second day on the job, had just reported for duty. ""It was our sergeant who had the radio on. Shots came out over the radio,"" Engstrom told ""Nightline."" ""So immediately he yells at us to go to our cars, get ready and go to the concert venue."" As Engstrom and Cole raced to the scene, a colleague radioed a foreboding warning: ""Be aware, it is automatic fire, fully automatic fire from an elevated position. Take cover."" Every time an officer keyed a radio mic, the sound of rapid gunfire could be heard, the officers said. As soon as Engstrom and Cole arrived at the scene, a man rushed up to them holding his wounded wife. ""He came over to our car and he's carrying his wife, Jovanna, in his arms and he says, 'Help me, I'm a police officer,'"" Cole said. Frank Calzadillas, an officer for the Salt River Police Department in Arizona, had traveled to Vegas with his wife, Jovanna, to attend the concert. During the massacre, Jovanna was shot in the head and Cole and Engstrom clearly understood she wouldn't survive unless they got her to a hospital immediately. The officers put the couple in the back seat of their patrol vehicle and sped to University Medical Center in Las Vegas. Frank Calzadillas was doing chest compressions on his wife, pleading with her to stay alive. Cole said that as they raced to the hospital, they heard of Cook, who was also on his second day of work, being shot. ""I remember within the first 30 seconds to a minute of us driving to the hospital, we heard that an officer had been shot and Brandon [Engstrom] realized that was somebody he went to the academy with,"" he said. ""And I remember him saying, 'My buddy just got shot.'"" Police bodycam video showed the officers pulling up to the crowded emergency room and carrying Jovanna Calzadillas inside, asking doctors and nurses, ""Where do you want her?"" ""At that point ... she was bleeding everywhere, like her entire body was covered in blood,"" Cole said. After laying the wounded woman on a gurney, Cole and Engstrom decided what to do next. ""I'm washing my hands and I said something to the effect, 'It's an effing terrorist attack. Just get everybody here.' I then ... looked at Brandon and he said, 'What are we doing?'"" Cole recalled. ""I said, 'Let's go. We've got to go back.'"" Once authorities were aware of the shooter's location at the Mandalay Bay, police conducted a full sweep of the hotel. ""Show me your hands! Show me your hands!"" one officer was heard in bodycam footage yelling as he and his well-armed team fanned out in the casino, clearing gamblers from row after row of flashing and ringing slot machines. Police SWAT teams were going floor to floor in the gilded 43-story tower, bursting into rooms with guns drawn and rousting guests. ""There is an active shooter in the hotel, OK. Stay locked in your room. Thank you,"" an officer is heard in a bodycam video telling a startled guest still in bed. When SWAT teams made it to the 32nd floor, they were confronted by an eerie silence and a room-service cart parked outside of suite 32-134 with wires coming out of it. ""What is that cart that's in the hallway?"" one of the officers asked. Another officer replied, ""I don't know. That's why you're not going any farther."" ""They get close enough to that room, there's wires, there's cameras. What are they walking into? Is that an IED? Is there more than one person? How many people are there? We had nothing,"" said Deputy Chief Walsh. On closer inspection, the officers saw the room-service cart was rigged with a small surveillance camera hidden under a plate and pointed down the hallway at them. They dismantled the overhead lights to give them cover and placed a bomb strip to the door of the suite. ""Stand by for breach!"" one of them yelled, prompting others to cover their ears. ""Breach! Breach! Breach!"" the orders came followed by an explosion. When they entered the room, they found Paddock dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The suite was littered with more than 1,000 spent gun shell casings and an arsenal of weapons, some lying on the beds and on the floor, others stacked in a bathtub. A small surveillance camera had been fitted over the peephole of the suite's entrance door. The officers blasted open the door to the adjoining suite, the one Paddock had booked under his girlfriend's name days earlier, and found more weapons there. In total, police seized 24 guns, including AR-15 and AR-10 assault rifles with armor-piercing bullets. Some of the weapons had been altered with bump-stocks, devices to make them simulate machine guns. Police also found over 5,000 unused rounds of ammunition. As word spread through the hotel that the gunman was dead, one officer addressed a crowd of hotel guests sheltering in place. ""We have no control over the actions of evil people, but we're here now,"" the officer said. The room broke into loud applause. Since the shooting, the Mandalay Bay has instituted new security measures, including using K-9 units to conduct random checks of luggage, Martinez said. Deputy Chief Walsh said the hotel has also boosted its scrutiny of guests, including evaluating who can check into rooms overlooking outdoor venues both on the Las Vegas Strip and downtown. ""They've been great partners for us,"" he said of the casino industry. But not everyone agrees. Mandalay Bay and MGM officials have argued in court filings that the mass shooting was clearly an act of terrorism and because of that, they should not be held legally responsible. The company has even taken the controversial step of suing more than 1,000 victims of the attack to escape financial liability. Citing a law passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the company argues it is not financially responsible because the security company it hired for the concert was federally certified against terrorist attacks. Responding to a backlash from the lawsuit, MGM lawyers contend it is simply a legal maneuver and not meant to insult those injured or killed. ""This is a small city and it's a big family,"" Bowling told ""Nightline."" ""The community depends on Mandalay Bay. We're a community serving a community. And so, this is our focus: We can mourn what's going on, but we can work together to look to the future, and that there's hope."" The lawsuit is currently suspended while MGM and the survivors attempt to resolve their differences in mediation. Asked how Paddock could sneak that many weapons into the hotel, Chuck Bowling, president and chief operating officer for the Mandalay Bay, said he was treated as any other guest. ""My first response to that is there are thousands of people walking through the front door, our back door, from the parking garage with luggage. We greet and welcome them. That's our first responsibility,"" Bowling told ""Nightline."" ""Once I saw the arsenal that was up there ... it's sickening,"" he said. More than a year since the mass murder, investigators, survivors and the families of those slaughtered are left with one gnawing question above all others: What possessed a middle-aged retired accountant to commit the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history? ""Other places that have had mass casualty incidents ... the shooters ... have left behind manifestos. In this case, we just don't have that,"" Deputy Chief Walsh said. The bullet that hit Rosemarie Melanson in the upper right chest, traveled sideways through her body, severing her esophagus, breaking several ribs, and tearing through her intestine, her liver and spleen. After 12 surgeries and months spent in and out of the hospital, she was finally sent home to recover six days before the one-year anniversary of the attack. ""I'm stronger than I thought I was,"" she said. The U.S. Justice Department has allocated $17 million to assist those affected by the shooting. Stephen Schuck, the Mandalay Bay maintenance engineer, said the shooting left him with a new appreciation for life. ""I feel like I got a second chance that 58 people didn't, and I need to live a good life to honor them,"" Schuck said. On the morning after the mass shooting, officers Cole and Engstrom returned to University Medical Center to check on Officer Brady Cook and Jovanna Calzadillas, the critically wounded Arizona woman they drove to the hospital and whose blood stained their shirts. ""I thought for sure that she probably didn't make it,"" said Cole. A nurse, however, directed them to the intensive care unit, where the woman was being treated. Calzadillas survived and is still undergoing rehabilitation today. ""They saved my life,"" Jovanna Calzadillas told ""Nightline"" of Cole and Engstrom. Her husband, Frank, added: ""There aren't any words to say how grateful we are for them or how much we appreciate everything they did. We just know there's nothing but love for those two guys."" Engstrom, now more than a year on the job, said hearing of Jovanna's survival was the most heartening news he and Cole received on what will likely be the most horrific day in both their law enforcement careers. ""Going to the hospital and learning that she's actually still alive,"" Engstrom said, ""was kind of like sunshine to a dark day."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2018-12-18 09:00:05, Anatomy of the mass shooting in Las Vegas: Killer in the luxury suite,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
371,https://abcnews.go.com/US/start-here-short-term-spending-proposal-michael-flynns-sentencing/story?id=59890980,"There's talk of a deal to avoid a partial government shutdown -- for now. GOP offers $1.6B in new spending for border security, not wall It's Wednesday, Dec. 19, 2018. Thanks for choosing to start here. 1. White House floats alternative funding options as shutdown looms Earlier this week, all signs pointed to a government shutdown after Democrats said they were prepared to make a deal including $1.6 billion for border security -- but zero for a border wall. President Donald Trump said if they didn't raise that number, he was happy to shut down the government. ABC News Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran says momentum appeared to be building yesterday around a plan that would kick the can down the road -- a short-term spending bill to maintain the status quo. 2. Michael Flynn's sentencing delayed Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, was supposed to be sentenced on Tuesday for lying to the FBI, but his hearing took a dramatic turn after the judge expressed ""disgust"" over Flynn's conduct. Flynn's legal team suggested the FBI hadn't warned him that lying to federal agents is a felony, but Flynn admitted in court that he knew he was committing a crime. Judge Emmet Sullivan blasted Flynn for lying to investigators about his contact with the Russian ambassador. ""I'm not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense,"" Sullivan said. Flynn's attorney requested that the hearing be postponed. The judge agreed, and set a status update for March. ABC News' James Gordon Meek and Katherine Faulders both were in the courtroom and noted a ""dramatic shift"" in Flynn during the hearing. ""He walked into court,"" Meek tells us, ""thinking that this was going to be the start of his next chapter of his life ... and that's not what happened. It clearly was a blow, and he was stung by it, as were the people who were with him."" 3. Bump stocks finally banned ... almost The Trump administration on Tuesday moved to ban bump stocks, which effectively turn semi-automatic firearms into machine guns, after they were used in the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Gun owners will have until late March to destroy or forfeit the devices, which make it possible for certain guns to fire 800 rounds per minute. At an Oct. 1, 2017, press conference, after 58 people were slaughtered at a concert in Las Vegas, Trump said he believed it would only take ""two or three weeks"" to ban bump stocks. Yesterday's announcement came 443 days after that. 4.

373,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-issues-rule-banning-bump-stocks-year/story?id=59884493,"The rule comes more than a year the Las Vegas gunman used bump stocks. Trump administration issues rule banning bump stocks On Tuesday, 443 days since the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history was carried out at a Las Vegas music festival with the use of rifles equipped with ""bump stock"" devices that allowed the weapons to essentially operate as an automatic weapon, the Trump administration made good on President Donald Trump’s promise to ban the devices. The Justice Department has issued a final rule banning bump stocks, amending current regulations surrounding the devices and making clear that guns with ""bump stock devices"" are effectively machine guns. ""The president is once given fulfilling a promise to the American people and this morning the acting attorney general signed the final rule making clear that bump stocks are illegal because they fall within the definition of machine guns banned under federal firearms law,"" press secretary Sarah Sanders said at her briefing Tuesday. ""A 90-day period now begins which persons in possession of bump-stock type devices must return them to an ATF office or destroy them. Instructions will be posted on the website today."" A senior Justice Department official told reporters there are currently ""tens of thousands"" of bump stocks in the U.S., but the official said it's hard to know a specific number. The official said that those who currently possess bump stocks can either turn it into ATF or destroy them. The announcement of the rule comes after an extended delay in Trump's promise to ban the devices. At an Oct. 1 presser, Trump said he believed it would only be ""two or three weeks"" before it was all done. Within hours of issuing the new bump stock rule, gun rights activists filed suit in federal court to stop the government from enforcing the rule. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in D.C., contains more than 1,000 pages of exhibits, including the preliminary investigative report from the Las Vegas shooting. No immediate action has been taken on the plaintiff’s proposed preliminary injunction. In the past, the president has claimed he already banned the devices with a simple stroke of a pen, and has used it as a wedge in his defense of the administration’s overall inaction in the wake of mass shootings. ""We got rid of the bump stocks,” Trump said in March to a crowd in Ohio. “The bump stocks, now, are under very strict control, which -- I think everybody agrees it's fine. And we really did a job -- nobody reported it -- doesn't get reported."" Trump also has also sought to hold up the issue as proof of his willingness to stand up to the National Rifle Association. The NRA in October 2017 released a statement that it supported a ""review"" by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives of whether bump stocks “comply with federal law.” The organization issued a statement Tuesday saying it was disappointed with the new rule. ""We are disappointed that this final rule fails to address the thousands of law-abiding Americans who relied on prior ATF determinations when lawfully acquiring these devices,"" Jennifer Baker, NRA spokesperson, said in the statement. ""As we recommended to ATF in our comments on the proposed rule, Congress made it possible for the Attorney General to provide amnesty for firearms regulated under the National Firearms Act. The Attorney General should have exercised that authority to provide a period of amnesty under this rule."" Previously, the ATF had ruled bump stocks complied with the law because they didn’t physically alter the mechanics of a firearm. As the agency initiated its review of the rule following the Vegas massacre, the acting ATF director at the time, Thomas Brandon, told lawmakers that he had been advised by attorneys any rule banning bump stocks could initiate a series of court challenges, and said a bill passed by Congress instead would be the preferable option. On Nov. 8, OMB finished their review of the rule and an official told ABC News at the time it was sent it back to DOJ. But it took weeks to finalize its publishing in the Federal Register. ABC News' Mike Levine and Jack Date contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2018-12-18 13:59:28, Trump administration issues final rule banning bump stocks,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

By MARC CAPUTO, MATT DIXON and ISABEL DOBRIN 11/29/2018 06:55 AM EST Good Thursday morning. Remember when we mentioned that Labor Secretary Alex Acosta might be under consideration to be President Donald Trump's attorney general? That chatter is probably over now that The Miami Herald printed a new blockbuster series on how Acosta, as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, gave a sweetheart deal to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a Palm Beach millionaire who may have victimized as many as 80 teens. That’s right: 80. Many elements of the story have been told over the years in bits and pieces by various outlets, but never so thoroughly in one place with so many damning facts and interviews. What’s the reaction to this among Trump supporters who believed in the Pizzagate and QAnon pedophile conspiracy theories? ACOSTA WON’T COMMENT — “How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime,” by Miami Herald's Julie K. Brown: “Not only would Epstein serve just 13 months in the county jail, but the deal — called a non-prosecution agreement — essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein’s sex crimes, according to a Miami Herald examination of thousands of emails, court documents and FBI records. The pact required Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution charges in state court. Epstein and four of his accomplices named in the agreement received immunity from all federal criminal charges. But even more unusual, the deal included wording that granted immunity to ‘any potential co-conspirators’ who were also involved in Epstein’s crimes. These accomplices or participants were not identified in the agreement, leaving it open to interpretation whether it possibly referred to other influential people who were having sex with underage girls at Epstein’s various homes or on his plane.” Read more — “Cops worked to put serial sex abuser in prison. Prosecutors worked to cut him a break,” by Miami Herald’s Julie K. Brown: Read more — “Even from jail, sex abuser manipulated the system. His victims were kept in the dark,” by Miami Herald's Julie K. Brown: Read more — “Trump’s Labor Secretary Once Helped a Billionaire Child Rapist Hide His Crimes,” by New York Magazine’s Eric Levitz: Read more MORE BAD NEWS — “Trump administration climate change report has plenty of bad news for Florida, experts say,” by Florida Today’s Tyler Treadway: “Climate change is real, it’s here already and it could impact Florida worse than any other state in the country. That’s the message a panel of experts assembled Wednesday by the nonprofit ReThink Energy Florida took away from the Fourth National Climate Assessment released Friday by the Trump administration.” Read more — “Fact-checking the White House push back on climate assessment,” by CNN’s Ellie Kaufman and Brandon Miller: Read more — “Climate change report could pose court problems for Trump's deregulation agenda,” by Yahoo’s Michael Walsh: Read more DOA — ""Democrats and Republicans want to tax pollution — and give the money back to you,"" by Bradenton Herald's Alex Daugherty: Read more EXIT INTERVIEW — “GOP Rep. Curbelo ‘Laughed’ at ‘Detached’ Trump for Mocking Him Over Midterm Loss,” by IJR’s William Steakin: “The day after the 2018 midterm elections, President Donald Trump ripped a number of Republicans who lost their respective races at a fiery White House press conference. ‘They did very poorly,’ the president said regarding candidates who ‘didn’t want the embrace’ of his support. Now with the midterms in the rearview mirror, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), one of the fallen Republican candidates whom Trump called out, tells IJR that he simply ‘laughed’ at the president’s antics, adding that it proved Trump makes “everything about him’ in an effort to ‘exploit our losses to project his strength.’” Read more OH? — “U.S. Unauthorized Immigrant Total Dips to Lowest Level in a Decade,” by Pew Research Center’s Jeffrey S. Passel and D’Vera Cohn: “The number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. fell to its lowest level in more than a decade, according to new Pew Research Center estimates based on 2016 government data. The decline is due almost entirely to a sharp decrease in the number of Mexicans entering the country without authorization. But the Mexican border remains a pathway for entry by growing numbers of unauthorized immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.” Read more AS EXPECTED — “Stephanie Murphy, Darren Soto and 'Problem Solvers' reach agreement with Nancy Pelosi,” by Orlando Sentinel's Steven Lemongello: Read more ‘PRAETORIAN’ GUARD? — “Published Report Ties Broward Republican Party Leaders To Campaign E-Mail Scandal,” by Red Broward’s Rupert Tarsey and Richard DeNapoli: “According to a bombshell report, Broward Republican Party leaders are accused of selling access to e-mail lists to Broward Democrat candidates. On Monday, Javier Manjarres of the Shark Tank reported an official grievance was filed with the Republican Party Of Florida (RPOF). He wrote, ‘The grievance alleges that these three individuals broke ‘for violations of the Loyalty Oaths and for conduct that is conflict with their role as a BREC member/office’ by selling Republicans lists (most likely to include the BREC membership list) to Democrats.’” Read more LEANS R — “Dems grapple with uncertain future in Florida after losses,” by The Hill’s Max Greenwood: “Democrats are grappling with how to carve a path forward in Florida after disappointing losses in two high-profile races that once fueled the party’s hopes of expanding its political footprint in the Sunshine State. The defeats suffered by gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum and Sen. Bill Nelson, both by ultra-close margins, have left Democrats struggling to point to one silver bullet that could have turned the tide of the races.” Read more ON THE RISE — “Parkland Shootings Contribute to A Rise In Florida Murders,” by CBS Miami: “A rise in murders in Florida can be attributed to the mass shooting at a Parkland high school. The school shooting that left 17 dead drove up the number of Florida murders during the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period last year. Overall, the number of Florida crimes in the first half of the year dropped by 8 percent. But the Florida Department of Law Enforcement reported 545 murders, including the 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.” Read more THE KEY? — “Freshwater may hold key to managing Lake O’s toxic algae, study finds,” by Miami Herald's Jenny Staletovich: “U.S. Geological Survey scientists tinkering around with freshwater blue-green algae from Lake Okeechobee have made a simple, yet potentially significant discovery: the amount of salty water needed to transform the tiny organisms from benign to toxic as they travel toward busy coasts. With the right planning, the discovery could help water managers prevent the kind of foul sliming that spreads along the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee rivers with every rainy season.” Read more THINK HARDER — “Two more dead dolphins found in Collier as experts theorize about cause,” by Naples Daily News’ Jake Allen: “The spate of dead dolphins washing up on beaches in Lee and Collier counties slowed Wednesday as experts theorized about what is causing the deaths. On Tuesday, 15 dolphins washed up dead in Collier and Lee counties, bringing the total to 37 since Nov. 21, said Blair Mase, a marine mammal stranding coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Two additional dolphins were found dead Wednesday on Collier beaches, Mase said.” Read more TAKING AIM — “Oliva’s problem with hospitals: ‘arbitrary prices,’” by POLITICO’s Alexandra Glorioso: State House Speaker José Oliva is hitting on a familiar health care policy theme for his chamber as he prepares for the upcoming legislative session: deregulate the hospital industry. With session still months away, he’s already identified a few hospital industry foes as policy priorities: do away with certificate of need laws, expand ambulatory surgical centers and build on price transparency. And, while he hasn’t given specifics on what he wants to do with roughly $300 million of what’s left of the more than $800 million in extra Medicaid dollars the state had been giving hospitals since the Florida House blocked Medicaid expansion in 2015, he said in an interview with POLITICO, “we’re looking at the rationale behind how those monies are paid out and if there’s a justification for the way they’re currently paid out,” potentially setting up another familiar fight that stalled in the last legislative session‘s final days. Read more[pro] EMPTY CABINET? — “Sierra Club seeks to disqualify Putnam, Patronis from power plant decision,” by POLITICO’s Bruce Ritchie: The Sierra Club is seeking to disqualify Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis from voting on a proposed Florida Power & Light Co. power plant in Broward County because of campaign contributions from the utility and other fossil fuel interests. The Cabinet is set to vote Friday on a siting permit for FPL's proposed 1,160-megawatt natural gas plant, which would replace an existing facility at the Florida Power & Light Co. site that uses two older gas units. The Sierra Club opposes the plant, arguing that burning gas will contribute to climate change and that plant infrastructure will be susceptible to sea level rise. But administrative law Judge Cathy Sellers, in a July recommendation to approve the permit, said FPL had shown the plant will reduce the utility's overall greenhouse gas emissions. Read more[pro] RISKY BUSINESS — “Florida needs its own climate change study, key scientist says,” by Bruce: A University of Miami scientist said today the state should commission its own study on the threats facing Florida from climate change. A federal report released last week that warned climate change will disrupt the economies of every region of the country in the coming years did not look closely enough at Florida, atmospheric scientist Ben Kirtman said on a conference call organized by ReThink Energy Florida. Kirtman said coastal development and building codes should take sea level rise into consideration. “And in fact I think it's important for Florida to start to think about how would they produce a climate assessment that is specific to Florida,” Kirtman said. “I think that is something that needs to be done.” Read more[pro] TIMBER! — “Cabinet to consider nearly 20,000-acre conservation purchase,” by Bruce: Gov. Rick Scott and the Cabinet are scheduled to consider purchasing a conservation easement on 19,224 acres in Dixie County at a Dec. 4 meeting. The proposed deal would reduce development while allowing the property to remain in timber production for the county’s rural economy, the state Department of Environmental Protection said in a purchase description. The property owner — Lyme Cross City Forest Co. — would be allowed to continue commercial timber harvesting in compliance with state “best management practices” except in wetlands. A company spokesman said those excluded wetlands cover about 8,000 acres of the property. Read more[pro] POLICY TIME — “Commentary: Governor-elect Ron DeSantis promised E-Verify. I hope he delivers,” by Orlando Sentinel’s Scott Maxwell: “In mounting his improbable victory for governor, Republican Ron DeSantis vowed to be something different. No more sacred cows. No more sucking up to special interests. It was one of the reasons many people, including me, thought he was a better choice than his primary competitor, Adam Putnam.” Read more TAX CUT UNCERTAINTY — “Looming sports betting debate, hurricane recovery costs cloud tax-cut package,” by POLITICO’s Arek Sarkissian: “Looming costs from Hurricane Michael may gobble up the cash on hand state lawmakers had hoped to have to build out next year's Florida budget and the tax cut package on which they have their eyes. Newly appointed House Appropriations Committee Chairman Travis Cummings said on Tuesday the more than $34.7 billion in mostly tax revenue predicted for next year may not cover the costs the state could face from the Oct. 10 hurricane. And a cash shortfall predicted in the next two years for non-essential budget items has also thrown the prospect of a tax cut package into uncertainty, Cummings said. Cummings, a Fleming Island Republican, said in an interview that major unavoidable costs such as Medicaid and education may also present challenges after the House and Senate begin budget talks. But he said he is still confident the House will at least propose a tax cut package next year.” Read more[pro] SPOTLIGHT — “Pasco schools psychologist comes under fire in transgender flap,” by Tampa Bay Times' Jeffrey Solochek: “The wrath of conservative groups opposed to what they see as special treatment of transgender students has come down hard on Pasco County schools in the past few weeks. And a district school psychologist who strives to help LGBTQ students adjust as they struggle with their identity has come directly into the crossfire.” Read more AWFUL — “Miami Herald Florida Keys reporter mauled by bull mastiff while on assignment,” by Miami Herald’s Howard Cohen: “A Miami Herald reporter was brutally attacked by a bull mastiff on Tuesday while on assignment. David Goodhue, who covers the Florida Keys, went to speak to the couple who run the Newport Boat Yard in Key Largo. More than a year after Hurricane Irma slammed the island chain, the Moore family had reached out to Goodhue to tell their story of how they are still struggling to get repairs to their business.” Read more OH, GOOD — “Jacksonville City Council strikes down proposed transparency reforms,” by Times-Union’s Christopher Hong: “The bill died in a 16-3 vote, a result foreshadowed last week after a council committee criticized it as draconian, burdensome and demeaning to the council’s reputation with the public. The bill’s sponsor, Councilwoman Anna Brosche, acknowledged its fate Tuesday before the final vote, saying she wanted ‘the public to know’ her colleagues denied her request for more time to change her proposal and instead moved to ‘kill’ an attempt to bring more transparency to local government.” Read more WARM UP — “Chilly manatees swarm to warmer waters at Blue Spring State Park — caught on camera,” by Orlando Sentinel’s Joe Mario Pedersen: “In most states the leaves change colors when it’s cold, but in Florida the manatees come home to roost. The cold front Floridians felt on Tuesday caused swarms of manatees to head into Blue Spring State Park in search of warmer waters, as seen on the state park’s live feed, as reported by Orlando Weekly.” Read more TRANSITIONS — Kelly Craighead will be the president and CEO of Cruise Lines International Association, taking over from Cindy D'Aoust.

375,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1817677," This week at progressive state blogs is designed specifically to focus attention on the writing and analysis of people focused on their home turf. Here is the December 1 edition. Inclusion of a blog post does not necessarily indicate my agreement with—or endorsement of—its contents.  Tom Van Alten at FortBoise of Idaho writes—Swan Songs: NYT proposes to my morning viewing that it's breaking news that George H.W. Bush is having a state funeral, but actually, no. He had a good, long life, some worthy accomplishments, some less-worthy things, and by comparison to some of what followed, he earned some genuine praise, which should suffice for a ceremony. I'm not going to take on the job of weighing his soul, or watching his funeral; someone can round up the highlights for me. It's worth highlighting the good things, I think. The Americans with Disabilities Act has been a boon for civil rights. The international acid rain treaty, from back when bipartisan progress for the environment was possible. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney highlighted that, and NAFTA, the ADA, and Bush's international stature. Defending the downing of civilian Iran Air Flight 655 was a not-great moment. Given the current administration's imagined (or anticipated) impunity for criminal acts, the Iran-Contra affair (""a hydra-headed scandal""), and the pardons that GHWB handed out just before he left office are worth another look. The timing doesn't seem like it will work quite the same for Trump, who can hardly claim he was ""out of the loop"" when he's been in the thick of the swamp since long before his inauguration day. Now that the special counsel has said that Trump's first national security advisor Michael Flynn was a key cooperator and should serve little prison time, David Rothkopf's Twitter thread takes a more critical view of the original bad acts. He points out that Flynn ""undercut norms of decency"" (does anybody remember norms of decency?!) ""in calling for a political opponent like Hillary Clinton to be locked up,"" even as he himself was serving other countries ahead of ours, for personal financial gain. Birds of a feather. Flynn's misdeeds pale in comparison to what his boss has done, and continues to do, obstructing justice and tampering with witnesses for the ongoing investigation, in plain sight. ""He was at the center of one of the darkest moments in the history of the American presidency,"" Rothkopf notes, of Flynn, near the end of his thread. This darkest moment, still in process. Juanita Jean Herownself at Juanita Jean’s of Texas writes—Numbers: I walked out to pick up the mail yesterday and my Republican across-the-street neighbor ambled over to smirk at me.  “What happened to that blue wave y’all were expecting?” Okay, now picture this—a slightly chubby old white man on social security and socialized medicine, thinks Trump won the mid terms. I looked at him with that “Have you had a stroke?” look that – not to brag – but, I’ve kinda perfected with this guy.  In a county that had not even one county wide elected Democrat now has them all. We won every race where we ran a Democrat. It wasn’t a wave, it was the earth shifting poles. And now there’s this:  “The Cook Political Report shows that the Democratic lead in the U.S. House popular vote for the 2018 midterms is now up to 8.5%.” “For comparison purposes, note that in 2010 – which was widely seen as a GOP ‘wave’ cycle – Republicans won the U.S. House popular vote by 6.6%. In 1994, which was seen as a Republican ‘revolution,’ the GOP won the U.S. House popular vote by 7.1%.” I’m putting that on a poster board in my front yard right across from his mailbox, dammit. Peter Athas at The Bayou Brief of Louisiana writes—Neelyisms: Translating Louisiana’s Junior Senator: I’m surely not the only one to remember Slate’s Bushisms feature. It was compiled by Jacob Weisberg who started it when he covered George W. Bush 2000 campaign. Weisberg was among the first to note W’s weird use of the language and penchant for malaprops. Weisberg kept at it for Bush’s entire presidency and even produced a successful book of Bushisms. The wit and wisdom of [Republican Sen.] John Neely Kennedy isn’t quite as spontaneous as your basic Bushism. It’s part of a carefully, albeit mysteriously, calculated image to portray a well-educated professional politician as a cracker barrel philosopher; a character straight out of the long-running teevee show, “Hee-Haw.” In short, our senator and former state treasurer thinks he’s Grandpa Jones only without the banjo and the droopy mustache: Neely may be a born-again Republican but his wisecracks are reminiscent of one of the most colorful politicians in Louisiana history: Three-time Democratic Governor and brother of the Kingfish, Earl K. Long. He was known in his later days as Uncle Earl. I use the term Gret Stet of Louisiana as an homage to Uncle Earl who knew his way around a colorful country wisecrack. As you will see directly, his favorite foil was New Orleans Mayor Delesseps (Chep) Morrison who he called Dellasoups. [...] The difference between Uncle Earlisms and Neelyisms is that Earl was being real whereas Neelyisms reflect a carefully crafted persona. At First Draft, I’ve called it “hicking it up.” I don’t recall as many hickified aphorisms from Neely’s long tenure as state treasurer, but he was a chronic kibitzer and soundbite machine for the Gret Stet political media. The wave of Neelyisms seems to have started during the 2016 campaign and exploded when Neely hit Capitol Hill. [This is followed by 20 selected Neelyisms from Athas, the seventh of which specifically refers to Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch but apparently has been used in reference to others as well]: “I guess what I want is a cross between Socrates and Dirty Harry and I believe you just might be that person.” scharrison at BlueNC writes—$34,310 debt owed by Harris campaign for fraudulent ballots:  Buying a Congressional seat can be costly: In a filing with the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Harris’s campaign listed an obligation of $34,310 for “reimbursement payment for Bladen absentee, early voting poll workers; reimbursement door to door.” The disclosure form said the campaign owed the money to Red Dome Group, the Charlotte-area consulting firm that Mr. Harris hired for his campaign. Red Dome, in turn, contracted with L. McCrae Dowless Jr., a Bladen County political operative who has been accused of collecting absentee ballots from voters in a potentially illegal effort to tip the election toward the Republican nominee. Which exposes an exceptionally nasty side to this story: A lot of those small donors, squeezing fifty bucks out of their family's budget in support of an evangelical pastor, only to have their money used to steal or stifle the votes of their fellow citizens.[...] You may have also noticed Dallas Woodhouse taking a surprising new stance, signaling a new election might be acceptable. But here's the thing: He wants *two* new elections, a Primary and a General Election. Why, you might ask? It's painfully obvious. Mark Harris is tainted, and will likely lose if he runs against McCready again. Dallas wants to change the players in the middle of the game, get Pittenger in there instead, because not only is he innocent, he's also a victim as well. Dallas sees that scenario as the only way the GOP can retain that seat, and he's probably right. James Rowen at The Political Environment of Wisconsin writes—Walker begins the revisionism to justify more lame-duck revision: Yeah, that's not the braggadocio he tossed the fake David Koch's way. ""Yep. This is our moment. ""Is there anything Walker will not spin? He is going out in full contradiction to what he demanded [former Democratic Gov. Jim] Doyle not do eight years ago. He enjoys the back-stabs and the stealth. He is incapable of empathy and honesty. There is a reason why PolitiFact has found his ""false"" and ""pants on fire"" statements total more than twice those rated ""true."" He regrets nothing. Trish Nelson at Blog for Iowa writes—Sinclair Must-See Segments Intended To Create Fear And Influence Elections: Have you ever thought about what it would take to make you want to run out of the United States on foot to Canada taking nothing more than what you could carry?  And what if you had only flip flops for shoes or no shoes at all?  We in the United States can’t even imagine it. What circumstances would be bad enough to make you not only think about fleeing the country, but actually do it? News stories do not tend to focus on what exactly is going on that is causing people to run for their lives. It’s always, “oh look at the violence and drama going on at the border!”  Looping video of people running, American soldiers, making it look like a war scene. Then little to no information laying out what the circumstances are that are causing people to choose to flee their country on foot. And that’s the mainstream media. The right wing propaganda outlets show pretty much the same pictures and video. But they use the scene to stir up fear and anger in viewers by calling people fleeing for their lives an “invasion.”  Now we not only have right wing radio blanketing the publicly owned airwaves around the country and in Iowa, Sinclair Broadcasting has taken over the parallel television markets, and their corporate CEO is requiring local stations to broadcast right wing narratives. from Media Matters for America: Sinclair Broadcasting, an arm of the right wing propaganda machine, focusing on swing states in rural America is characterizing a large group of poor, desperate, barefoot families  running for their lives as an “invasion.”  Sinclair’s latest “must-run” defends tear-gassing migrant children, warns of an “attempted invasion” Sinclair’s Boris Epshteyn: “The fact of the matter is that this is an attempted invasion of our country. Period.” On November 26, Sinclair chief political analyst and former Trump aide Boris Epshteyn released a new “must-run” segment for the company that defended the use of tear gas on these families and attempted to stoke fear, saying the group of migrants is “attempting to storm” the border in an “attempted invasion of our country.” Watch the video here. Louis Fowler at The Lost Ogle of Oklahoma writes—A Cold Day in Hell: Brigadoon Army Surplus vs. The Oklahoma Winter: Oklahoma winters are, to me at least, always so post-apocalyptic. It doesn’t help matters that, around this time, the local news channels begin their yearly holiday of frightening the populace with the latest in ratings-grabbing theories of a fully winterized Armageddon of sorts. Fearing a sudden sheet of permafrost descending upon me very soon, I preeminently made a trip to Brigadoon, 1805 S. Sunnylane Rd. in Del City. Advertised as the last “genuine” military surplus store left not only in town but in Oklahoma, it was a good time and a great place to get a jump on avoiding this year’s ultimately frigid death by using and abusing the best of the best of military trash and treasures. A budget-minded survivalist’s wet dream—well, I guess more frozen than wet—Brigadoon is really the only place that those of us who dwell in the shacks, lean-tos and shanties that are sprinkled throughout Oklahoma City can go to find the gear needed to survive another winter in this Okie Hell; from thermal blankets to formal rations, the goods at Brigadoon can really take the edge off as you breathe your last few visible breaths, all for just a couple of American greenbacks. Now, whatever philosophical disagreements I may have with the owners or customers—per the vehemently pro-Trump discussion overheard as I was scouring the aisles—they are immediately put to the wayside because in this one moment, right or flight aside, we are all bonded in one common goal: to make it out mostly unscathed to a far more first-worldian season of a virgin mother’s vernal warmth in a couple of months. Trump, schrump…pass the Hot-Hands […] Cory Allen Heidelberger at Dakota Free Press writes—Deutsch Plans No Potty-Panic Bill for Noem—What Changed? I shouldn’t look a gift horse in the mouth. If radical right-wing theocrat Fred Deutsch says he won’t use his triumphant return to the Legislature to push an anti-transgender potty bill, I should just say, “Thank you, Fred!” and let it be. I should be thrilled that I don’t have to waste the entire Legislative Session beating down (again) stereotypes and paranoia and outright liesabout my transgender neighbors and can focus instead on the budget, nepotism, and crony corruption. But something doesn’t ring right here in Deutsch’s denial of an opportunity for Kristi Noem to fulfill one of the key fundagelical promises on which she campaigned. An issue that Deutsch and his extremist colleagues saw as an urgent matter of child safety two years ago suddenly requires no Legislative attention: Incoming Republican Rep. Fred Deutsch told The Associated Press this week that he doesn’t see the urgency under President Donald Trump. Deutsch said he proposed the bill in 2016 to push back against federal overreach during former President Barack Obama’s administration. “I’ve not heard of anybody else that’s going to bring a bathroom bill. I hope not,” said Deutsch, who is coming back to the House after deciding not run for re-election in 2016 [“‘Bathroom Bill’ Sponsor Won’t Try Again During 2019 Session,” AP via Education Week, 2018.12.07]. I don’t recall in 2015 and 2016 hearing Deutsch and friends emphasize that the primary threat was federal overreach; they insisted that children were in peril of peeping pervs. In 2017 and 2018, Deutsch and the radical right didn’t cite the ascent of Trump as the reason they could hold off on potty-panic legislation; they said they’d wait until mean old veto-crank Daugaard would be replaced by someone more amenable to their fundie agenda.[...]  A staffer at Colorado Pols writes—Democrats To Dominate State House Committees: As the Denver Post’s Nic Garcia reports, Republicans in the Colorado House of Representatives are set to be less influential than they have been in decades, with the 2019 lopsided Democratic majority resulting in big Democratic majorities on every House committee: The consequences for Colorado conservatives following stinging losses in November are coming into sharper focus at the statehouse. Democrats will have a three-vote majority on state House legislative committees, which vet, debate and amend potential bills before the full body deliberates them, leadership in the lower chamber announced Sunday. The increase in power means Republicans and the right-leaning interest groups that rely on the GOP to advance their agendas will be at a significant disadvantage in January. A three-vote majority on committees for Democrats effectively mutes House Republicans, but also gives House Democratic leadership a comfortable margin within their own caucus to ensure that one or two holdouts are not able to stall priority legislation on behalf of special interests. As Garcia reports, this is the largest majority that Democrats have enjoyed in the Colorado House since 1959—which we shouldn’t have to remind readers was a very different Democratic Party than today’s. [...] To the victor goes the spoils–and when you win this big, there are plenty of spoils to go around. Don Pogreba at The Montana Post writes—Republican Legislative Priorities: More Guns in Schools: There’s one thing observers of the Montana Legislature can count on: faced with important budget decisions and policy questions, Montana Republicans in the Legislature will spend time every session pushing bills to rile up that small part of their constituency who believe that more guns in more places will, despite all the available evidence, make Montana safer. And they’re already back at it. A quick look at the bill draft requests shows that a number of Republicans have once again come to the Legislature armed with bill requests that would undermine local control of schools while drastically reducing student and teacher safety. Chief among these proposals are two requests are those from Senator Keith Regier, who has one draft likely to replicate his badly-named 2017 “Montana School Safety Act” and another to hold a referendum on the same when it inevitably fails to become law. Assuming Regier’s proposal hasn’t changed substantially since the 2017 session, it would not only make it easier for school staff to bring weapons to school, but it would prohibit school districts from setting their own policies prohibiting guns on campus. State law already lets school boards permit concealed carry on campus, but as of 2017, only three very small districts had any armed teachers. A story from the Billings Gazette in 2017 illustrated a likely reason why: In Cut Bank, self-described “gun nut” and superintendent Wade Johnson has been on both sides of the debate. A few years ago, he asked school trustees for permission to carry a gun. They said no. And after reviewing research that showed New York City Police had hit their target 18 percent of the time in shootouts, he now agrees. “That’s unacceptable in a school,” he said. Despite the macho posturing of Republican legislators who imagine they’d calmly stop a mass shooting on a campus, the presence of more guns would likely only create more chaos in an actual shooting situation and the Parkland tragedy demonstrates that even trained law enforcement on the scene is no guarantee that a shooter would be stopped.

376,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1819702,"A new white supremacist bigot has been arrested and is being held in a Washington state jail under the state’s hate crime law. According to the Everett, Washington, Daily Herald, 20-year-old Dakota Reed was arrested on Friday and held through the weekend. According to the report, sheriff’s detectives and the FBI “seized 12 firearms, ammo, gun magazines,” as well as some white supremacist notes. Reed was being tracked by authorities after posting numerous anti-Semitic diatribes from a handful of pseudonym-handled accounts. He also seems to have been amassing a particularly large arsenal of weapons, all while threatening to shoot up schools or synagogues. He wrote in early December about his parents asking why he owned military-style guns. “To kill people,” he answered, according to his post. “Why else would I own them?” In one post, Reed apparently uses the phrase “pulling a Dylan[n] Roof.” This comes only a week or so after an Ohio woman and her boyfriend were arrested and accused of plotting a mass murder hate crime. The woman, Elizabeth Lecron, was one of only four known winners to correspond with Dylann Roof while he sits on death row for murdering nine churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. Reed for his part seems to have been pretty scary. After holding him through the weekend, the Snohomish County sheriff’s office filed paperwork Monday morning asking for an extreme-risk protection order against Reed. The order would prohibit Reed from having access to firearms. According to the Herald, Reed remains in jail pending a bail hearing. Remember how the incoming Republican administration wanted everyone to believe that the Black Lives Matter movement was the burgeoning domestic terrorist scene to watch out for? Remember how anyone with even the smallest capacity for logic wondered how that worked, considering that virtually any and every mass shooting or bombing conceived and carried out on American soil was done by a white guy? So here’s another white guy planning on killing people for not being his perverted version of what he considers “white.” ",2018-12-17 22:30:19,Dylann Roof supporter arrested for stockpiling weapons and threatening domestic terrorism,,115,http://www.dailykos.com

Wednesday morning when she arrived at Columbia University for work, Jewish professor Elizabeth Midlarsky was met with two swastikas and the slur “yid” spray-painted in red on her office walls. The following day, and on the other side of the country in southwest Los Angeles, someone spray-painted white swastikas across a section of the celebrated black history murals on Crenshaw Avenue, defacing the figures of the female leaders of the Black Panther movement. Both incidents are being investigated as hate crimes. Both incidents also fit into a string of upsetting anti-Semitic events that have occurred throughout the country this year. “I was in shock,” Midlarsky, who focuses much of her teaching, research, and writing on the Holocaust, told campus newspaper the Columbia Spectator of the incident. “I stopped for a moment, because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.” In Los Angeles, artist Enkone Goodlow, who painted the Black Panther section of the mural, immediately returned to paint over the swastikas after learning about the graffiti. “I was hurt because that portion of the mural has never been defaced,” Goodlow told CNN. While these two events are the most high-profile anti-Semitic crimes of the week, they are not isolated. Goucher College students woke up on Thursday morning to find swastikas spray painted on their Maryland campus. It was the second time this occurred this month; a suspect was arrested. In New Jersey, two middle schools and a high school, all in Union County, found swastikas and other hateful graffiti drawn on their school property as well. Nor is it an issue isolated to this week: As Vox’s Tara Burton reported, there’s been a steady increase in anti-Semitic incidents and hate crimes since the 2016 presidential campaign season. In 2017, the last year for which complete data is available, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an advocacy group dedicated to combating anti-Semitism, found that there had been 1,986 reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States that year, including acts of vandalism as well as physical violence. That figure was a 57 percent increase from 2016, which itself had seen a 35 percent uptick in incidents from 2015. Generally, anti-Semitism has been on the rise over the past few years — there was a nearly 60 percent uptick in incidents in the first year of Trump’s presidency, according to a report by the Anti-Defamation League. And with the October mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11, 2018 has been particularly devastating. Trump’s presidency and the nationalist rhetoric he espouses have been blamed by many for the rising climate of extremism and hate in America. In anticipation of his trip to Pittsburgh after the synagogue shooting, a group of Jewish leaders in the community wrote a letter asking him not to come. They said the attack was, as Vox’s Emily Stewart put it, “the ‘direction culmination’ of the president’s influence.” Both the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter and the man who mailed prominent Democrats bombs earlier this fall both expressed xenophobic sentiments and attacked high-profile political figures as “globalists,” Stewart noted: It’s not hard to see the similarities between these men’s beliefs and Trump’s rhetoric. The president often complains about globalists and at a recent rally declared himself a nationalist. The term “globalist” is often considered code for anti-Semitism. Anti-semitism has long been a rising problem in Europe, but as recently as 2014, scholars thought it was not as serious an issue within the United States. All it takes is one look at Midlarksy’s office walls to see how rapidly that’s changed. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism? Millions turn to Vox to understand what’s happening in the news.

A database, going back to 1970, shows there were more incidents and more deaths in 2018 than any other year on record. If it seemed like 2018 was a particularly bad year for gun violence in schools, that’s because it was. According to data from the US Naval Postgraduate School, there were 94 school gun violence incidents this year — a record high since 1970, which is as far back as the data goes, and 59 percent higher than the previous record of 59 in 2006. The database counts “each and every instance a gun is brandished, is fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time of day, or day of week,” according to the project. The project pulls from a variety of sources, including media reports and government agencies, to collect its data. Separately, the project also tracks deaths. By this metric, 2018 was also the worst year on record. So far, 55 people, including the shooter, were killed in school gun violence. The second-worst annual death toll was 40 in 1993. (To put these numbers in context, there were nearly 39,000 gun deaths, including homicides and suicides, in the US in 2016.) The great majority of incidents tracked involved handguns: 911 involved one or more handguns, 76 one or more rifles, 47 one shotgun, 33 a combination of weapons, and 230 unknown. Other data backs up that 2018 was particularly bad for school gun violence. The database from Everytown, a gun control advocacy group, found 86 incidents so far this year in which “a firearm discharges a live round inside or into a school building or on or onto a school campus or grounds, as documented by the press.” That’s the highest number of incidents going back to 2013, when Everytown began tracking the data. School shootings this year gave way to a new movement for stricter gun laws, with the March for Our Lives taking off after a gunman in Parkland, Florida, in February killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. But it doesn’t seem that 2018 was a particularly abnormal year for mass shootings, regardless of whether they happened on school grounds. The Gun Violence Archive’s data, visualized by Vox in map form, indicates that there have been 328 mass shootings so far in 2018, or nearly one a day, resulting in 365 killed and 1,301 wounded. That’s roughly in line with recent years going back to 2015, which have averaged about one mass shooting a day. (The Gun Violence Archive defines mass shootings as any incident in which four or more people were shot but not necessarily killed, excluding the shooter, in a similar time or place, which differs from some other groups’ definitions.) Meanwhile, gun homicides as a whole have trended down over the decades as crime has steadily dropped in the US — by roughly half since the 1990s. It’s not clear why 2018 appeared to be a particularly bad year for gun violence in schools. But at the international level, America has long been an outlier among developed nations when it comes to gun violence — and the experts and research suggest that the US’s abundance of firearms and extremely lax firearm laws have helped create its gun problem. America’s gun problem can be broken down into two parts. First, America has uniquely weak gun laws. Other developed nations at the very least require one or more background checks and almost always something more rigorous beyond that to get a gun, from specific training courses to rules for locking up firearms to more arduous licensing requirements to specific justifications, besides self-defense, for owning a gun. In the US, even a background check isn’t a total requirement; the current federal law is riddled with loopholes and snared by poor enforcement, so there are many ways around even a basic background check. There are simply very few barriers, if any, to getting a gun in the US. (Although some states, like Massachusetts, have worked to change that.) Second, the US has a ton of guns. It has far more than not just other developed nations but any other country, period. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey. Both of these factors come together to make it uniquely easy for someone with any violent intent to find a firearm, allowing them to carry out a horrific shooting. This is borne out in the statistics. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data for 2012 compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, is also pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths. Researchers have found this to be true not just with homicides but also with suicides (which in recent years were around 60 percent of US gun deaths), domestic violence, and violence against police. As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found, it’s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime: Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. “A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.” This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone. Similarly, every country in the world has bigots, extremists, and disturbed people who may want to carry out mass atrocities. But in the US, it’s uniquely easy to do so because so many guns are readily available. Researchers have found that stricter gun laws could help. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives. A review of the US evidence by RAND also linked some gun control measures, including background checks, to reduced injuries and deaths. That doesn’t mean that bigots, extremists, disturbed people, or anyone else will never be able to carry out a shooting in places with strict gun laws. Even the strictest gun laws can’t prevent every shooting. And guns are not the only contributor to violence. Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, alcohol consumption, and the strength of criminal justice systems. There are also some evidence-based policies that could help outside the realm of gun control, including more stringent regulations and taxes on alcohol, changes in policing, and behavioral intervention programs. But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s loose access to guns is a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. So America, with its lax laws and abundance of firearms, makes it uniquely easy for people to commit massacres. Until the US confronts that issue, it will continue seeing more gun deaths than the rest of the developed world. For more on America’s gun problem, read Vox’s explainer.

Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he will resign at the end of February, citing disagreements with the president over foreign policy. Mattis is just the latest in a long line of senior administration staff, from John Kelly to Nikki Haley, who announced this year that they are leaving the White House. Mattis’s resignation comes after Trump’s decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria—a move that did not come as a shock to longtime Syria-policy experts. Mattis, who has always understood Trump’s deficiencies, agreed to serve him out of a sense of patriotism, writes Jeffrey Goldberg, and his departure signals a dangerous third phase of Trump’s foreign policy. But in coverage of Mattis’s resignation, Conor Friedersdorf writes that the news media has failed “to treat the withdrawal of troops [from Syria] as a legitimate, reasonable position.” In the final Politics & Policy Daily of 2018, we’re featuring one last round of standout Atlantic politics stories from the past 12 months, including a complex portrait of Heidi Cruz, an assessment of the impact former Attorney General Jeff Sessions has had on the legal gains of the civil-rights era, and an intimate look at the unique weight of grief in the aftermath of the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. — Elaine Godfrey, Madeleine Carlisle, and Olivia Paschal The End of Civil RightsVann R.

Companies used to remain mum on any topic deemed impolite for the dinner table — religion, sex, politics. But in the Trump era, even traditionally apolitical brands like Walmart have taken quiet action, withdrawing their financial support from public figures with views that clearly cross a line. And many companies are being even more explicit about their views, weighing in on subjects like women’s rights, gun control, and immigration. In today’s political climate in which rallies, boycotts, and public outrage are constantly in the news, it may be worth the risk for companies to speak out about their politics, according to marketing experts. “It used to be you didn’t want to upset anyone,” said Jessica Li, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Kansas. “But studies show that the country is very divided, and if it’s divided politically, brands might feel like they’re able to take a stronger stand and get more support from their target market. It’s a way for them to get people talking about their brand.” Accordingly, a series of companies this year either took stands of some sort or continued their political activism from years past. While certain brands, such as Patagonia, have made social issues a part of their image well before Donald Trump entered the White House, others are wading into the political sphere for the first time and finding that the results aren’t always predictable — or profitable. At a time when social justice has become trendy and being politically outspoken is viewed as a sign of integrity, it can be hard to distinguish the companies that want to cash in on a movement from the ones that are truly invested in the work. But Patagonia’s long history of efforts to better the environment separates the retailer from others that have only embraced sociopolitical causes since the 2016 election. Months before Trump edged out Hillary Clinton to win the presidential race, Patagonia co-founder Yvon Chouinard was featured in a New Yorker profile about how the company had funneled its eco-conscious sensibilities and anti-corporate ethos into a successful clothing business. The story pointed out how even in the early 1990s, Patagonia was training employees about its commitment to environmental ethics. So in November, when Patagonia announced jaw-dropping plans for the corporate tax cut it received courtesy of the Trump administration, the announcement did not come across as a publicity stunt. “Based on last year’s irresponsible tax cut, Patagonia will owe less in taxes this year — $10 million less, in fact,” CEO Rose Marcario said via LinkedIn. “Instead of putting the money back into our business, we’re responding by putting $10 million back into the planet. Our home planet needs it more than we do.” Marcario argued that since taxes protect the vulnerable and public lands, Trump had given corporations a break “at the expense of our planet.” So Patagonia, which already sets aside a portion of sales to environmental causes through its “1% for the Planet” campaign, will donate its $10 million tax cut to environmental groups rather than reinvest it in the company. “They have a long history of supporting environmental activism,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School, of the company. “It makes perfect sense for Patagonia to be very visible in standing up for wilderness areas and for the environment. That’s what makes Patagonia such a magnetic brand.” For Patagonia, combining its efforts to help the environment with criticism of the president — Chouinard has called Trump “the perfect person to take us to the apocalypse” — has paid off. When Patagonia announced after the 2016 election that it would donate Black Friday profits to environmental groups, sales reached $10 million, and the company won 25,000 new shoppers. While Patagonia may be a leading retailer in environmental activism, it is not in the fight alone. Last year, the CEOs of more than 350 outdoor businesses signed a joint letter urging US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke to protect national monuments and public lands. And a few months later, when President Trump announced plans to cut the size of two national monuments in Utah — Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante — REI issued a statement about the decision and posted it on its website to urge the public to declare support for public lands on social media. “REI will not retreat from our strong belief that there is common ground in the outdoors,” the statement said. “We will continue to pursue bipartisan support to protect public lands and prevent death by a thousand cuts. REI members can be assured that we will honor our shared passion for our public lands, dedicating time and resources to leaving them healthier for future generations.” REI pointed out how the outdoor recreation economy has an estimated value of $887 billion and employs more than 7.6 million workers. In essence, scaling back on public lands hurts not just the earth but also workers and the economy. When Nike in September unveiled its ad campaign featuring former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, as well as LeBron James and Serena Williams, the news trended on social media and made headlines across the world. Kaepernick, after all, has been roundly criticized by conservatives since 2016, when he started kneeling during the national anthem before NFL games to highlight anti-black police violence. President Trump indirectly described him as a “son of a bitch,” and the right has largely mischaracterized his protest as targeting veterans and the American flag rather than police misconduct. The athlete’s football career has also come to a standstill after his peaceful political protest. No NFL team has been willing to sign him, and he’s sued the team’s owners for colluding to keep him out of the league. Given that Kaepernick has become a political lightning rod for conservatives and a persona non grata in the NFL, the idea that a major sports brand would feature him in an ad seemed implausible, but Nike took what marketing experts call a “calculated risk” and included him in its campaign marking the 30th anniversary of its “Just Do It” slogan. “Nike knows their audience,” said Jerry Davis, a University of Michigan professor of management and sociology. “They very carefully made this decision. Companies now have much better real-time intelligence about their customers. They know whether the kind of people who buy Nike are more likely to be pro- or anti-Kaepernick and what’s the likely reaction to this marketing. It was a calculated move but a smart one. Politics infuses everything now, and companies can’t escape that.” The reaction to the Nike ad was swift. While Kaepernick’s fans expressed their delight, his detractors took to social media to upload images of themselves burning their Nike shoes, and some state, city, and college officials took steps to ban the brand. News outlets reported that Nike’s shares tumbled the day after the ad’s September 3 debut, but they neglected to mention that shares for its competitors, like Adidas and Puma, fell as well. Rather than hurt Nike, Kaepernick may have actually helped the company; its stock surged by 5 percent in the three weeks after the campaign’s premiere. The quarterback may be a polarizing figure, but his loyal fan base is also why his San Francisco 49ers jersey continues to be a top seller two years since he last played a pro football game. Featuring him in its “Just Do It” campaign likely endeared Nike to the millennial fans who value companies that embrace social causes. That said, it’s worth noting that Nike never endorsed Kaepernick’s political views. The commercial simply honors those willing to “believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.” “When you watch the ad, you see Nike is supporting the idea of authenticity and being truthful to yourself, and that’s Colin Kaepernick,” Calkins said. “It reinforced Nike’s reputation for standing up for athletes, for saluting the individual.” Nike did not face a backlash for never explicitly backing Kaepernick’s views in its ad. Last year, however, Pepsi sparked a controversy when it released a nothingburger of an ad featuring model Kendall Jenner handing a soft drink to a police officer during a fictional political protest. Not only was the ad’s message unclear but critics also took issue with the fact that it centered a privileged white model not known for championing social causes. The verdict? Pepsi was full of it. “Pepsi wanted to talk about social issues, but they also wanted to have mass appeal,” Li said. “People wondered if the commercial was really authentic. Did they really care, or were they capitalizing on where our society is right now to make more money? They used Kendall Jenner in the commercial, but she is not like a Kaepernick; she’s a model. To put her in a commercial where she’s fixing these issues she hasn’t spoken about or experienced didn’t feel right.” The soft drink maker ultimately pulled the ad and offered an apology for appearing to capitalize on the social justice movements that have characterized the Trump era. In April, Starbucks had to do more than apologize when an employee at a Philadelphia store called the police on two black patrons for trespassing. The call was made just minutes after the men, who were waiting for a business associate to arrive, entered the Starbucks. To the public, the incident was a clear case of racial profiling, and the fact that it happened at Starbucks, a corporation that had previously urged customers to discuss race relations with its baristas, compounded the incident. Facing boycotts and public outrage, Starbucks decided to close its US stores for an afternoon of racial bias training. It was an unprecedented move that signaled to customers that it was making a good-faith effort to restore the public’s trust. And it likely inspired the Nordstrom Rack president to make a trip to personally apologize to three black youth falsely accused of shoplifting at a Missouri store. Today, both ads and apologies have to seem authentic. Taking a political stand may be the morally right thing for a company to do, but that doesn’t mean it won’t face consequences. After the mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school on Valentine’s Day, Dick’s Sporting Goods announced that it would no longer sell assault-style weapons and that it would stop selling guns to anyone younger than 21. The retailer went on to reportedly hire gun control lobbyists in April. News of that development led major gun companies to stop doing business with Dick’s. O.F. Mossberg & Sons Inc., MKS Supply, and Springfield Armory all announced they would sever their relationship with the retailer, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation announced plans to revoke Dick’s membership. The National Rifle Association also painted Dick’s as an enemy to the Second Amendment in an April tweet. .@DICKS decision isn’t focusing on the actual problem, what it is doing is punishing law-abiding citizens. What a waste, and what a strange business model. #DefendTheSecond #2A #NRA https://t.co/mUNmV6O1ot It’s unclear how the controversy over its gun control stance will shake out for the business. Although the retailer may have alienated the gun industry, just 10 percent of Dick’s revenues come from gun sales. In the third quarter of this year, earnings were higher than expected, but shares were down overall. Dick’s may have won praise for daring to get political when corporations were once notoriously silent about hot-button issues, but it has a markedly different audience from Nike. Marketing experts like Li characterized the typical Nike fan as younger and more politically liberal than the average Dick’s customer, which is why the sports goods retailer has seen some of its business relationships severed as it backs gun control. It’s not the only company that has faced a backlash for advocating for a political cause. When Delta ended its discount program for NRA members in February, it lost out on a $40 million tax break from the state of Georgia, where the airline is based. Georgia’s lieutenant governor also lashed out at the company in a tweet. I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA.  Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back. Immigration has proven to be nearly as divisive issue for companies as gun control has been. Corporations that have advocated for immigrants continue to be entangled in heated debates, or even legal action, as a result. Given that Trump campaigned on the promise of a border wall, it’s no surprise that the United States’ treatment of immigrants and asylum seekers has emerged as one of the most pressing issues of his presidency. The Trump administration has cut the number of refugees allowed into the US, created travel bans, and separated migrant children from their families. These policies are diametrically opposed to the values that Chobani Yogurt CEO Hamdi Ulukaya, an immigrant from Turkey, has tried to impart to the public. Since 2010, Ulukaya has made a point of hiring immigrants and refugees to work at Chobani, leading him to become the target of misinformation campaigns. The right has falsely accused him of trying to beef up the nation’s Muslim population, and conservative conspiracy theorist Alex Jones said the executive supported “migrant rapists,” according to CNN. As immigrants face multilayered attacks in a nation overrun with xenophobia, Ulukaya has found himself speaking out on behalf of immigrants, especially to counter some of Trump’s remarks. “I have nothing against America first, but ‘humanity first too,’” Ulukaya told CNN during a September event for his nonprofit called Tent Partnership for Refugees. Founded in 2016, Tent focuses on finding private sector solutions for the refugee crisis. The fact that Ulukaya launched a nonprofit to help refugees and made a point to hire immigrants and refugees at Chobani years before Trump took office makes it clear that his advocacy for this group is hardly a marketing ploy. In September, he won the Atlantic Council’s Global Citizen Award. That month alone, he got 20 companies to commit to hiring refugees or to support their efforts to start new lives. Uniqlo, Hilton, Barilla, and Microsoft are among the brands who made the most recent pledge. Microsoft has also advocated for immigrants by taking part in a lawsuit, along with Princeton University and one of its students, against the federal government’s decision to sunset the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In August, the US District Court in Washington, DC, reasserted its April finding that the decision to end DACA, which benefits unauthorized immigrants brought to the US as children, was unlawful. Microsoft took part in the lawsuit because the company employs many immigrant workers. “A lasting solution for DREAMers has become an economic imperative and a humanitarian necessity,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, about the court ruling. “... DREAMers grew up in this country, attended our schools, pay taxes and contribute to our communities. They deserve bipartisan action by Congress.” Since the dawn of the industrial age, corporations have battled the idea that they’re evil. While that perception hasn’t vanished, companies increasingly grapple with the notion that to do good, they must act. Today, greed and exploitation continue to mark businesses as morally bankrupt, but so does failure to speak out during an age when many refuse to tolerate silence, politeness, and thoughts and prayers any longer. Social action has always been a matter of life and death, but when migrant children are being placed behind bars, mass shootings have grown routine, and the climate is changing, taking a stand now signals that a company has values.

The crime rate in America’s 30 most populous cities may have hit its lowest point since 1990 this year, according to a new report from the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy think tank. The report analyzed data from the US’s 30 largest cities, finding drops in the rates of crime, violent crime, and particularly murder (although not all of the cities provided complete data). Brennan researchers Ames Grawert and Cameron Kimble extrapolated the available data to project the full crime rates for 2018 in the biggest US cities. They found that the murder rate fell this year by nearly 6 percent — fueled especially by big drops in the murder rates in Chicago and San Francisco and a smaller decline in Baltimore. The overall crime rate is projected to drop by 1.8 percent, putting the crime rate in these cities at its “lowest since at least 1990,” Brennan found. Violent crime is also projected to drop by 2.7 percent. Not every city is expected to see declines. For example, Washington, DC, and Houston are expected to see increases in the murder rate of 39.5 percent and 22.6 percent, respectively, according to Brennan. Only 22 cities provided Brennan with data for crime and violent crime, but all 30 provided data for murder. The findings largely support Brennan’s earlier 2018 report from September. This would be the second year of good news, after the FBI confirmed that crime and murder rates fell in 2017 too. That stands in contrast to an increase in the murder rates in 2015 and 2016, but reflects a decades-long trend toward less crime and murder in the US. Brennan has been putting out these reports over the past few years to give a more up-to-date estimate of crime trends. The FBI releases a national report with crime statistics each year, but with a big delay; the FBI’s full report for 2017, for example, came out after Brennan released its first report on 2018 in September. “We think there is a lot of misinformation on crime and crime rates,” Inimai Chettiar, director of the justice program at the Brennan Center, previously told me. “Certain politicians put out all sorts [of claims] on crime that not only tend to alarm the public, but also bring out really bad and unnecessary policy changes,” she added, citing mass incarceration and an immigration crackdown. “Before we’re even having those policy debates about what needs to be done to solve the problem, we need to make sure whether there actually is a problem or not.” Brennan’s numbers are projections, so they might not be completely accurate, and they’ll be updated as the group gets more data. But until we get the FBI’s full national crime data for 2018 in the late summer or fall of next year, the Brennan report is the best we have to go by. And it’s good news. The 2015 and 2016 increases in the murder rate got a lot of attention, with President Donald Trump and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions often bringing them up in speeches to justify “tough on crime” policies. But before they were able to implement such policies and let them take root (especially in local and state jurisdictions, where federal policymakers have very limited power), the rates already seem to be dropping. Criminologists still aren’t sure why murder in particular appeared to spike so much in 2015 and 2016. Some argued that there might have been a “Ferguson effect,” named after the city in Missouri that exploded into protests over the police shooting of Michael Brown: Due to protests against police brutality over the past few years, police were, the theory goes, scared off from proactive policing, emboldening criminals. Other experts argued a different kind of Ferguson effect: Widely reported incidents of police brutality and racial disparities in police use of force led to elevated distrust in law enforcement, which makes it much harder for police to solve and prevent crimes. Yet many criminologists cautioned that it’s also possible 2015 and 2016’s increases were blips in the data, not a new long-term trend. This isn’t unprecedented; in 2005 and 2006, the murder rate in the US increased before continuing its long-term decline — to new record lows — in the ensuing years. Since the murder rate in particular is generally low, it’s prone to big statistical fluctuations. As one example, Brennan found that Las Vegas saw a 23.5 percent increase in its murder rate in 2017, but that was due to the mass shooting that killed 58 people. A single event, albeit a very bad one, led to a dramatic spike. That’s why criminologists generally demand several years of data before they declare a significant crime trend. It now looks possible — though we’ll need more years of data to confirm — that 2015 and 2016 were replays of 2005 and 2006. If that holds, then perhaps the US isn’t in the middle of the “American carnage” that Trump has warned about. For more on what works to combat crime and violence, read Vox’s explainer.

382,https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/sandy-hook-elementary-sends-students-home-early-bomb-threat-massacre-anniversary/,"Students at Sandy Hook Elementary School were sent home Friday after a bomb threat on the sixth anniversary of a massacre that killed 20 first-graders and six educators. Newtown police said the threat was called in about 9 a.m., and the school was evacuated, reported NECN. Police said the threat was not believed to be credible, but they said it would be taken seriously and fully investigated. Two other threats were also made Thursday in Newtown, according to police. The school building where the children and educators were gunned down Dec. 14, 2012, was demolished and a new school built on the same site. The victims' families have been targeted for harassment over the years by conspiracy theorists who believe the shooting was faked. Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney (WY) on Tuesday fired back at Republicans critical of her role in the commission to investigate Jan. 6, saying, ""This is absolutely not a game. This is deadly serious."" ""There are some in my party, including Leader McCarthy, who continue to act as though this is about partisan politics, I think it's really sad. I think it's a disgrace,"" she told ABC's George Stephanopoulos.    According to a report from Forbes, lawyers who brought lawsuits attacking the 2020 presidential election results in Michigan by alleging voter fraud are attempting to use Donald Trump's words to avoid sanctions. On the evening before House select committee opens hearings into the Jan 6th Capitol riot that was inspired by accusations that the election was stolen from Trump, the so-called ""Kraken"" attorneys, including one-time Trump attorney Sidney Powell, made a new filing.        Former president Donald Trump's alleged efforts to get Justice Department officials to overturn the results of the 2020 election constitution an ""extraordinary circumstance"" and are not protected by executive privilege, the DOJ wrote in a letter this week. In the letter obtained by the New York Times, the DOJ advised officials who served in the Trump administration that they can give ""unrestricted testimony"" to committees investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, including the House panel that will meet for the first time Tuesday.

President Donald Trump’s administration has banned bump stocks, which effectively let semiautomatic weapons mimic machine guns. The administration’s final regulation, likely to officially publish on Friday, will bring bump stocks into the broader federal ban on machine guns starting in late March 2019, forcing people who own bump stocks today to turn in or destroy the devices within 90 days. The administration originally introduced the rule in March 2018, but it needed to go through a formal regulatory approval process to take effect. The bump stock ban originally came up in response to the Las Vegas shooting last year, in which a shooter used the devices to kill 58 people and injure hundreds more. The gunman still may have carried out the shooting without bump stocks, but the devices made the shooting much deadlier by turning his semiautomatic weapons into guns that closely simulated automatics. Automatic weapons are what many Americans think of as machine guns. They can continuously fire off a stream of bullets if the user simply holds down the trigger, making them very deadly. Semiautomatic weapons, by contrast, fire a single bullet per trigger pull. The difference between an automatic and a semiautomatic effectively translates to firing hundreds of rounds a minute versus dozens or so in the same time frame. Under federal law, fully automatic weapons are technically legal only if made before 1986, when Congress passed the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act. So it’s illegal to manufacture new automatic weapons for civilian use. Bump stocks offer a way around the law, as the Associated Press explained shortly after the Las Vegas shooting: The device basically replaces the gun’s shoulder rest, with a “support step” that covers the trigger opening. By holding the pistol grip with one hand and pushing forward on the barrel with the other, the shooter’s finger comes in contact with the trigger. The recoil causes the gun to buck back and forth, “bumping” the trigger. Technically, that means the finger is pulling the trigger for each round fired, keeping the weapon a legal semi-automatic. There are other modifications that achieve a similar effect, including a crank that replaces the trigger and turns a gun into what a gun aficionado channel on YouTube called “a mini Gatling Gun.” Shortly after the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting in February, Trump called on the Justice Department to ban bump stocks and similar devices (although the Parkland shooting did not involve a bump stock). The Justice Department’s decision to do so came despite a reluctance that the Justice Department or Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) have the legal authority ban bump stocks and similar devices. The new regulation will likely face challenges in court. But even if it survives, there’s a big question of just how effective the ban will be. The bump stock ban is among several proposals Trump has made to tighten gun control after the Florida shooting, such as improving reporting to the background check system and raising the legal age for purchasing assault-style weapons from 18 to 21. Even if all these efforts were successful, it’s unclear just how much of an effect they would have — because they do little to quickly address the core problem behind US gun violence. The US is unique in two key, and related, ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far more guns than any other country in the world. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) Mass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America’s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2016. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, “The US makes up less than 5% of the world’s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.” The US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey. Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms. These two facts — on gun deaths and firearm ownership — are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths. “Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health. For example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level. This chart, based on data from researcher Josh Tewksbury, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths among wealthier nations: Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry during an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone. Gun control measures can help address this by reducing the number of people who own guns, whether over time or immediately. The research supports gun control: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives. But not all gun control is made equal. Consider the specifics of the US: If the key problem is that America has too many guns, then it needs to do something to reduce the number of guns in circulation quickly — something akin to Australia’s response to a mass shooting in the late 1990s, when the country passed sweeping restrictions on firearms and enacted what was effectively a gun confiscation program for certain types of weapons. That policy not only cut the number of guns in circulation but, based on the research, may have cut the firearm homicide and suicide rates too. The policies Trump has backed wouldn’t achieve that. They could over time reduce the number of guns in circulation — by imposing barriers that future would-be buyers won’t be able to overcome — but they don’t do anything to immediately take guns out of circulation. In fact, this is typical in US policy responses to guns: After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26, the bill Congress considered (but didn’t pass) would not have implemented even universal background checks, and it certainly wouldn’t have created a mandatory buyback program like Australia’s. None of that is to say that milder measures aren’t effective. Connecticut’s law requiring handgun purchasers to first pass a background check and obtain a license, for example, was followed by a 40 percent drop in gun homicides and a 15 percent reduction in gun suicides. Similar results, in the reverse, were reported in Missouri when it repealed its own permit-to-purchase law. There’s similar evidence for Massachusetts’s gun license system. And a review of the evidence by RAND also linked milder gun control measures, including background checks, to reduced injuries and deaths — and that means these measures likely saved lives. But if America wants to get to the levels of gun deaths that its European peers report, it will likely need to go much further. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

384,https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/memorable-photos-2018/,"What makes some images memorable and others easily forgotten? It’s a question I’ve been studying for nearly 20 years. Estimates suggest that more than 1 trillion photos were taken in 2018. With so many in circulation, it’s difficult for any single photo to capture our attention and become a famed iconic image. In the golden age of photojournalism, news photographs became iconic largely because they appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world – think Iwo Jima and the Hindenburg. But that age has come to an end: Digital journalism and social media have changed the way we consume images. Each day, audiences are bombarded with photos. Many are shocking, inspiring and heartbreaking. But in their overwhelming volume, they’re easily forgotten. Nonetheless, some do rise to the top. Two colleagues and I developed a model to help predict when and how certain images may become widely known. The model shows that certain characteristics of an image – such as its timeliness, its cultural resonance, its political potency or its likelihood of being turned into a meme – can influence its rise and reach. Images that exhibit these qualities can quickly go viral, turning them into what communication scholars call “instant news icons.” While these images don’t typically endure to become truly historic, they nonetheless help citizens navigate and understand complex events. So which images did this in 2018? On Feb. 14, a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people and injuring 17 others. Following such a mass shooting, there’s a predictable pattern of news media coverage – breaking news reports filled with speculation, details about the perpetrator, elected officials responding with “thoughts and prayers” and debates about mental health and gun control. But after the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, we saw something new: images of resistance. The students there spoke fervently, demanding action from elected officials. These images of resistance spurred school walkouts and nationwide protests, culminating in the March For Our Lives. Forest fires continued to rage in 2018. During the devastating Carr Fire that burned more than 200,000 acres and claimed the lives of three firefighters, Redding, California resident Richard Tuggle captured a photo of five firefighters resting in a backyard in his neighborhood on July 27. The firefighters were clearly reeling from the exhaustion of battling the deadly fire.   Richard Tuggle/Facebook What’s particularly interesting about this photo and its rise to prominence is that it was captured by a citizen rather than a journalist. The photo went viral on social media and was ultimately picked up by news outlets across the country, showing how instant news icons can come from citizens as well as journalists in this new age of photography. Amid controversy and protests, the Senate narrowly confirmed Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court on Oct. 6. The contentious confirmation hearings pitted the image of an incensed Kavanaugh against images of impassioned protesters standing in solidarity with a calm, composed Christine Blasey Ford.   AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool   AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool In early October, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared. The Saudis initially denied that they had anything to do with his disappearance. But security-camera footage emerged showing Khashoggi entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. It served as evidence to support the claim – later confirmed – that he was killed inside.   CCTV/Hurriyet via AP In this case, the image was captured by a security camera, rather than a photographer. Nonetheless, it became an instant news icon. It’s just another example of the changing nature of the production and consumption of news imagery. Time magazine named journalists as their 2018 Person of the Year, partly in response to the Khashoggi killing. A devastating war in Yemen has led to economic instability and widespread food shortages. On Oct. 26, The New York Times published photojournalist Tyler Hicks’ gut-wrenching images of starving Yemeni children. A few days later we learned that Amal Hussain, the 7-year-old girl in Hicks’ haunting photo, had died. Journalists have continued to document this humanitarian crisis. In mid-December the Senate voted to end U.S. military support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen. But the crisis continues, and millions of people still face starvation. Political, economic and ethical debates about immigration dominated the year, with two photos driving the conversation. Getty photographer John Moore’s image of a 2-year-old Honduran girl in a pink shirt sobbing as U.S. Border Patrol agents searched her mother became the face of Trump’s “zero tolerance” family separation policy. The image was even modified for a Time magazine cover under the headline “Welcome to America.”   John Moore/Getty Images The image continued to spur discussion after it was made clear that the mother and daughter were not actually separated. However, hundreds of other children have been separated from their parents and recently a 7-year-old girl in Border Patrol custody died. Then, on Nov. 25, Reuters photojournalist Kim Kyung-Hoon snapped a picture of a mother and her twin daughters fleeing tear gas at the border wall between the U.S. and Tijuana, Mexico. Appearing in news outlets and on social media feeds across the country, it spurred further public and political outrage. Some said the photo effectively contradicted Trump’s narrative that refugees were dangerous. Others noted that the photo evoked the iconic image of a naked Vietnamese girl screaming in pain following a napalm attack.

I think it's a disgrace,"" she told ABC's George Stephanopoulos.    According to a report from Forbes, lawyers who brought lawsuits attacking the 2020 presidential election results in Michigan by alleging voter fraud are attempting to use Donald Trump's words to avoid sanctions. On the evening before House select committee opens hearings into the Jan 6th Capitol riot that was inspired by accusations that the election was stolen from Trump, the so-called ""Kraken"" attorneys, including one-time Trump attorney Sidney Powell, made a new filing.        Former president Donald Trump's alleged efforts to get Justice Department officials to overturn the results of the 2020 election constitution an ""extraordinary circumstance"" and are not protected by executive privilege, the DOJ wrote in a letter this week. In the letter obtained by the New York Times, the DOJ advised officials who served in the Trump administration that they can give ""unrestricted testimony"" to committees investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, including the House panel that will meet for the first time Tuesday.

By Patrick Radden Keefe “Expedition: Robinson,” a Swedish reality-television program, premièred in the summer of 1997, with a tantalizing premise: sixteen strangers are deposited on a small island off the coast of Malaysia and forced to fend for themselves. To survive, they must coöperate, but they are also competing: each week, a member of the ensemble is voted off the island, and the final contestant wins a grand prize. The show’s title alluded to both “Robinson Crusoe” and “The Swiss Family Robinson,” but a more apt literary reference might have been “Lord of the Flies.” The first contestant who was kicked off was a young man named Sinisa Savija. Upon returning to Sweden, he was morose, complaining to his wife that the show’s editors would “cut away the good things I did and make me look like a fool.” Nine weeks before the show aired, he stepped in front of a speeding train. The producers dealt with this tragedy by suggesting that Savija’s turmoil was unrelated to the series—and by editing him virtually out of the show. Even so, there was a backlash, with one critic asserting that a program based on such merciless competition was “fascist television.” But everyone watched the show anyway, and Savija was soon forgotten. “We had never seen anything like it,” Svante Stockselius, the chief of the network that produced the program, told the Los Angeles Times, in 2000. “Expedition: Robinson” offered a potent cocktail of repulsion and attraction. You felt embarrassed watching it, Stockselius said, but “you couldn’t stop.” In 1998, a thirty-eight-year-old former British paratrooper named Mark Burnett was living in Los Angeles, producing television. “Lord of the Flies” was one of his favorite books, and after he heard about “Expedition: Robinson” he secured the rights to make an American version. Burnett had previously worked in sales and had a knack for branding. He renamed the show “Survivor.” The first season was set in Borneo, and from the moment it aired, on CBS, in 2000, “Survivor” was a ratings juggernaut: according to the network, a hundred and twenty-five million Americans—more than a third of the population—tuned in for some portion of the season finale. The catchphrase delivered by the host, Jeff Probst, at the end of each elimination ceremony, “The tribe has spoken,” entered the lexicon. Burnett had been a marginal figure in Hollywood, but after this triumph he, too, was rebranded, as an oracle of spectacle. Les Moonves, then the chairman of CBS, arranged for the delivery of a token of thanks—a champagne-colored Mercedes. To Burnett, the meaning of this gesture was unmistakable: “I had arrived.” The only question was what he might do next. A few years later, Burnett was in Brazil, filming “Survivor: The Amazon.” His second marriage was falling apart, and he was staying in a corporate apartment with a girlfriend. One day, they were watching TV and happened across a BBC documentary series called “Trouble at the Top,” about the corporate rat race. The girlfriend found the show boring and suggested changing the station, but Burnett was transfixed. He called his business partner in L.A. and said, “I’ve got a new idea.” Burnett would not discuss the concept over the phone—one of his rules for success was to always pitch in person—but he was certain that the premise had the contours of a hit: “Survivor” in the city. Contestants competing for a corporate job. The urban jungle! He needed someone to play the role of heavyweight tycoon. Burnett, who tends to narrate stories from his own life in the bravura language of a Hollywood pitch, once said of the show, “It’s got to have a hook to it, right? They’ve got to be working for someone big and special and important. Cut to: I’ve rented this skating rink.” In 2002, Burnett rented Wollman Rink, in Central Park, for a live broadcast of the Season 4 finale of “Survivor.” The property was controlled by Donald Trump, who had obtained the lease to operate the rink in 1986, and had plastered his name on it. Before the segment started, Burnett addressed fifteen hundred spectators who had been corralled for the occasion, and noticed Trump sitting with Melania Knauss, then his girlfriend, in the front row. Burnett prides himself on his ability to “read the room”: to size up the personalities in his audience, suss out what they want, and then give it to them. “I need to show respect to Mr. Trump,” Burnett recounted, in a 2013 speech in Vancouver. “I said, ‘Welcome, everybody, to Trump Wollman skating rink. The Trump Wollman skating rink is a fine facility, built by Mr. Donald Trump. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Because the Trump Wollman skating rink is the place we are tonight and we love being at the Trump Wollman skating rink, Mr. Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.” As Burnett told the story, he had scarcely got offstage before Trump was shaking his hand, proclaiming, “You’re a genius!” Cut to: June, 2015. After starring in fourteen seasons of “The Apprentice,” all executive-produced by Burnett, Trump appeared in the gilded atrium of Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue, to announce that he was running for President. Only someone “really rich,” Trump declared, could “take the brand of the United States and make it great again.” He also made racist remarks about Mexicans, prompting NBC, which had broadcast “The Apprentice,” to fire him. Burnett, however, did not sever his relationship with his star. He and Trump had been equal partners in “The Apprentice,” and the show had made each of them hundreds of millions of dollars. They were also close friends: Burnett liked to tell people that when Trump married Knauss, in 2005, Burnett’s son Cameron was the ring bearer. Trump had been a celebrity since the eighties, his persona shaped by the best-selling book “The Art of the Deal.” But his business had foundered, and by 2003 he had become a garish figure of local interest—a punch line on Page Six. “The Apprentice” mythologized him anew, and on a much bigger scale, turning him into an icon of American success. Jay Bienstock, a longtime collaborator of Burnett’s, and the showrunner on “The Apprentice,” told me, “Mark always likes to compare his shows to great films or novels. All of Mark’s shows feel bigger than life, and this is by design.” Burnett has made many programs since “The Apprentice,” among them “Shark Tank,” a startup competition based on a Japanese show, and “The Voice,” a singing contest adapted from a Dutch program. In June, he became the chairman of M-G-M Television. But his chief legacy is to have cast a serially bankrupt carnival barker in the role of a man who might plausibly become the leader of the free world. “I don’t think any of us could have known what this would become,” Katherine Walker, a producer on the first five seasons of “The Apprentice,” told me. “But Donald would not be President had it not been for that show.” Tony Schwartz, who wrote “The Art of the Deal,” which falsely presented Trump as its primary author, told me that he feels some responsibility for facilitating Trump’s imposture. But, he said, “Mark Burnett’s influence was vastly greater,” adding, “ ‘The Apprentice’ was the single biggest factor in putting Trump in the national spotlight.” Schwartz has publicly condemned Trump, describing him as “the monster I helped to create.” Burnett, by contrast, has refused to speak publicly about his relationship with the President or about his curious, but decisive, role in American history. Burnett is lean and lanky, with the ageless, perpetually smiling face of Peter Pan and eyes that, in the words of one ex-wife, have “a Photoshop twinkle.” He has a high forehead and the fixed, gravity-defying hair of a nineteen-fifties film star. People often mistake Burnett for an Australian, because he has a deep tan and an outdoorsy disposition, and because his accent has been mongrelized by years of international travel. But he grew up in Dagenham, on the eastern outskirts of London, a milieu that he has recalled as “gray and grimy.” His father, Archie, was a tattooed Glaswegian who worked the night shift at a Ford automobile plant. His mother, Jean, worked there as well, pouring acid into batteries, but in Mark’s recollection she always dressed immaculately, “never letting her station in life interfere with how she presented herself.” Mark, an only child, grew up watching American television shows such as “Starsky & Hutch” and “The Rockford Files.” At seventeen, he volunteered for the British Army’s Parachute Regiment; according to a friend who enlisted with him, he joined for “the glitz.” The Paras were an élite unit, and a soldier from his platoon, Paul Read, told me that Burnett was a particularly formidable special operator, both physically commanding and a natural leader: “He was always super keen. He always wanted to be the best, even among the best.” (Another soldier recalled that Burnett was nicknamed the Male Model, because he was reluctant to “get any dirt under his fingernails.”) Burnett served in Northern Ireland, and then in the Falklands, where he took part in the 1982 advance on Port Stanley. The experience, he later said, was “horrific, but on the other hand—in a sick way—exciting.” When Burnett left the Army, after five years, his plan was to find work in Central America as a “weapons and tactics adviser”—not as a mercenary, he later insisted, though it is difficult to parse the distinction. Before he left, his mother told him that she’d had a premonition and implored him not to take another job that involved carrying a gun. Like Trump, Burnett trusts his impulses. “Your gut instinct is rarely wrong,” he likes to say. During a layover in Los Angeles, he decided to heed his mother’s admonition, and walked out of the airport. He later described himself as the quintessential immigrant: “I had no money, no green card, no nothing.” But the California sun was shining, and he was eager to try his luck. Burnett is an avid raconteur, and his anecdotes about his life tend to have a three-act structure. In Act I, he is a fish out of water, guileless and naïve, with nothing but the shirt on his back and an outsized dream. Act II is the rude awakening: the world bets against him. It’s impossible! You’ll lose everything! No such thing has ever been tried! In Act III, Burnett always prevails. Not long after arriving in California, he landed his first job—as a nanny. Eyebrows were raised: a commando turned nanny? Yet Burnett thrived, working for a family in Beverly Hills, then one in Malibu. As he later observed, the experience taught him “how nice the life styles of wealthy people are.” Young, handsome, and solicitous, he discovered that successful people are often happy to talk about their path to success. Burnett married a California woman, Kym Gold, who came from an affluent family. “Mark has always been very, very hungry,” Gold told me recently. “He’s always had a lot of drive.” For a time, he worked for Gold’s stepfather, who owned a casting agency, and for Gold, who owned an apparel business. She would buy slightly imperfect T-shirts wholesale, at two dollars apiece, and Burnett would resell them, on the Venice boardwalk, for eighteen. That was where he learned “the art of selling,” he has said. The marriage lasted only a year, by which point Burnett had obtained a green card. (Gold, who had also learned a thing or two about selling, went on to co-found the denim company True Religion, which was eventually sold for eight hundred million dollars.) One day in the early nineties, Burnett read an article about a new kind of athletic event: a long-distance endurance race, known as the Raid Gauloises, in which teams of athletes competed in a multiday trek over harsh terrain. In 1992, Burnett organized a team and participated in a race in Oman. Noticing that he and his teammates were “walking, climbing advertisements” for gear, he signed up sponsors. He also realized that if you filmed such a race it would make for exotic and gripping viewing. Burnett launched his own race, the Eco-Challenge, which was set in such scenic locations as Utah and British Columbia, and was televised on various outlets, including the Discovery Channel. Bienstock, who first met Burnett when he worked on the “Eco-Challenge” show, in 1996, told me that Burnett was less interested in the ravishing backdrops or in the competition than he was in the intense emotional experiences of the racers: “Mark saw the drama in real people being the driving force in an unscripted show.” By this time, Burnett had met an aspiring actress from Long Island named Dianne Minerva and married her. They became consumed with making the show a success. “When we went to bed at night, we talked about it, when we woke up in the morning, we talked about it,” Dianne Burnett told me recently. In the small world of adventure racing, Mark developed a reputation as a slick and ambitious operator. “He’s like a rattlesnake,” one of his business competitors told the New York Times in 2000. “If you’re close enough long enough, you’re going to get bit.” Mark and Dianne were doing far better than Mark’s parents ever had, but he was restless. One day, they attended a seminar by the motivational speaker Tony Robbins called “Unleash the Power Within.” A good technique for realizing your goals, Robbins counselled, was to write down what you wanted most on index cards, then deposit them around your house, as constant reminders. In a 2012 memoir, “The Road to Reality,” Dianne Burnett recalls that she wrote the word “FAMILY” on her index cards. Mark wrote “MORE MONEY.” As a young man, Burnett occasionally found himself on a flight for business, looking at the other passengers and daydreaming: If this plane were to crash on a desert island, where would I fit into our new society? Who would lead and who would follow? “Nature strips away the veneer we show one another every day, at which point people become who they really are,” Burnett once wrote. He has long espoused a Hobbesian world view, and when he launched “Survivor” a zero-sum ethos was integral to the show. “It’s quite a mean game, just like life is kind of a mean game,” Burnett told CNN, in 2001. “Everyone’s out for themselves.” On “Survivor,” the competitors were split into teams, or “tribes.” In this raw arena, Burnett suggested, viewers could glimpse the cruel essence of human nature. It was undeniably compelling to watch contestants of different ages, body types, and dispositions negotiate the primordial challenges of making fire, securing shelter, and foraging for food. At the same time, the scenario was extravagantly contrived: the castaways were shadowed by camera crews, and helicopters thundered around the island, gathering aerial shots. Moreover, the contestants had been selected for their charisma and their combustibility. “It’s all about casting,” Burnett once observed. “As a producer, my job is to make the choices in who to work with and put on camera.” He was always searching for someone with the sort of personality that could “break through the clutter.” In casting sessions, Burnett sometimes goaded people, to see how they responded to conflict. Katherine Walker, the “Apprentice” producer, told me about an audition in which Burnett taunted a prospective cast member by insinuating that he was secretly gay. (The man, riled, threw the accusation back at Burnett, and was not cast that season.) Richard Levak, a clinical psychologist who consulted for Burnett on “Survivor” and “The Apprentice” and worked on other reality-TV shows, told me that producers have often liked people he was uncomfortable with for psychological reasons. Emotional volatility makes for compelling television. But recruiting individuals for their instability and then subjecting them to the stress of a televised competition can be perilous. When Burnett was once asked about Sinisa Savija’s suicide, he contended that Savija had “previous psychological problems.” No “Survivor” or “Apprentice” contestants are known to have killed themselves, but in the past two decades several dozen reality-TV participants have. Levak eventually stopped consulting on such programs, in part because he feared that a contestant might harm himself. “I would think, Geez, if this should unravel, they’re going to look at the personality profile and there may have been a red flag,” he recalled. Burnett excelled at the casting equation to the point where, on Season 2 of “Survivor,” which was shot in the Australian outback, his castaways spent so much time gossiping about the characters from the previous season that Burnett warned them, “The more time you spend talking about the first ‘Survivor,’ the less time you will have on television.” But Burnett’s real genius was in marketing. When he made the rounds in L.A. to pitch “Survivor,” he vowed that it would become a cultural phenomenon, and he presented executives with a mock issue of Newsweek featuring the show on the cover. (Later, “Survivor” did make the cover of the magazine.) Burnett devised a dizzying array of lucrative product-integration deals. In the first season, one of the teams won a care package that was attached to a parachute bearing the red-and-white logo of Target. “I looked on ‘Survivor’ as much as a marketing vehicle as a television show,” Burnett once explained. He was creating an immersive, cinematic entertainment—and he was known for lush production values, and for paying handsomely to retain top producers and editors—but he was anything but precious about his art. Long before he met Trump, Burnett had developed a Panglossian confidence in the power of branding. “I believe we’re going to see something like the Microsoft Grand Canyon National Park,” he told the New York Times in 2001. “The government won’t take care of all that—companies will.” Seven weeks before the 2016 election, Burnett, in a smart tux with a shawl collar, arrived with his third wife, the actress and producer Roma Downey, at the Microsoft Theatre, in Los Angeles, for the Emmy Awards. Both “Shark Tank” and “The Voice” won awards that night. But his triumphant evening was marred when the master of ceremonies, Jimmy Kimmel, took an unexpected turn during his opening monologue. “Television brings people together, but television can also tear us apart,” Kimmel mused. “I mean, if it wasn’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for President?” In the crowd, there was laughter. “Many have asked, ‘Who is to blame for Donald Trump?’ ” Kimmel continued. “I’ll tell you who, because he’s sitting right there. That guy.” Kimmel pointed into the audience, and the live feed cut to a closeup of Burnett, whose expression resolved itself into a rigid grin. “Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one,” Kimmel said. Burnett was still smiling, but Kimmel wasn’t. He went on, “I’m going on the record right now. He’s responsible. If Donald Trump gets elected and he builds that wall, the first person we’re throwing over it is Mark Burnett. The tribe has spoken.” Around this time, Burnett stopped giving interviews about Trump or “The Apprentice.” He continues to speak to the press to promote his shows, but he declined an interview with me. Before Trump’s Presidential run, however, Burnett told and retold the story of how the show originated. When he met Trump at Wollman Rink, Burnett told him an anecdote about how, as a young man selling T-shirts on the boardwalk on Venice Beach, he had been handed a copy of “The Art of the Deal,” by a passing rollerblader. Burnett said that he had read it, and that it had changed his life; he thought, What a legend this guy Trump is! Anyone else hearing this tale might have found it a bit calculated, if not implausible. Kym Gold, Burnett’s first wife, told me that she has no recollection of him reading Trump’s book in this period. “He liked mystery books,” she said. But when Trump heard the story he was flattered. Burnett has never liked the phrase “reality television.” For a time, he valiantly campaigned to rebrand his genre “dramality”—“a mixture of drama and reality.” The term never caught on, but it reflected Burnett’s forthright acknowledgment that what he creates is a highly structured, selective, and manipulated rendition of reality. Burnett has often boasted that, for each televised hour of “The Apprentice,” his crews shot as many as three hundred hours of footage. The real alchemy of reality television is the editing—sifting through a compost heap of clips and piecing together an absorbing story. Jonathon Braun, an editor who started working with Burnett on “Survivor” and then worked on the first six seasons of “The Apprentice,” told me, “You don’t make anything up. But you accentuate things that you see as themes.” He readily conceded how distorting this process can be. Much of reality TV consists of reaction shots: one participant says something outrageous, and the camera cuts away to another participant rolling her eyes. Often, Braun said, editors lift an eye roll from an entirely different part of the conversation. “The Apprentice” was built around a weekly series of business challenges. At the end of each episode, Trump determined which competitor should be “fired.” But, as Braun explained, Trump was frequently unprepared for these sessions, with little grasp of who had performed well. Sometimes a candidate distinguished herself during the contest only to get fired, on a whim, by Trump. When this happened, Braun said, the editors were often obliged to “reverse engineer” the episode, scouring hundreds of hours of footage to emphasize the few moments when the exemplary candidate might have slipped up, in an attempt to assemble an artificial version of history in which Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip decision made sense. During the making of “The Apprentice,” Burnett conceded that the stories were constructed in this way, saying, “We know each week who has been fired, and, therefore, you’re editing in reverse.” Braun noted that President Trump’s staff seems to have been similarly forced to learn the art of retroactive narrative construction, adding, “I find it strangely validating to hear that they’re doing the same thing in the White House.” Such sleight of hand is the industry standard in reality television. But the entire premise of “The Apprentice” was also something of a con. When Trump and Burnett told the story of their partnership, both suggested that Trump was initially wary of committing to a TV show, because he was so busy running his flourishing real-estate empire. During a 2004 panel at the Museum of Television and Radio, in Los Angeles, Trump claimed that “every network” had tried to get him to do a reality show, but he wasn’t interested: “I don’t want to have cameras all over my office, dealing with contractors, politicians, mobsters, and everyone else I have to deal with in my business. You know, mobsters don’t like, as they’re talking to me, having cameras all over the room. It would play well on television, but it doesn’t play well with them.” “The Apprentice” portrayed Trump not as a skeezy hustler who huddles with local mobsters but as a plutocrat with impeccable business instincts and unparalleled wealth—a titan who always seemed to be climbing out of helicopters or into limousines. “Most of us knew he was a fake,” Braun told me. “He had just gone through I don’t know how many bankruptcies. But we made him out to be the most important person in the world. It was like making the court jester the king.” Bill Pruitt, another producer, recalled, “We walked through the offices and saw chipped furniture. We saw a crumbling empire at every turn. Our job was to make it seem otherwise.” Trump maximized his profits from the start. When producers were searching for office space in which to stage the show, he vetoed every suggestion, then mentioned that he had an empty floor available in Trump Tower, which he could lease at a reasonable price. (After becoming President, he offered a similar arrangement to the Secret Service.) When the production staff tried to furnish the space, they found that local venders, stiffed by Trump in the past, refused to do business with them. More than two hundred thousand people applied for one of the sixteen spots on Season 1, and throughout the show’s early years the candidates were conspicuously credentialled and impressive. Officially, the grand prize was what the show described as “the dream job of a lifetime”—the unfathomable privilege of being mentored by Donald Trump while working as a junior executive at the Trump Organization. All the candidates paid lip service to the notion that Trump was a peerless businessman, but not all of them believed it. A standout contestant in Season 1 was Kwame Jackson, a young African-American man with an M.B.A. from Harvard, who had worked at Goldman Sachs. Jackson told me that he did the show not out of any desire for Trump’s tutelage but because he regarded the prospect of a nationally televised business competition as “a great platform” for career advancement. “At Goldman, I was in private-wealth management, so Trump was not, by any stretch, the most financially successful person I’d ever met or managed,” Jackson told me. He was quietly amused when other contestants swooned over Trump’s deal-making prowess or his elevated tastes—when they exclaimed, on tours of tacky Trump properties, “Oh, my God, this is so rich—this is, like, really rich!” Fran Lebowitz once remarked that Trump is “a poor person’s idea of a rich person,” and Jackson was struck, when the show aired, by the extent to which Americans fell for the ruse. “Main Street America saw all those glittery things, the helicopter and the gold-plated sinks, and saw the most successful person in the universe,” he recalled. “The people I knew in the world of high finance understood that it was all a joke.” This is an oddly common refrain among people who were involved in “The Apprentice”: that the show was camp, and that the image of Trump as an avatar of prosperity was delivered with a wink. Somehow, this interpretation eluded the audience. Jonathon Braun marvelled, “People started taking it seriously!” When I watched several dozen episodes of the show recently, I saw no hint of deliberate irony. Admittedly, it is laughable to hear the candidates, at a fancy meal, talk about watching Trump for cues on which utensil they should use for each course, as if he were Emily Post. But the show’s reverence for its pugnacious host, however credulous it might seem now, comes across as sincere. Did Burnett believe what he was selling? Or was Trump another two-dollar T-shirt that he pawned off for eighteen? It’s difficult to say. One person who has collaborated with Burnett likened him to Harold Hill, the travelling fraudster in “The Music Man,” saying, “There’s always an angle with Mark. He’s all about selling.” Burnett is fluent in the jargon of self-help, and he has published two memoirs, both written with Bill O’Reilly’s ghostwriter, which double as manuals on how to get rich. One of them, titled “Jump In!: Even if You Don’t Know How to Swim,” now reads like an inadvertent metaphor for the Trump Presidency. “Don’t waste time on overpreparation,” the book advises. At the 2004 panel, Burnett made it clear that, with “The Apprentice,” he was selling an archetype. “Donald is the real current-day version of a tycoon,” he said. “Donald will say whatever Donald wants to say. He takes no prisoners. If you’re Donald’s friend, he’ll defend you all day long. If you’re not, he’s going to kill you. And that’s very American. It’s like the guys who built the West.” Like Trump, Burnett seemed to have both a jaundiced impression of the gullible essence of the American people and a brazen enthusiasm for how to exploit it. “The Apprentice” was about “what makes America great,” Burnett said. “Everybody wants one of a few things in this country. They’re willing to pay to lose weight. They’re willing to pay to grow hair. They’re willing to pay to have sex. And they’re willing to pay to learn how to get rich.” At the start of “The Apprentice,” Burnett’s intention may have been to tell a more honest story, one that acknowledged Trump’s many stumbles. Burnett surely recognized that Trump was at a low point, but, according to Walker, “Mark sensed Trump’s potential for a comeback.” Indeed, in a voice-over introduction in the show’s pilot, Trump conceded a degree of weakness that feels shockingly self-aware when you listen to it today: “I was seriously in trouble. I was billions of dollars in debt. But I fought back, and I won, big league.” The show was an instant hit, and Trump’s public image, and the man himself, began to change. Not long after the première, Trump suggested in an Esquire article that people now liked him, “whereas before, they viewed me as a bit of an ogre.” Jim Dowd, Trump’s former publicist, told Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, the authors of the 2016 book “Trump Revealed,” that after “The Apprentice” began airing “people on the street embraced him.” Dowd noted, “All of a sudden, there was none of the old mocking,” adding, “He was a hero.” Dowd, who died in 2016, pinpointed the public’s embrace of “The Apprentice” as “the bridge” to Trump’s Presidential run. The show’s camera operators often shot Trump from low angles, as you would a basketball pro, or Mt. Rushmore. Trump loomed over the viewer, his face in a jowly glower, his hair darker than it is now, the metallic auburn of a new penny. (“Apprentice” employees were instructed not to fiddle with Trump’s hair, which he dyed and styled himself.) Trump’s entrances were choreographed for maximum impact, and often set to a moody accompaniment of synthesized drums and cymbals. The “boardroom”—a stage set where Trump determined which candidate should be fired—had the menacing gloom of a “Godfather” movie. In one scene, Trump ushered contestants through his rococo Trump Tower aerie, and said, “I show this apartment to very few people. Presidents. Kings.” In the tabloid ecosystem in which he had long languished, Trump was always Donald, or the Donald. On “The Apprentice,” he finally became Mr. Trump. “We have to subscribe to our own myths,” the “Apprentice” producer Bill Pruitt told me. “Mark Burnett is a great mythmaker. He blew up that balloon and he believed in it.” Burnett, preferring to spend time pitching new ideas for shows, delegated most of the daily decisions about “The Apprentice” to his team, many of them veterans of “Survivor” and “Eco-Challenge.” But he furiously promoted the show, often with Trump at his side. According to many of Burnett’s collaborators, one of his greatest skills is his handling of talent—understanding their desires and anxieties, making them feel protected and secure. On interview tours with Trump, Burnett exhibited the studied instincts of a veteran producer: anytime the spotlight strayed in his direction, he subtly redirected it at Trump. Burnett, who was forty-three when Season 1 aired, described the fifty-seven-year-old Trump as his “soul mate.” He expressed astonishment at Trump’s “laser-like focus and retention.” He delivered flattery in the ostentatiously obsequious register that Trump prefers. Burnett said he hoped that he might someday rise to Trump’s “level” of prestige and success, adding, “I don’t know if I’ll ever make it. But you know something? If you’re not shooting for the stars, you’re not shooting!” On one occasion, Trump invited Burnett to dinner at his Trump Tower apartment; Burnett had anticipated an elegant meal, and, according to an associate, concealed his surprise when Trump handed him a burger from McDonald’s. Trump liked to suggest that he and Burnett had come up with the show “together”; Burnett never corrected him. When Carolyn Kepcher, a Trump Organization executive who appeared alongside Trump in early seasons of “The Apprentice,” seemed to be courting her own celebrity, Trump fired her and gave on-air roles to three of his children, Ivanka, Donald, Jr., and Eric. Burnett grasped that the best way to keep Trump satisfied was to insure that he never felt upstaged. “It’s Batman and Robin, and I’m clearly Robin,” he said. Burnett sometimes went so far as to imply that Trump’s involvement in “The Apprentice” was a form of altruism. “This is Donald Trump giving back,” he told the Times in 2003, then offered a vague invocation of post-9/11 civic duty: “What makes the world a safe place right now? I think it’s American dollars, which come from taxes, which come because of Donald Trump.” Trump himself had been candid about his reasons for doing the show. “My jet’s going to be in every episode,” he told Jim Dowd, adding that the production would be “great for my brand.” It was. Season 1 of “The Apprentice” flogged one Trump property after another. The contestants stayed at Trump Tower, did events at Trump National Golf Club, sold Trump Ice bottled water. “I’ve always felt that the Trump Taj Mahal should do even better,” Trump announced before sending the contestants off on a challenge to lure gamblers to his Atlantic City casino, which soon went bankrupt. The prize for the winning team was an opportunity to stay and gamble at the Taj, trailed by cameras. “The Apprentice” was so successful that, by the time the second season launched, Trump’s lacklustre tie-in products were being edged out by blue-chip companies willing to pay handsomely to have their wares featured onscreen. In 2004, Kevin Harris, a producer who helped Burnett secure product-integration deals, sent an e-mail describing a teaser reel of Trump endorsements that would be used to attract clients: “Fast cutting of Donald—‘Crest is the biggest’ ‘I have worn Levis since I was 2’ ‘I love M&Ms’ ‘Unilever is the biggest company in the world’ all with the MONEY MONEY MONEY song over the top.” Burnett and Trump negotiated with NBC to retain the rights to income derived from product integration, and split the fees. On set, Trump often gloated about this easy money. One producer remembered, “You’d say, ‘Hey, Donald, today we have Pepsi, and they’re paying three million to be in the show,’ and he’d say, ‘That’s great, I just made a million five!’ ” Originally, Burnett had planned to cast a different mogul in the role of host each season. But Trump took to his part more nimbly than anyone might have predicted. He wouldn’t read a script—he stumbled over the words and got the enunciation all wrong. But off the cuff he delivered the kind of zesty banter that is the lifeblood of reality television. He barked at one contestant, “Sam, you’re sort of a disaster. Don’t take offense, but everyone hates you.” Katherine Walker told me that producers often struggled to make Trump seem coherent, editing out garbled syntax and malapropisms. “We cleaned it up so that he was his best self,” she said, adding, “I’m sure Donald thinks that he was never edited.” However, she acknowledged, he was a natural for the medium: whereas reality-TV producers generally must amp up personalities and events, to accentuate conflict and conjure intrigue, “we didn’t have to change him—he gave us stuff to work with.” Trump improvised the tagline for which “The Apprentice” became famous: “You’re fired.” NBC executives were so enamored of their new star that they instructed Burnett and his producers to give Trump more screen time. This is when Trump’s obsession with television ratings took hold. “I didn’t know what demographics was four weeks ago,” he told Larry King. “All of a sudden, I heard we were No. 3 in demographics. Last night, we were No. 1 in demographics. And that’s the important rating.” The ratings kept rising, and the first season’s finale was the No. 1 show of the week. For Burnett, Trump’s rehabilitation was a satisfying confirmation of a populist aesthetic. “I like it when critics slam a movie and it does massive box office,” he once said. “I love it.” Whereas others had seen in Trump only a tattered celebrity of the eighties, Burnett had glimpsed a feral charisma. On June 26, 2018, the day the Supreme Court upheld President Trump’s travel ban targeting people from several predominantly Muslim countries, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent out invitations to an event called a Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. If Pompeo registered any dissonance between such lofty rhetoric and Administration policies targeting certain religions, he didn’t mention it. The event took place the next month, at the State Department, in Washington, D.C., and one of the featured speakers was Mark Burnett. In 2004, he had been getting his hair cut at a salon in Malibu when he noticed an attractive woman getting a pedicure. It was Roma Downey, the star of “Touched by an Angel,” a long-running inspirational drama on CBS. They fell in love, and married in 2007; together, they helped rear Burnett’s two sons from his second marriage and Downey’s daughter. Downey, who grew up in a Catholic family in Northern Ireland, is deeply religious, and eventually Burnett, too, reoriented his life around Christianity. “Faith is a major part of our marriage,” Downey said, in 2013, adding, “We pray together.” For people who had long known Burnett, it was an unexpected turn. This was a man who had ended his second marriage during a live interview with Howard Stern. To promote “Survivor” in 2002, Burnett called in to Stern’s radio show, and Stern asked casually if he was married. When Burnett hesitated, Stern pounced. “You didn’t survive marriage?” he asked. “You don’t want your girlfriend to know you’re married?” As Burnett dissembled, Stern kept prying, and the exchange became excruciating. Finally, Stern asked if Burnett was “a single guy,” and Burnett replied, “You know? Yeah.” This was news to Dianne, Burnett’s wife of a decade. As she subsequently wrote in her memoir, “The 18-to-34 radio demographic knew where my marriage was headed before I did.” In 2008, Burnett’s longtime business partner, a lawyer named Conrad Riggs, filed a lawsuit alleging that Burnett had stiffed him to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. According to the lawsuit, the two men had made an agreement before “Survivor” and “The Apprentice” that Riggs would own ten per cent of Burnett’s company. When Riggs got married, someone who attended the ceremony told me, Burnett was his best man, and gave a speech saying that his success would have been impossible without Riggs. Several years later, when Burnett’s company was worth half a billion dollars, he denied having made any agreement. The suit settled out of court. (Riggs declined to comment.) Years ago, Burnett told Esquire that religion was “a waste of time.” Dianne Burnett told me that when she was married to him he had no interest in faith. “But you know what? People change,” she continued. “So I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt.” When Burnett met Downey, he reinvented himself. Having made a fortune producing television that was often exploitative, he announced that he would now focus exclusively on “family-friendly franchises,” declaring, “You don’t need to be mean to create drama.” Burnett and Downey launched a production company that has specialized in Christian-themed programming, including a hundred-million-dollar remake of “Ben-Hur,” which flopped. Burnett has spoken enthusiastically to colleagues about the role that prayer and religious devotion now play in his life. He and Downey describe themselves as “the noisiest Christians in Hollywood.” Kym Gold told me she thinks that Burnett tends to adapt to his current partner. Before he married Gold, who is Jewish, he took a six-week course in Judaism. “I’ve never known Mark to be religious,” Gold observed. But she noted that “people close to him have said, ‘He follows the wind.’ ” Rick Warren, the evangelical pastor, is a friend of Burnett’s. “Mark is not at all the person he was a decade ago,” he told me. “Hollywood is built on money, sex, power, and fame. I would say that none of those things are driving forces for him anymore.” Warren assured me, unprompted, that Burnett is sincere in his Christianity—that he is a “genuine believer” who has committed to being an “ambassador” for his faith. Others who know Burnett noted to me that the Christian community is itself a significant viewer demographic. Burnett talks with colleagues about the “faith audience,” and describes the Christian community as “the largest army on earth.” In 2013, he and Downey produced “The Bible,” a History Channel miniseries that, Burnett claims, was watched by a hundred million people. The Good Book, in Burnett’s words, is “the ultimate period piece.” At the State Department, Burnett mentioned religious intolerance “throughout the Middle East,” genocide in Darfur, and the persecution of religious minorities in Myanmar. “I’m simply a TV producer,” he said, noting that he was “far less educated” than his audience. But he was good at communicating with the masses, he went on. He explained his formula for storytelling: “K-I-S-S—‘Keep it simple, stupid.’ ” Burnett said that when he and Downey travel, strangers sometimes “ask her to lay her hands upon them,” as if she were actually an angel. This, he confided, is “the power of media.” He suggested that his position in Hollywood gave him some leverage when it came to pressing politicians to do the right thing: “In the end, nobody wants to look bad in the media.” But Burnett did not cite any controversial White House policies that he hoped to change; he didn’t even mention Trump’s name. Burnett had remained close to the President. At the National Prayer Breakfast in 2017, he introduced Trump, saying that there “has never been a single bad word between us,” and describing their fourteen-year friendship as “one of the greatest relationships of my life.” Over the years, Burnett and Downey have given to Democratic causes, and in 2008 they donated the maximum contribution to Barack Obama’s campaign. But Burnett has never been especially political. One longtime “Apprentice” staff member told me that Burnett did not welcome the idea of losing his star to a Presidential campaign, noting, “Trump running for President cost Mark a lot of money. He made millions on ‘The Apprentice,’ and Trump killed the franchise.” By the time Trump announced his campaign, ratings for “The Apprentice” had fallen, and the show had been repackaged as “The Celebrity Apprentice.” The contestants were now D-list celebrities, including Gary Busey, the zonked-out actor, and Gene Simmons, the repellent front man of Kiss. There were the same business challenges and boardroom eliminations, but the stakes felt conspicuously lower. A lot of the drama in the original “Apprentice” had stemmed from the idea that, for aspiring entrepreneurs, competing on the show could be a career-defining opportunity. For the aging, Botoxed cohort on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” their presence was a tacit admission that their best days were behind them. Still, everyone gamely pretended to take it seriously. Describing the show in one public appearance, Donald Trump, Jr., said that it could be intimidating for Trump’s children to pass judgment on someone “as accomplished as a Gene Simmons.” In the opening episode of Season 11, the theatrical tension of the boardroom was suddenly punctured by an electronic trill. “Whose cell phone?” Trump growled. “How do I turn this off?” Busey stuttered, fumbling with the tiny buttons. “Gary, turn your cell phone off!” Trump said. It is strange to watch this kind of malarkey now and consider that only a few years later one of these men would be President. “Donald mentioned a number of times, ‘Maybe I’ll run for President one day,’ ” Burnett told the Washington Post in January, 2016. “And sad to say, politics is kind of a TV show.” When Burnett was asked whether he supported Trump’s candidacy, he deflected the question, retreating behind his conceit that politics is simply entertainment by other means. “I have no idea about the politics,” he said, adding, “I have had great fun—great fun—watching it.” After Trump won the election, he turned to his old friend for advice on the inaugural festivities. Like a starlet who keeps returning to a favorite director, Trump had always loved the way that Burnett made him look. Burnett was summoned to New York for a consultation with the President-elect and another Trump confidant, the financier Tom Barrack. Burnett pitched a few Riefenstahlian notions: a parade up Fifth Avenue; a televised helicopter ride ushering Trump from Manhattan to D.C. Barrack, who became the chairman of the inaugural committee, later said that Burnett was actively involved in producing the Inauguration, adding, “Mark is a genius, and the President-elect loves him.” I spoke to several people who recalled Burnett telling them that he was busy working on the Inauguration. A Democratic political operative who was involved in a back-channel campaign to dissuade big-name stars from appearing at the event told me that Burnett had tried to enlist musicians to perform. “Mark was somebody we were actively working against,” the operative said. Trump’s wish list included Elton John, Aretha Franklin, and Paul Anka—who, he hoped, would sing “My Way”—but they all claimed to be otherwise engaged. The event ended up with sparse crowds and a feeble roster of performers. Burnett eventually played down his role in the Inauguration. His representatives told me that “he did not produce” the event. One person who knows Burnett pointed out, “It wasn’t successful, so he probably doesn’t want to be associated with it.” On October 8, 2016, the day after the Washington Post released the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump was caught on a hot mike bantering about grabbing women’s crotches, Bill Pruitt tweeted, “As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse.” In other interviews, Pruitt said that, during his time on “The Apprentice,” he’d heard Trump make not only sexist statements but also racist ones. This was not so difficult to imagine. Trump’s natural idiom is vulgarity, and the targets of his ire—Colin Kaepernick, “shithole countries,” any African-American journalist who asks him a tough question—are clearly not chosen at random. Part of what was mesmerizing about him, to Mark Burnett and, ultimately, to the American people, was his compulsion for offensive talk. But, in the heightened political atmosphere of an impending Trump Presidency, the notional existence of more “Trump tapes” assumed a potent urgency. Last summer, Omarosa Manigault Newman, the former “Apprentice” contestant and aide to the President, reignited such speculations when she claimed to have heard a tape, recorded during the period when “The Apprentice” was made, in which Trump said the N-word. Manigault Newman produced a recording of her own, taken surreptitiously, of a conversation with two aides from the Trump campaign, in which they appeared to discuss the existence of such a tape. On the recording, one of the aides, Lynne Patton, says that she raised the issue with Trump, and that he said he had no recollection of using such language. “No, he said it,” Katrina Pierson, the other aide, interjects. “He’s embarrassed.” On August 13, 2018, Trump denied that he had ever used racial slurs, tweeting, “@MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa.” This was a peculiar thing to tweet: if Trump had never uttered the epithet, why would he need to be assured by Burnett that there were no tapes of him doing so? The tweet was also notable because, when the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked, Burnett had taken his most definitive step toward distancing himself from Trump. In a statement, he had said, “Given all of the false media reports, I feel compelled to clarify a few points. I am not now and have never been a supporter of Donald Trump’s candidacy. I am NOT ‘Pro-Trump.’ Further, my wife and I reject the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign.” Trump generally answers such criticism with a hyperventilating rebuttal, but he didn’t fire back at Burnett—at least not publicly—and their friendship does not appear to have suffered. Scarcely two months after issuing his statement about not being “Pro-Trump,” Burnett attended a fund-raiser for the President-elect at Cipriani, in New York, and in January, 2017, he and his two sons flew to Washington for the Inauguration. Burnett may have wanted to downplay his friendship with the President, but Trump felt no similar compunction. Last March, at a rally in Richfield, Ohio, he announced, “I got a call from Mark Burnett! He did ‘The Apprentice,’ he’s a great guy. He said, ‘Donald, I called just to say hello and to tell you, did you see Roseanne’s ratings?’ ” (Roseanne Barr, a rare Trump supporter in Hollywood, had just rebooted her sitcom.) “I said, ‘Mark, how big were they?’ ‘They were unbelievable! Over eighteen million people!’ ” When I asked Burnett’s representatives about the President’s characterizations of his exchanges with Burnett, they declined to either confirm or deny their accuracy. Burnett’s reluctance to discuss the Trump Presidency is dismaying to many people involved with “The Apprentice,” given that Trump has succeeded in politics, in part, by borrowing the tropes of the show. Jonathon Braun pointed out to me that when Trump announced his candidacy, in 2015, he did so in the atrium of Trump Tower, and made his entrance by descending the gold-colored escalator—choreography that Burnett and his team had repeatedly used on the show. After Trump’s announcement, reports suggested that people who had filled the space and cheered during his speech had been hired to do so, like TV extras, for a day rate of fifty dollars. Earlier this year, the White House started issuing brief video monologues from the President that strongly evoke his appearances on Burnett’s show. Justin McConney, a former director of new media for the Trump Organization, told New York that, whenever Trump works with camera people, he instructs them, “Shoot me like I’m shot on ‘The Apprentice.’ ” Randal Pinkett, who won Season 4 of “The Apprentice,” told me that he had watched Trump’s campaign with a growing sense of dread. Pinkett had long since concluded that Trump was racist. When Trump named Pinkett, who is African-American, the winner, he asked him if he would consider sharing the title with another contestant, a white woman. Pinkett declined. “The only conclusion I can draw is that he didn’t want to see a black man be the sole winner of his show,” he told me. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen said Trump told him that he had not chosen Kwame Jackson, the Goldman Sachs banker, to win in Season 1, because “there’s no way I can let this black fag win.” As a winner, Pinkett went to work for the Trump Organization. “The closer I got to Donald, the less I liked what I saw,” he recalled. “It’s like a person with bad breath.” After Pennsylvania legalized casino gambling, in 2004, Trump applied for a license to build a casino in a predominantly African-American community. “The community hated Donald,” Pinkett said. So the company dispatched Pinkett as an advocate. Upon returning, he said, “I’m not going out there again to represent you folks.” The Trump Organization was using him like a prop, he felt, and he did not want to sell a project that the community so roundly opposed. The casino was never built. Even the grand prize on “The Apprentice” was a bit of a fake, Pinkett told me. His Trump Organization job was actually paid for by NBC. “It wasn’t even his money!” he said. When Trump announced his campaign, Pinkett and Kwame Jackson decided to make a public statement opposing him. “This wasn’t about policy or politics, this was about fitness for office,” Jackson recalled. “This was about basic American character and decency.” They reached out to scores of former contestants and planned a press conference. In the end, apart from Pinkett, Jackson, and two other contestants, nobody showed up. In a statement, Trump said, “How quickly they forget. Nobody would know who they are if it weren’t for me.” “I think the reality for Mark Burnett is he’s a Hollywood guy,” Jackson told me. “He probably feels that if he torpedoes Donald Trump he’ll torpedo a part of his own legacy. And it’s funny, because he has enough money and enough power in Hollywood that he could actually afford to speak up.” Burnett’s silence “is abdication,” Jackson said. “It’s collusion. It’s being complicit, just like an Ivanka Trump. I’m very disappointed in Mark for that.” A recent piece in the Ankler, a widely read online newsletter about Hollywood, noted that Burnett “has spent the past couple years reigning over his corner of resistance territory with nary the slightest hint of backlash.” Donald Trump was a folk devil in Hollywood, and everyone in the industry knew about Burnett’s close association with the President, yet no prominent liberals were refusing to work with Mark Burnett. It’s one thing to “take brave stands on the red carpet,” the article observed. “But you wouldn’t want to go so crazy as to . . . get on the wrong side of a mid-sized mini-studio.” Burnett was recruited to the television arm of M-G-M in 2015, by Gary Barber, the company’s chairman and C.E.O. Barber, a former accountant, had brought the studio back from bankruptcy, slashing costs and shepherding profitable titles like the James Bond franchise. In his effort to build up M-G-M, Barber wanted to augment the studio’s television business. So he bought Burnett’s company and enlisted him to oversee television production. Ostensibly, Barber and Burnett got along. But, whereas Mark Burnett Productions had been characterized by profligate dazzle, Barber was thrifty, and monitored every expense. The chairman of M-G-M’s board is Kevin Ulrich, a financier whose private-equity fund holds a controlling stake in the company. People who know Ulrich describe him as someone who relishes the flashy perquisites of Hollywood moguldom. Whereas Barber liked to spend weekends quietly tending to the racehorses he owns, Ulrich liked going to parties and premières. Barber was interested in selling the studio—a move that Ulrich opposed. According to several sources, Burnett began cultivating Ulrich, inviting him to events and introducing him to celebrities. Then, last March, M-G-M’s board informed Barber that he had been fired; he had just signed a contract extension, so the studio would pay him two hundred and sixty million dollars to leave. Despite this payment, he was incensed. Three months after Barber’s ouster, Burnett was promoted to chairman of television at M-G-M. Barber declined to speak with me, but a friend of his said that he was “blindsided” by his ouster: Burnett had made an alliance with Ulrich and got Barber kicked off the island. As a younger man, Burnett made it known that he wasn’t content to be the producer of a few hit shows—he wanted to run a television studio one day. According to someone who has worked closely with him, Burnett had always felt like an outsider, “because in the reality-TV business, you’re never part of the true Hollywood.” He had long aspired to transition to scripted television and films but did not have much talent for such storytelling. At M-G-M, he would oversee both scripted and unscripted shows, including the acclaimed series “Fargo” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” He had now achieved such a level of power that, even in reflexively liberal Hollywood, his association with Trump was discussed mostly in whispers. Many people who spoke to me for this piece would not do so on the record, citing fears of being blacklisted. Nevertheless, “The Apprentice” continues to dog Burnett. In 2017, when he took the stage at the Producers Guild of America Awards to accept the award for Outstanding Producer of Competition Television, there were boos in the audience. In September, he skipped the Emmy Awards, though “The Voice” and “Shark Tank” were nominated; the night before the ceremony, however, he and Downey attended the annual gala for the Motion Picture & Television Fund, at a hotel in Century City. Walking into the event, they had a confrontation with the actor Tom Arnold. Arnold, a wild-eyed industry veteran best known for his role in the 1994 film “True Lies” and for a former marriage to Roseanne Barr, had been on a quest to uncover damaging “Apprentice” outtakes of Donald Trump. He had even launched a gonzo TV show, produced by Vice, called “The Hunt for the Trump Tapes.” As Arnold relates on the show, he and Trump knew each other for years, because they had occupied “the same level of Hollywood.” Indeed, in 2010, Burnett had e-mailed Arnold, “Is there any way I can get you to do Celeb Apprentice? . . . I do think that Celeb Apprentice has an awesome brand. Trump really wants you. I REALLY want you.” Arnold was, in his own estimation, a prankster and a marginal celebrity. And it disturbed him to think that someone just like him might be entrusted with managing the country. What precisely happened in Century City is a matter of dispute, but there was a scuffle between Arnold and Burnett. Soon afterward, Roma Downey tweeted a photograph of the back of her hand, writing, “Got this bruise tonight when Tom Arnold tried to ambush my husband Mark and me at a charity event. Is your TV show worth it Tom? Please stop.” Some observers wondered whether a bruise could have emerged that quickly. Arnold himself offered a very different account on Twitter: “Mark Burnett just went apeshit & choked me at this huge Emmy party then he ran away with his torn Pink shirt & missing gold chain. I’m waiting for LAPD.” It might seem improbable that Burnett, the smiling glad-hander, would physically attack someone. But it would not be unprecedented. His second wife, Dianne Burnett, told me that one day, in Santa Monica, Mark left her and one of their sons in the car in order to fetch frozen yogurt. While he was gone, a vagrant began aggressively banging on the car window, presumably in search of a donation. When Burnett returned, Dianne recalled, he punched the man in the face, knocking him down, then drove away. Hours after the Century City event, TMZ published an account by an eyewitness, who said that “Mark had his hands on Tom’s throat, and Tom was tearing at Mark’s shirt and ripping off his crucifix.” The authorities have declined to press charges against Burnett, and several people close to him characterized Arnold as a puerile stunt artist who cornered Burnett in a bit of performance art in order to promote his lousy show. That may well be true, but there is a certain cosmic poetry in the notion that the only person in Hollywood willing to antagonize Burnett about his relationship with Trump is a figure like Tom Arnold. Someone who has worked with Burnett told me, “Mark created the world in which Tom Arnold is the only guy who can go after him. Tom Arnold is trolling Mark Burnett just like Donald Trump trolled all his opponents. And he’s doing it for a reality show!” After Season 1 of “Survivor,” a contestant named Stacey Stillman sued CBS and Burnett, claiming that he had improperly shaped the competition by whispering to contestants about whom they should vote to eliminate. In a deposition, another cast member said that Burnett “believed that certain people would make a better TV show than others, and he did what he could to have influence over those people staying on the island.” Burnett denied any wrongdoing, and the suit was ultimately settled. One consequence of the lawsuit was that, when it came time to make “The Apprentice,” producers tried to have cameras on Donald Trump from the moment he walked onto the set until the moment he left—and all that footage was preserved. When M-G-M bought Burnett’s company, it assumed ownership of those outtakes and, after the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked, it had to contend with public demands to unseal the “Apprentice” tapes. Marvin Putnam, a lawyer who represents M-G-M, told me, “Mark Burnett cannot release the tapes. Period. Even if Mark Burnett wanted to release the tapes, Mark Burnett cannot release the tapes.” Putnam explained that the contracts that Trump and other cast members signed contained standard industry stipulations limiting the manner in which outtakes and other footage could be used. These are binding obligations, which means that if M-G-M were to violate them—by releasing footage not just of Trump but of anyone who appeared with him onscreen—the studio could be sued. Brian Edwards, the president of television operations at M-G-M, who has worked with Burnett for more than a decade, pointed out that, even without such legal constraints, Burnett couldn’t release the tapes—if he did, talent would refuse to work with him in the future. “If everybody in reality television knew that their outtakes were going to be made public at the first sign of pressure, what do you think would happen to the business?” Edwards asked. Neither Putnam nor Edwards would comment on whether M-G-M possesses tapes in which Trump says something offensive; nor would they say how much, if any, of the archive has been reviewed. Over the fourteen seasons hosted by Trump, nearly two hundred hours of “The Apprentice” aired on NBC. If Burnett indeed shot three hundred hours of footage for each episode, there could be some sixty thousand hours of outtakes to sift through. Most of the former “Apprentice” staffers I spoke to recalled hearing Trump speak coarsely about women. “He wasn’t going around saying ‘pussy, pussy, pussy’ all the time,” Walker said. But he regularly made comments about the bodies of female contestants and female staffers. One “Apprentice” employee told me, “He’d say, ‘How about those boobs? Wouldn’t you like to fuck her?’ ” Even so, Braun said he doubted that there was any “Apprentice” tape in which Trump uses the N-word. “I was the supervising editor on the first six seasons,” he said. “I didn’t watch every frame, but in everything I saw I didn’t hear him saying anything so horrible.” Braun noted that editors on reality shows often amuse themselves by compiling “gag” reels of a cast member’s most off-color or embarrassing moments. The producers may be barred, legally, from airing such outtakes, but that doesn’t stop editors from sharing them internally. Tom Arnold told me that he has seen one such reel from “The Apprentice,” in which Trump uses the N-word. But Braun, who is dismayed that Trump is President, is dubious. “If there was a tape, it would have spread like wildfire,” he said. Another “Apprentice” staffer made the same point: “If somebody had the goods, it would have leaked long ago. There were no Trump fans on the set. I don’t know a single person who worked on the show who voted for Trump.” Whenever Trump appeared on the show, the staffer explained, there were “at least a hundred people watching him,” with a dozen cameras capturing every angle. Live feeds were transmitted to executives not just at NBC but at corporations sponsoring the episode. The staffer continued, “In the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape, Donald was on a bus. He thought he was alone. He never thought he was alone in the boardroom. It was a set.” To Braun, the hunt for the tapes feels like a distraction. “We’ve seen that it doesn’t matter,” he said. “He now says plenty of things that are outwardly racist, misogynist, and fascist. It just doesn’t hurt him.” After Manigault Newman made her claims about the “Apprentice” tapes, The Economist conducted a survey, and found that seventy-seven per cent of white Trump voters felt that “it is possible that a person who uses the ‘N-word’ while in office can still be a good President.” More than a third of white Trump voters admitted to using the word themselves. One day this past fall, Burnett got a call from his first wife, Kym Gold, with whom he remains friendly. Gold was upset about what was happening in the country, and asked Burnett to intervene with Trump. “We had it out,” she told me. “I said, ‘You’ve got to help our children, for the future and safety of this country.’ ” Gold implored Burnett, “Tell him this is not a reality show. This is real life. You’re the President. You’re saying things you cannot say—to reporters, to other world leaders.” Burnett heard her out. “I’m not into politics,” he told her. “I’m not even on Twitter.” But he said that he had no intention of speaking out against Trump or of releasing any tapes. “I’m just a guy who produces shows,” he insisted. Burnett may not be a policy maven, but he has long been fascinated with political star power. In 2010, he launched “Sarah Palin’s Alaska,” on TLC, announcing, “With a dynamic personality that has captivated millions, I can’t think of anyone more compelling than Sarah Palin to tell the story of Alaska.” At the time, Burnett contended that the show was “completely nonpolitical.” The Daily Beast disagreed, suggesting that it “may qualify as the earliest, most expensive Presidential campaign ad ever made.” Burnett and Trump have licensed the “Apprentice” format to dozens of other countries, and Burnett once noted that, increasingly, tycoons cast in the Trump role are “people with political aspirations.” At least half a dozen hosts have held political office, including João Doria, the governor-elect of São Paulo State, who is an ally of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s strongman President-elect. Last year, Kevin O’Leary, one of the hosts of “Shark Tank,” announced his intention of running for Prime Minister of Canada, as a member of the Conservative Party, noting that he and Trump had “both worked for Mark Burnett, and we both got famous on reality television.” Burnett joked to more than one person that he was no longer simply a TV producer but a producer of political leaders. (Four months later, O’Leary dropped out of the race and returned to the show.) For nearly two decades, Burnett has also spoken about his desire to make a television show with Vladimir Putin. In 2001, he sought to enlist Putin in a project called “Destination: Mir,” a reality competition in which the winner would be sent into space. The idea was scuttled after Russia decommissioned the Mir space station. In 2015, Burnett expressed an interest in building a reality show featuring Putin—not so much a program about politics, Burnett suggested, as a hymn to the glory of Russia, “the humans, the nature, the animals of the nation.” Burnett’s myopia about politics may be selective, but that does not mean it is feigned. He would hardly be the first Hollywood chieftain with a dim grasp of current events beyond Los Angeles, but even by industry standards he can seem remarkably disconnected. Shortly after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, this past February, Burnett attended a regular meeting of television executives at M-G-M. At one point, someone mentioned the marketing plan for a project in the studio’s film division: a remake of “Death Wish,” starring Bruce Willis. The movie, about an armed vigilante, was unabashedly pro-gun—Breitbart eventually hailed it as an “N.R.A. Public Service Announcement.” Someone asked whether M-G-M would be altering the rollout of the film, in light of the shooting. “What shooting?” Burnett said, according to someone outside M-G-M who was briefed on the meeting. When his incredulous colleagues wondered how he could not have been aware of the Parkland massacre, Burnett said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” adding, “I’m not on social media.” For all Burnett’s talk about being nonpolitical, his reluctance to disavow the President may stem, in part, from a fear of alienating Trump’s constituents. Like Republican lawmakers or evangelical pastors, Burnett is beholden to a faction of the public that, in many instances, thinks the President can do no wrong. “The moment you go political, you turn half of the nation against you,” Rick Warren told me. “And, when you’re trying to reach as many people as you can, you don’t want to do that.” The dilemma is compounded, Warren pointed out, when the occupant of the White House is so vindictive. “You know the way this President chews up people?” Warren said. “There’s a fine line in what you can say.” Katherine Walker suggested that part of the reason Burnett seems so unfazed by the role he has played in the Trump saga may be that he is British. “There is something to being American and having these visceral reactions that Mark doesn’t have,” she said. “He just doesn’t get it on that level. I don’t think he has the same sense of Oh, my God, what have I done?” For many Americans, the Trump Presidency evokes a painful feeling of dispossession, as cherished norms and national institutions are eviscerated. “People are making it seem like Mark’s ignoring evil,” Walker continued. “But I think it’s more benign than that—and scarier, in a way. He doesn’t care. He just wants to stay out of it.” “Mark is extremely smart,” Richard Levak, the psychologist who consulted for Burnett on “The Apprentice,” told me. “Mark has an eye for casting, and he cast Donald Trump.” I asked Levak what kind of personality profile he might have prepared for Trump as a candidate for the show. He said he would have noted “the energy, the impulsiveness, the inability to articulate a complete thought because he gets interrupted by emotions, so when he speaks it’s all adjectives—‘great,’ ‘huge,’ ‘horrible.’ ” What made Trump so magnetic as a reality-television star was his impulse to transgress, Levak continued, and it is the same quality that has made a captive audience of the world. “That somebody can become that successful while also being that emotionally undisciplined—it’s so macabre that you have to watch it,” he said. “And you keep waiting for the comeuppance. But it doesn’t come.” There has likely never been a man who, in his own lifetime, has been as widely spoken and written about as Donald Trump. Politics has never been so spellbinding. “It’s the reason people watch a schoolyard fight,” Levak said. “It’s vicariously watching someone act out and get away with it.” Burnett once remarked that “Lord of the Flies” is so absorbing because all the characters are suddenly transported into a world in which “the rules are changed, and convention, law, and morality are suspended.” It’s an apt paraphrase of the Trump Presidency. On Sunday afternoons, Burnett likes to pour himself a generous glass of wine and stroll out onto the balcony of his seven-thousand-square-foot home, off the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. He and Downey refer to the property, which was undamaged by the recent wildfires, as the Sanctuary. It is an exquisite spot, with white couches facing an unbroken view of the ocean. Burnett likes to reflect on the fact that his mansion is not far from one of the homes where, as a young immigrant, he worked as a nanny. He is on social media, as it happens. He seldom tweets, but he’s active on Instagram. Along with family snapshots and photographs of Burnett palling around with celebrities and religious figures, there are a couple of videos he has taken of himself relaxing on the balcony. “Lazy Sunday afternoon,” Burnett says in one of them. He is barefoot, wearing a T-shirt that says “SPIRITUAL GANGSTER.” He gestures at his expansive view, with undisguised satisfaction, and says, “Look at this. Wow.” He pans the camera across the sky, which is just starting to bruise red and violet in the twilight. “So grateful,” Burnett says. He often expresses wonderment at how blessed he is, and at the magnitude of his success—which, these days, he ascribes to “God’s favor.” When I remarked to Jonathon Braun that Burnett seems eerily untroubled by the legacy of his own creation, he said that, for Burnett, the Presidency was just another game. He went on, “I think it’s a game for Trump, too. It’s a game for the audience. I think the voters like it. They’re enjoying the spectacle. It’s in the soul of who Mark is. They’re kindred spirits. There are no major causes driving them—it’s just about playing a game and winning it.” Years ago, when Burnett did publicity for “Survivor,” interviewers tried to figure out how the contestants had fared that season. Of course, he could not reveal such secrets. So when they asked Burnett who would win the game, he told them, “Me.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

386,https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/2018s-big-victory-nra-hasnt-figured-hit-parkland-students-fought-back/,"One of the biggest political stories of 2018 was the success of high school students making the National Rifle Association politically toxic following the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. MSNBC's ""Deadline: White House"" with guest host Elise Jordan examined on Thursday the political success the students achieved. ""The mass shooting at their high school in February marked a turning point in the gun safety debate, this year we saw over a million people protest during the march for our lives and many state legislatures passed stricter gun laws,"" Jordan reported. ""In further proof of the attitude shift, the NRA has seen its financial situation worsen in the era of Donald Trump."" For analysis, Jordan brought on Dave Cullen, the author of the book Columbine and the upcoming book Parkland. ""Did the Parkland kids change the equation when it comes to gun control in America?"" Foley asked. ""They totally changed it,"" he replied. ""I don't think the NRA has figured out what hit them and they still have not figured out what to do with these kids,"" he added. ""These Parkland students really are the heroes,"" MoveOn senior advisor Karine Jean-Pierre said. ""And so they were relentless,"" she continued. ""They became activists, politically involved and not only that, we had something else that played in their favor ... technology."" ""You have social media, that played a big role in this,"" she explained. Watch:  Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney (WY) on Tuesday fired back at Republicans critical of her role in the commission to investigate Jan. 6, saying, ""This is absolutely not a game. This is deadly serious."" ""There are some in my party, including Leader McCarthy, who continue to act as though this is about partisan politics, I think it's really sad. I think it's a disgrace,"" she told ABC's George Stephanopoulos.    According to a report from Forbes, lawyers who brought lawsuits attacking the 2020 presidential election results in Michigan by alleging voter fraud are attempting to use Donald Trump's words to avoid sanctions. On the evening before House select committee opens hearings into the Jan 6th Capitol riot that was inspired by accusations that the election was stolen from Trump, the so-called ""Kraken"" attorneys, including one-time Trump attorney Sidney Powell, made a new filing.        Former president Donald Trump's alleged efforts to get Justice Department officials to overturn the results of the 2020 election constitution an ""extraordinary circumstance"" and are not protected by executive privilege, the DOJ wrote in a letter this week. In the letter obtained by the New York Times, the DOJ advised officials who served in the Trump administration that they can give ""unrestricted testimony"" to committees investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, including the House panel that will meet for the first time Tuesday.

387,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/house-democrats-eye-legislation-background-checks/578473/?utm_source=feed,"Members of the new House majority plan to introduce gun legislation they don’t expect to pass. But they want to make a point. During the November elections, a number of Democratic House candidates made gun control a central theme of their midterm campaign, and dozens more gave the issue strong emphasis on the trail. Next month, they might have a chance to follow through on their campaign promises with legislation requiring federal background checks on all gun sales. The legislation isn’t likely to become law. It will be a bit like Republican House efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act back in 2017, said Adam Winkler, a constitutional-law professor at UCLA: a symbolic gesture that never becomes the law of the land, but that nonetheless serves a political purpose. While the GOP’s attempts to repeal the ACA ultimately hurt some Republicans in the midterm elections, Democrats believe their gun-control efforts will help the cause.“It’ll show two things,” said Representative Mike Thompson of California, the chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, in an interview, “that we care about our community’s safety, and it’ll show that we listen to voters.” Read: Gun control is not impossible House Democrats, led by Thompson, are planning to introduce the legislation within the first 100 days of the new Congress, according to a report from Politico on Monday. “The new Democratic majority will act boldly and decisively to pass commonsense, life-saving background checks that are overwhelmingly supported by the American people,” incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. And activists want to do it by February 14, the one-year anniversary of the 2018 shooting in Parkland, Florida. The Senate is still under Republican control, which means the likelihood that such a bill would make it to President Donald Trump’s desk is slim. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled that he wouldn’t take up a bill like this, and it’s unclear if Trump would sign it even if he did. Still, Democrats and gun-control advocates view the potential move as an important symbol. Since 1994, a federal background check has been required for every individual purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed gun dealer. But experts estimate that some 20 percent of gun sales occur over the internet or at gun shows, from unlicensed dealers. Thompson’s bill would change that. The legislation, which will likely be co-authored by Republican Representative Peter King of New York as well as several other as yet unnamed lawmakers, would require federal background checks on virtually all types of gun sales, with just a few exceptions. Read: As students ‘march for our lives,’ what are the feasible aims for gun control? A majority of both gun owners and non–gun owners support universal background checks, according to the Pew Research Center, and researchers argue that expanding them works: States that already require background checks on all gun purchases experienced 35 percent less gun deaths per capita than states without the requirement, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thompson and King proposed similar legislation last year, but their bill was never taken up by Republican leadership for a vote. Now, though, things have changed. Democrats won back a decisive majority in the House in November, and activists claim that the tide is shifting. “The passage of a universal-background-check bill is something that we haven’t seen in 20 years,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, “probably the most convincing proof yet that American political leaders are catching up with the American people.” In the 10 months since 17 students and staff members were killed in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, energy has amassed on the side of grassroots gun-control groups and prompted nationwide marches and student walkouts. In the 2018 midterms, these groups outspent the National Rifle Association for the first time in history, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Revenue at the NRA reportedly declined by 15 percent in 2017, and its membership dues dropped to a five-year low. On Tuesday, the Trump administration unveiled a new regulation officially banning bump-fire stocks. “The pattern has been pretty predictable, where for too long a tragic shooting occurs, it captures the attention of the nation, the country mourns, political leaders ask for prayers, and then the gun lobby ends up getting its way,” Feinblatt said. “There’s no question [people] are convinced it’s time to break the pattern.” Indeed, several Democratic candidates ran—and won—in November after placing gun control at the center of their midterm campaign. A U.S. House candidate in Georgia, Lucy McBath, whose teenage son was shot and killed at a gas station in 2012, ran for office because she believed lawmakers weren’t doing enough to address gun violence. McBath narrowly defeated her Republican opponent, Karen Handel, last month. Other candidates, such as Jason Crow, who beat the Republican Mike Coffman in Colorado, and Jennifer Wexton, who defeated Barbara Comstock in Virginia, also chose to emphasize rather than downplay gun control in their campaign messages. “We have reached a tipping point on this issue. I thought it would have happened a long time ago,” said Crow, who recently joined Thompson’s gun-violence task force, in an interview. After multiple mass shootings rocked his state—the 2012 attack at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora happened in Crow’s congressional district—Colorado passed its own universal-background-check legislation. “We’ve already led on this issue, and it’s well past time we take the Colorado example and extend that to the nation,” Crow told me. Incoming Representative Haley Stevens, who also made guns a central focus in her bid to represent Michigan’s Eleventh Congressional District, said she recently joined the gun-violence-prevention task force and plans to support Thompson’s legislation. “People are sick of living like this, sick of seeing the mass shootings, the gun violence in our neighborhoods, feeling like nowhere is safe,” Stevens said in an interview. “They’re looking to the government to get something done.” Both experts and critics of the legislation point out that universal background checks won’t solve America’s gun-violence problem. Many of the recent high-profile shootings that Americans recognize now by mononymous names—Parkland, Newtown, Aurora—probably wouldn’t have been prevented by a federally mandated background check. Background checks “are designed to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from getting their hands on guns,” said Winkler, the UCLA professor. “How they do that is by looking at adjudications.” In other words, someone who hasn’t been convicted of a felony or confirmed to have a mental illness would still pass a background check. “We are concerned that it is a solution in search of a problem,” said Michael Hammond, the longtime legislative counsel to Gun Owners of America, a nonprofit group dedicated to protecting gun rights. “Which leads to the question: What’s the [Democrats’] objective here? Is it achieving policy or putting points on the board?” Gun-control opponents like Hammond have long been worried about the creation of a gun-control registry that they fear could ultimately be used by the federal government to confiscate Americans’ firearms. To counter this concern, Thompson’s legislation actually includes a provision making it a federal crime to create a gun registry. But Hammond told me he’s worried that passing background-check legislation is a slippery slope—one that could lead to tighter restrictions, such as a ban on large-capacity magazines or semi-automatic weapons. “I don’t think the other side believes [universal background checks] will stop the shootings. It’s not about policy; it’s about politics,” Hammond said. It’s “the left destroying what it perceives as the strongest remaining pillar of the Republican movement.” If Thompson’s legislation passes the House next year, it sets up Democrats for a deeper debate about gun control heading into the 2020 general election—when they’ve got a chance to retake the Senate and the White House. It’s a chance both lawmakers and activists are optimistic about. “The calculus has changed,” said Feinblatt, from Everytown. “When Sandy Hook happened, and the background-check bill went down in defeat, people said [gun control] was still the third rail of American politics. Nobody’s saying that anymore.”",2018-12-19 08:17:02,Democrats Want Universal Background Checks on Guns,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,elections",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
388,https://www.rawstory.com/2018/11/hate-crimes-canada-jump-47-percent-2017/,"Hate crimes in Canada increased 47 percent in 2017, primarily targeting Muslims, Jews and black people, according to figures released by the country’s statistical agency on Thursday. The biggest increase was in crimes targeting Muslims, Statistics Canada reported, in a year that saw a deadly mass shooting in a Quebec mosque, followed by a government motion to study Islamophobia that itself sparked anti-Muslim sentiment. The spike mirrors an increase in hate crimes south of the border in the United States, where they rose in 2017 for the third consecutive year, according to the FBI. “We were shocked by the numbers - and, at the same time, we weren’t,” said Ihsaan Gardee, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. “This increase didn’t occur in a vacuum.” Canada is not immune to rhetoric coming from the United States, said Amira Elghawaby, a board member of the Anti-Hate Network advocacy group. “It’s a porous border, not just for people and goods but for ideas.” The statistics published Thursday include crimes reported to police that were determined to be motivated by hatred toward an identifiable group. According to victimization surveys, two-thirds of these crimes go unreported, Statistics Canada said. The number of hate crimes targeting Muslims more than doubled, rising to 349 from 139. The number of hate crimes targeting black people increased by 50 percent, to 321 from 214. And the number of hate crimes targeting Jewish people increased to 360 from 221. It is not yet known whether the upward trend in hate crimes continued through 2018, which saw such high-profile incidents as a Muslim man beaten in front of his family in a parking lot and Jewish teenagers attacked walking down the street. “We’re following this closely,” Gardee said. “And we’ll continue to raise our voice for more coordinated action across the board.” Reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; Editing by Tom Brown Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney (WY) on Tuesday fired back at Republicans critical of her role in the commission to investigate Jan. 6, saying, ""This is absolutely not a game. This is deadly serious.""

389,https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/heres-trump-killed-gop-midterms-may-destroy-2020-campaign/,"Evil days. The midterms were bearing down on us like a runaway train with Donald Trump in the driver’s seat and the throttle wide open, the Presidential Special hell-bent for the bottom. “Go Trump Go!” tweeted David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, as if the president needed anyone’s encouragement. There had been no slacking after pipe bombs were sent to a number of his critics; nor after two black people were killed in Kentucky by a white man who, minutes before, had tried to enter a predominantly black church; nor after 11 worshippers in Pittsburgh were murdered at the Tree of Life Congregation synagogue by a man who’d expressed special loathing for HIAS, a Jewish refugee resettlement and advocacy organization. “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” Robert Bowers posted on his Gab account hours before the massacre. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” This article was first published at Tom's Dispatch. Trump, relentless Trump, went right on raging about “invasions,” left-wing “mobs,” globalists, MS-13, and “caravan after caravan [of] illegal immigrants” invited in by Democrats to murder Americans, vote illegally, and mooch off our health care system. “Hate speech leads to hate crimes,” Rabbi Jeffrey Myers told the president in Pittsburgh several days after the murders. The FBI had previously reported a large spike in hate crimes over the previous two years, and the Anti-Defamation League noted a 60% rise in anti-Semitic incidents from 2016 to 2017. Then there was this, reported in the New York Times on the day before the election: “Advisers to the president said his foes take his campaign rally language too literally; as outrageous as it might seem, it is more entertainment, intended to generate a crowd reaction.” And Trump himself, when asked why he wasn’t campaigning on the strong economy, responded: “Sometimes it’s not as exciting to talk about the economy.” Not as exciting as, say, hate and xenophobia. And so one was led to wonder: Do countries have souls — with all the moral consequence implied by the concept of soul? If the answer is yes, then it follows that the collective soul can be corrupted and damned just as surely as that of a flesh-and-blood human being. In this election, as in all others, grave matters of policy were at stake, but we sensed something even bigger on the line in 2018 — nothing less than whether the country was past redeeming. Lower, smaller, meaner “I’m on the ballot,” Trump declared at a rally in Mississippi, and so he was. For the first time in two years, the country would render its verdict on the garish aggressions of his politics, though it bore noting that many members of his party had already voted with their feet. In the preceding months, more than 40 House Republicans had resigned outright or announced that they would not seek reelection, among them the relatively moderate chairs of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Appropriations Committee, and, most significantly, House Speaker Paul Ryan. It was an extraordinary exodus by any measure, especially for a party holding both chambers of Congress and the White House -- a party possessed, that is, of the kind of power that pols dream of. Yet here were Republicans bailing out in droves. The usual reasons were given: the desire to spend more time with family, to confront new challenges, and so forth, but the party’s scorched-earth politics of the past 30 years, the ones that had put Donald Trump in the White House, undoubtedly had something to do with it. The hyper-partisanship championed by Newt Gingrich when he was speaker of the House in the mid-1990s, the embrace of fringe elements like the birther crowd and the alt-right, the systematic trashing of longstanding institutions and traditions (like the weaponizing of the filibuster, to name just one) and now the ultimate scorched-earther in the White House: it’s easy to imagine how the more self-aware members of the Republican caucus could see no viable future for themselves in politics. Ryan, in particular, furnished food for thought. Like John Boehner before him, he couldn’t tame the far-right beast that was the Freedom Caucus and he had Trump to deal with too. How many nights had the Speaker tossed and turned in his bed secretly pining for rational Obama? And then there was the massive contradiction of Ryan’s own politics. Eager for Republicans to get credit for the economic expansion that began in June 2009 and was now in its 100th month, Ryan studiously ignored the fact that — predicting rampant inflation and worse — he’d opposed Obama’s program of fiscal stimulus and easy monetary policy that had produced the longest expansion in the country’s history. But Ryan’s contradiction cut even deeper. As House Speaker, at the very pinnacle of his career as a supply-side disciple and deficit hawk, he had shepherded into law a legislative agenda that was projected to start producing trillion-dollar-a-year deficits by 2020. Paul Ryan had played out his political string. To proceed further could only monsterize his psyche, twist it into a Jekyll-and-Hyde-style schizophrenia, a form of madness not unknown among twenty-first-century American politicians. With Trump as their leader, Republicans had no place to go but lower, smaller, meaner — and so they went. Trump praised and reenacted a Montana congressman’s criminal assault on a reporter, and suggested that U.S. troops open fire on any aspiring immigrant so bold as to throw a rock at them. In Georgia, robocalls described Stacey Abrams, a black woman and the Democratic nominee for governor, as a “poor man’s Aunt Jemima.” Congressman Duncan Hunter put out an ad characterizing his opponent, Ammar Campa-Najjar, as a terrorist sympathizer. Ron DeSantis urged Florida voters not to “monkey this up” by electing Andrew Gillum, a black man, as their governor, while in Kansas, a Republican official called congressional candidate Sharice Davids (a Native American and graduate of Cornell Law School) a “radical socialist kickboxing lesbian” who should be “sent back packing to the reservation.” Antonio Delgado, who is black, a Rhodes scholar, and a Harvard Law School graduate, was repeatedly characterized as “a big-city rapper” in ads supporting his opponent for a congressional seat in New York’s Hudson Valley. Representative Kevin McCarthy, jockeying to replace Paul Ryan as leader of the House Republicans, loudly revived the push to fund Trump’s border wall, and Representative Steve King fantasized at a rally that Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor “will elope to Cuba.” Pro-GOP flyers featuring anti-Semitic caricatures were distributed in opposition to Jewish Democratic candidates in Alaska, California, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Washington, and elsewhere. The loudest hysterics were reserved for the bedraggled, footsore “caravan of invaders” inching its way north through Mexico, several thousand desperate souls bringing, according to Trump, crime and terrorists. On Fox Business, Chris Farrell, a conservative activist, promoted the ongoing right-wing allegation that George Soros, who is Jewish, was paying migrants to come to the U.S. Kris Kobach, GOP candidate for governor of Kansas, declared that Democrats had “open-border psychosis.” Ted Cruz, fighting for his political life in Texas, led chants of “Build that wall!” at his rallies. The final TV ad for Scott Wagner, the GOP nominee for governor of Pennsylvania, asserted that “a dangerous caravan of illegals careens to the border”; this same Scott Wagner had previously urged his Democratic opponent to wear a catcher’s mask because “I’m going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes.” Trump deployed some 5,600 active-duty troops south “to secure the border,” at a cost projected to be as high as $200 million, and his final campaign ad -- deemed so blatantly racist that Facebook and major TV networks, including Fox, refused to air it -- featured scary music, images of brown-skinned people, and a cop-killing undocumented immigrant with no known link to the caravan. The ad’s final image urged: “Stop the Caravan. Vote Republican.” It was crude. It was dumb. It was all basically nuts. The question was: how much of America would buy it? Record numbers The day after the election, Trump appeared before the media to proclaim “very close to a complete victory.” Then he proceeded to riff on the size of his crowds. It would take days — a week and then some — to measure properly the scale of the electorate’s repudiation of Trump. Despite surgical gerrymandering and voter-suppression measures that strongly favored the GOP, Democrats took control of the House by flipping 43 seats, for a net gain of 40. It was the biggest Democratic gain since the Watergate midterm of 1974, when Democrats picked up 49 seats, and the Democrats’ 9.4 million lead (and counting) in raw votes this year was the largest margin ever by a party in a midterm. Overall turnout was the highest in 50 years: 116 million, or 49.4% of the voting-eligible population, compared to 83 million in 2014. Democrats won women -- who are not only the majority of voters but the most reliable of them -- by 19 percentage points. Particularly in the suburbs, where 50% of voters now live, white women with college degrees broke hard for Democrats, but House Democratic candidates also increased their national vote margin among white working-class women by 13 points. Young voters and minorities (think: the future) turned out in unprecedented numbers and voted overwhelmingly Democratic. The Democrats also won independents by 12%, and voters who had opted for a third-party candidate in 2016 by 13%. Trump’s misogyny, racism, and xenophobia helped elect a new House majority that will be nearly half women, a third people of color, and include more Muslim Americans, Native Americans, and LGBTQ members than ever before. Republicans increased their razor-thin majority in the Senate by two, but even there evidence of the Trump repudiation was strong. Democrats were defending 26 of the 35 seats in play and, in almost every race, the Democratic candidate outperformed the state’s partisan lean (the average difference between how a state votes and how the overall country votes) while racking up a nationwide total of 50.5 million votes, to the GOP’s 34.5 million. Yeah, Beto lost. He also came within 2.6 points of knocking off a well-financed, highly disciplined incumbent in a deep-red state and was instrumental in making Texas newly competitive at both the statewide and local levels. In governors’ races, Democrats flipped seven states to the Republicans’ one and achieved a net gain of more than 300 legislative seats. State ballot measures on politically charged issues also trended blue. Arkansas and Missouri voted to raise their minimum wage. Utah, Nebraska, and Idaho voted to expand Medicaid and, with the election of a Democratic governor, Maine will follow through on last year’s winning referendum to expand Medicaid. Florida voters approved a referendum to restore voting rights to former felons. Arizona defeated a Koch brothers-backed measure to privatize public education by a two to one margin. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania — states crucial to Trump’s Electoral College success in 2016 — swung dramatically back toward the Democrats in 2018. Putting real issues front and center This thing Trump was selling, this white-nationalist-freak-out-throwback special, played well enough to the base to flip Senate seats in North Dakota, Indiana, and Missouri, all states Trump won by big margins in 2016, as well as Florida’s closely contested Senate seat. But here’s the real shocker, the development that made this midterm “transformational,” as reported by Stanley Greenberg in the New York Times, based on a Democracy Corps election night survey: the Democrats’ biggest gains in 2018 came in rural America. Greenberg also relied on an Edison exit poll for CNN that showed the Republican margin in rural areas shrinking by double digits and a Catalist poll indicating a seven-point shrinkage. “Exciting” the base seems to have come at a cost: a 13-point swing by white working-class women, a 14-point swing by white working-class men, and a 7-point swing among all men. While Trump’s Twitter account was acting like the social media equivalent of a spastic colon, Democrats were pushing a decidedly non-hysterical message focused on health care (coverage for preexisting conditions, preserving Obamacare, and protecting Medicare and Medicaid) and basic economic fairness. As for Trump’s manifest unfitness for office, smart Democrats assumed the president himself would pound home that message. Yes, there was a blue wave in 2018, and the “centrist” establishment Democrats who have steered the party for the past 30 years are trying to claim it for themselves. Don’t believe them. These establishment centrists — the ideological heirs of the defunct Democratic Leadership Council who now ply their trade at the Third Way think tank in the capital, along with the big-donor class, the top-dollar Washington consultants, and the data mills that comprise the Democratic election industrial complex — stand for something far different than the blue-wave centrists who powered the party in 2018. For more than 30 years — ever since the rise of the “New Democrats” and the Democratic Leadership Council in the 1980s — establishment centrists have practiced the top-down politics of neoliberalism, a politics founded on the free-market gospel: deregulation of banking and finance, friendliness toward corporate monopolies, limited support (at best) for labor unions and workers, the endless “liberalization” of global trade, and reflexive antagonism for the social safety net. As all the numbers show, corporate America and the One Percent reaped the lion’s share of neoliberalism’s benefits, while the Democratic Party’s once-traditional constituencies — poor people, and the working and middle classes — fell further and further behind. The party itself — once the dominant force in national politics, and in the majority of states — gradually slid into minority status, culminating in the wipeout of 2016. 2018’s blue-wave centrists are made of different stuff. This year's energy came from the bottom up, thanks to widespread local activism and grassroots organizing, much of it led by women newly politicized in the wake of 2016. The party’s small-donor base became increasingly powerful, enabling candidates like Beto O’Rourke to run robustly financed campaigns while refusing PAC money and the strings that come with it. This same small-donor and activist groundswell made Democrats competitive in regions long ago written off by establishment centrists who have long been less focused on the concerns of working people than on cherry-picking just enough Electoral College votes to win the presidency every four years. In 2018, however, we saw Democratic candidates running and winning in deep-red areas while talking up labor unions (Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania), slamming the “rigged system” that neoliberalism produced (Max Rose on New York’s Staten Island), and pushing for common-sense gun control (Lucy McBath in Georgia). Democrats interested in taking back the Midwest should look to the example of Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, one of Bernie Sanders’s closest allies in the Senate. A strong voice for labor and the middle class and a longtime skeptic of international trade deals, Brown won reelection by seven percentage points in a state otherwise trending Republican. The same was true for Senator Amy Klobuchar, who has prioritized the interests of working people her entire career. She won reelection by 24 points in Minnesota, a state Trump almost won in 2016. The blue-wave centrists put real issues front and center: housing, wages, access to health care, basic fairness and opportunity for working people. Whatever name you want to put to these issues — centrist, progressive, populist, lunch bucket, kitchen table — these haven’t been the priorities of the establishment centrists of the past 30 years. For a clue, look no farther than the Third Way’s close ties to K Street, the epicenter of corporate lobbying in Washington, and to the investment banking industry. Trump lost in 2018, but he remains nearly as powerful as ever. He’s a sitting president with a ferociously loyal base, a Senate majority that’s about to get bigger, and a federal judiciary that hews further to the right with each new raft of appointments. In the days since the election he’s shown no moderating tendencies, instead threatening the incoming House Democratic majority with a “warlike posture,” firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, illegally“appointing” a sketchy acting attorney general, further defying the Refugee Act of 1980, banning a CNN reporter from the White House, and defending Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the state-sponsored murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump is still Trump, and America is still America. In the days after the election, wildfires raged through northern California, leaving scores dead and many thousands homeless, and in the country’s 307th mass shooting in the first 313 days of 2018, a gunman killed 13 people at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California. Welcome to the struggle for the country’s soul. We haven’t seen anything yet. Ben Fountain’s Beautiful Country Burn Again: Democracy, Rebellion, and Revolution has just been published by Ecco/HarperCollins.

But it also may have caused a longer-term shift in America’s gun politics. 2018 may have been the year when Americans finally started getting really, genuinely fed up with mass shootings. In February, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, led to a new movement — the March for Our Lives — advocating for stricter gun laws. But its work did not stop with a march and some protests around the country; the movement, along with other work by other gun control advocacy groups, managed to get major legislative and electoral victories throughout the rest of the year. The victories could endure beyond 2018. Now that Democrats, who ran in part on gun control, have seized control not just of the US House but several state legislatures and governors’ mansions, they will have a chance to implement or at least push for stronger firearm laws. What happens next depends on how engaged American voters remain on this issue in the years to come. While the aftermath of the Parkland shooting suggests that there may have been a shift in this debate, the permanence of that change is far from guaranteed. Gun control has long suffered from an intensity gap: Opponents of stricter gun laws are willing to vote based on that one issue, while supporters of gun control usually aren’t. It’s possible that the effects of 2018 will fade away, and the nation will return to its usual combination of initial sorrow and ultimate inaction after mass shootings. But if the trends of 2018 hold and the gap really does narrow, it will mean that the aftermath of the Parkland shooting won’t just help gun control advocates win over the next couple years — it could be a longer-term change for America. After mass shootings, it’s easy to look at the aftermath in Congress and despair: How is it that no matter what happens nothing gets done? But the federal government is not the only one making new gun laws in America. The states are busy doing their own thing as well. And at the state level, a lot happened in 2018. According to the Giffords Law Center (which supports stricter gun laws), 26 states and Washington, DC, enacted a total of 67 new gun control laws this year — more than triple the number of stricter gun laws enacted in 2017. The 2018 measures include a higher minimum age to buy guns, restrictions for domestic abusers, “red flag” laws that let law enforcement take away guns from people deemed a risk, and new urban gun violence reduction programs. Some of these passed in states with Republican leaders. In Florida, the GOP-controlled legislature and Republican Gov. Rick Scott approved legislation that raised the minimum age to buy guns and added a waiting period for firearm purchases, among other changes. In Vermont, Republican Gov. Phil Scott signed gun control laws that included expanded background checks and a “red flag” law. At the same time, there was a decrease in the number of new laws loosening access to guns. So Parkland didn’t just apparently inspire more support for gun control; it also led to less support for new, less-restrictive gun laws. Maggie Astor and Karl Russell reported for the New York Times that NRA data “shows a similar overall trend this year, with gun control measures passed overtaking pro-gun measures for the first time in at least six years, though to a lesser extent than the Giffords data shows.” There are limitations to the state-level measures. As long as some states maintain weak gun laws, people can simply cross state lines and obtain firearms in those gun-friendly states. This is a big problem in places with stronger gun laws, including Chicago, Massachusetts, and New York. That’s why stronger federal laws are needed. Still, the gun control laws are significant measures that are now on the books and, based on the research, will reduce gun deaths, even if federal laws would have a stronger effect. And the big reason for that is the activism surrounding Parkland. Of course, no one believes that what happened in 2018 is anywhere near enough to solve America’s gun violence problem. The bigger question is whether the Parkland movement had a significant effect on longer-term trends, which may over time lead to stronger gun laws. When it comes to overall support for stronger gun laws, there was a significant spike shortly after Parkland: Based on Gallup’s surveys, support for stricter gun laws in March 2018 hit 67 percent, up from 55 percent in October 2016 and 60 percent in October 2017 (after the Las Vegas mass shooting). But that support dropped by October this year to 61 percent — still higher than it was previously, but not that far off historical levels. So Parkland may not have led to a big, permanent boost in support for gun control — at least, not levels of support that are historically anomalous. But if you look at the chart above, it should become pretty clear that there’s almost always been majority support for stricter gun laws. If anything, Gallup’s findings understate levels of support for gun control: When people are asked about specific policies, support climbs to the 70s and 80s. The problem, then, has never been whether a majority of Americans support gun control. The problem, instead, is what’s known as the intensity gap: Essentially, even though more Americans support gun control laws, those on the side opposing stricter measures have long been more passionate about the issue — more likely to make guns the one issue they vote on, more likely to call their representatives in Congress, and so on. As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000, “The question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their ‘control’ position?” Probably not, he suggested, “but for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this.” This is where gun control advocates need to make some movement. And there are signs that there really was some movement following Parkland. For one, a lot of people turned out to protest during the March for Our Lives earlier this year. It’s notoriously difficult to gauge the effects of these kinds of demonstrations, but it’s notable that the protests around the country numbered in the hundreds of thousands and became one of the biggest youth-led protests in decades. Americans also seem increasingly fed up with mass shootings. According to a poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, US adults’ second-most common response for the most important event of the year, after the improving economy, was mass shootings. There were similar findings in 2017, which also had a lot of high-profile mass shootings. These tragedies are clearly getting a lot of Americans’ attention. The other important indicator here is that politicians who backed gun control won big this year in the midterm elections. This was partly a result of a blue wave, since Democrats are simply more likely to support stricter gun laws. (Although some Democrats, particularly in more conservative areas, are still running gun-friendly campaigns.) But it’s notable that some Democrats ran strongly on guns and won. Alex Yablon and Daniel Nass at the Trace pointed to Jason Crow, who won a House seat in Colorado, as “the poster boy for proudly pro-gun control Democrats in twin late-season articles in the New York Times (‘Bearing F’s From the NRA, Some Democrats Are Campaigning Openly on Guns’) and Washington Post (‘Suburban Democrats Campaign on Gun-Control Policies as NRA Spending Plummets’) summing up the new political dynamic in swing state suburbs.” Equally important, Republicans who supported gun control also won. That includes Vermont Gov. Scott, who won reelection in a state that, despite its liberal reputation, has long been resistant to gun laws. And it includes Florida Gov. Scott, who beat Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson in the US Senate race. In the past, NRA criticism may have ended both these candidates. But even though the NRA downgraded both of them in its candidate scorecards, they won their respective elections. These midterm elections will have longer-term impacts. As Reid Wilson reported for the Hill, newly elected Democrats are planning to push for stricter gun laws at the state and federal levels in the next year. Beyond 2019, the midterm elections showed that candidates can support stronger gun laws — and even focus a campaign on the issue — and still win elections, even in states that have been resistant to stronger gun laws in the past. This is a shift: Since 1994, when stricter gun laws were partly blamed for electoral losses, Democrats have often shied away from the issue. It remains to be seen whether the shift on guns will hold in the coming years. But if it does, it would amount to a significant change in America’s politics — one that can be pinpointed back to Parkland. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

The incident, in front of University of Mississippi Medical Center, was first reported to police as a possible mass shooting in progress, Jackson Police Chief James Davis told reporters. A 1-year-old child in the car was struck in the leg and a 3-year-old sibling was hit in the torso, Davis said. Their mother grabbed the children after the shooting and rushed them into the hospital for treatment, he said. Police were searching for the suspect, who was driving a dark-colored sedan when he drove up to the woman and her two children and opened fire, police said.

392,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/BINzAiHD2xY/,"The relentless news cycle lurched through the holidays, with an ongoing government shutdown and President Donald Trump's decision to suddenly pull troops from Syria in an apparent break with US allies. Nevertheless, there are reasons to have hope about the future of politics. Newsweek assembled the thoughts of former and future lawmakers and writers about why the American public shouldn't despair and where to go from here. Author Irshad Manji noted that media producers prioritize negative stories, and cautions that there needs to be more balance. “We in the media—because of our own need for eyeballs and clicks and profits—we’re not telling the healing stories,” said Manji. “We’re telling the stories of the conflicts. We need to hear both.” What follows are testimonials by Barack Obama, Stacy Abrams and others on how to actually make America great again, as Donald Trump has famously promised. Obama starts off, drawing inspiration from Robert F. Kennedy. ""Robert F. Kennedy knew a thing or two about hope,"" Obama writes.""Half a century ago, it was hope in the future, hope in people, hope in our capacity to do better, to be better, that spurred him to challenge a sitting president of his own party and challenge the conscience of a nation."" The 44th president observes that the world seemed steeped in chaos in the 1960s but Kennedy still projected hope. ""And through steel towns and crowded housing projects and windswept Native American reservations, Bobby reinvigorated an American spirit that was bruised and battered and still reeling from assassinations and riots and protests—and hatred,"" Obama notes. Obama singles out the qualities that allowed Kennedy to make Americans hopeful for the future. ""He argued for unity over division, for compassion over mutual suspicion, for justice over intolerance and inequality."" Obama then looks to hopeful developments in our current moment, like the activism of the Parkland students. ""It hasn’t even been a year since a mass shooting stole 17 lives at their school, but less than a month later those students had helped to raise the age to buy a rifle in Florida,"" Obama writes. ""They’d lengthened waiting periods before purchase. A couple of weeks after that, they’d inspired hundreds of thousands to march in the nation’s capital and all across the country. And, of course, they haven’t won every battle, but online, in the media, in the streets, on college campuses, they have become some of our most eloquent, effective voices against gun violence, he says ""And they are just getting started. Who knows what they’re going to do once they can actually rent a car?"" ""Ripples of hope. That’s the legacy, that’s the spirit, that Bobby Kennedy captured, standing on top of a beat-up car 50 years ago,"" he continues. ""Those are the ­descendants of the men and women and children who reached up into the sky, trying to get a touch of hope."" Stacy Abrams, who came close to becoming the first black female governor in America, writes that she's driven by the singular need to eradicate poverty. ""What do I want? Why do I want it? And how do I get it? My primary goal is to eradicate poverty; I believe it is immoral and a stain on our society,"" Abrams says. ""And so when I despair or get angry, I take the time to think about how I can best achieve that goal—and then I get to work."" She slams politicians who sow fear to get elected and says that instead, diversity should be celebrated. ""Too often, our fear is sowed from an idea that our diversity is a weapon or a weakness. We must instead realize that our diversity is our strength; it allows America to be the rich and enterprising nation we are,"" Abrams writes. Joe Kennedy III, grandson of Robert Kennedy, also speaks about fear. ""I wish it were easy to change human nature. Fear motivates, but hope does too,"" Kennedy writes. He points to the example of Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) who's persevered despite severe discrimination and violence. ""There is not an elected official who has been let down more often by people than he has—people who should know better and have his best interests at heart,"" Kennedy writes. ""He’s been arrested over 40 times and beaten and nearly killed. Yet he has lived, seen, fought and bled for the ability of the United States to change and become a more perfect union. There is value in that fight and pursuit."" The writer Irshad Manji dares readers to not instantly deride perceived ideological enemies. ""True story: A young hip-hop artist from Biloxi, Mississippi, wants the stars and bars in her state flag replaced by an inclusive and unifying design,"" Manji writes. ""She invites a supporter of the Confederate battle flag to her home, where they discuss his perspective. Soon after, he realizes that he cares more about defending her dignity than about preserving a symbol. He then stops flying his own Confederate battle flag. What sparked the transformation? Respect. The activist respected the flag-waver enough to engage rather than label him."" ""Here’s a courageous exercise that more of us could turn into a concrete habit: When you’re being disagreed with, ask not how you can change the other person’s mind; ask what you’re missing about the other person,"" she concludes. Other perspectives on hope come from actor and activist Don Cheadle, conservative writer Ben Shapiro, and historical Jill LePore. Read here. Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America, GOP Rep.

393,https://www.thedailybeast.com/alabama-mall-shooting-shows-again-that-theres-no-second-amendment-for-black-men,"SEARCH Somehow when the good guy with a gun is black, like EJ Bradford, police all too often perceive a threat—and respond to it with deadly force. Contributing Editor They shot him in the back. According to an independent forensic examination commissioned by the family of Emantic “EJ” Bradford, Jr., the 21-year-old was shot three times from behind—in the head, neck and back. And then, they lied. They said the former Army private had been involved in a Thanksgiving night shooting at a suburban Birmingham mall. They said he was the same man who got into a fight on the second floor and was suspected of firing the shots that wounded an 18-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl. Just before 10 p.m., “one man pulled a gun and shot the other twice in the torso” near the entrance of Foot Action, a popular sneaker store, reported a local ABC station, citing an account offered by the Hoover police department.” First, police claimed that a responding officer shot and killed EJ, the man they said was responsible for the bloodshed, within seconds of the shooting. They said EJ, who was armed, was running away from the scene when Hoover, Ala. officers encountered him. They portrayed their officers as heroes who acted quickly to “take out the threat,” according to the Montgomery Advertiser. But a day later, law enforcement officials revealed that a second gun had been found in the mall and they were forced to admit that EJ was not the shooter. His gun was cold and had never been fired that night. They remained convinced, they said in a press conference, that the former soldier  was still somehow involved in the incident. ABC pasted a note atop the previous day’s story: “UPDATE (11/24): According to a release from the Hoover Police Department, new evidence suggests that EJ Fitzgerald Bradford, who was shot and killed by officers, may have been involved in the original altercation, but he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old.” That was also a lie. (The police will say now that they were responding to information as it came in, but when that information always ends up putting the person the police shot in the worst possible light, the word “lie” applies.) Witnesses say the two undercover officers never identified themselves, nor did they give any orders to anyone, before one of them fired the fatal shots. Though he was licensed to carry, witnesses say EJ never produced his weapon. He never threatened anyone. Yet, Hoover police released a statement the following Monday saying EJ “had a gun in his hand” and that “Mr. Bradford brandished a gun.” Brandish, Webster’s Second tells me, means “To shake or wave (a weapon), usually menacingly.” Witnesses who contacted the family’s attorney dispute that account and believe mall surveillance and police body camera video will prove the weapon was found still attached to his pants. Undisputed is the fact that, despite EJ carrying identification, Hoover police did not notify his family for hours and left  his body in public view for some of that time. His parents  did not receive confirmation of their son’s death until his father, a former corrections officer battling cancer, contacted a Hoover police detective around 5 a.m. Friday morning. EJ, they were told, had shot two people at the Riverchase Galleria mall before he was killed by officers on the scene. Yet, according to witnesses, EJ did everything right. He was trying to help other shoppers get away. He was a law-abiding citizen who had a concealed carry permit and, thus, the legal right to have a gun in his possession at the mall. Within days, after the official story had unraveled and protesters took to the streets, Alabama state law enforcement tracked down the man they now say was the real shooter. Why was EJ Bradford shot? A police officer “saw a black man with a gun and he made his determination he must be a criminal,” the family attorney—who previously represented the families of  shooting victims Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown—said in a press conference. I am a gun owner and have been for the better part of my adult life. I gave up carrying a few years ago, in the wake of a high-profile mass shooting. Recently, however, I made the decision to purchase a new gun when I became concerned about my personal security. While my family’s safety was the deciding factor, I am mindful of the inherent risks that come with being black and owning a gun. By the time I am seen as “a good guy” it may well be too late. State and federal firearms laws will do little to protect me from an officer who sees me a threat and the statistics say a jury will almost certainly agree, if things even get that far. For us, the Second Amendment all too often does not apply. In mid-November, a suburban Chicago police officer killed a black security guard who was attempting to detain someone involved in a fight at a bar. Jemel Roberson, who had a gun, was wearing gear that plainly identified him as a guard. “Everybody was screaming out, ‘Security!’,” witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV. Responding officers ignored them. We know that 12-year-old Tamir Rice will never come home again. A Cleveland police officer shot him in a public park where he had been seen playing with a toy gun. Given no time to respond to commands (if any were made at all), Tamir was shot within seconds of the officer exiting his squad car by a cop who had been previously ruled unfit for duty by a neighboring police department. We know that the Second Amendment did not protect Philando Castile, who was shot by an officer in Minnesota, even though he told the officer that there was a gun in the car. Officer Jeronimo Yanez said he had “no choice.” Castile was killed as he reached for his identification. A jury acquitted Yanez of manslaughter. Then there was John Crawford III, who picked up a toy gun in an Ohio Walmart. He had threatened no one. There was no inciting incident. “Police said Crawford, who was 22, didn't obey commands to drop what they learned later was an air rifle he was carrying from a store shelf,” according to NBC News, despite video showing Crawford was shot immediately when officers entered the aisle. No one was ever charged in his killing. After the Alabama shooting, the National Rifle Association—a group that pays and publicly touts several prominent black spokespersons—said what it does after nearly every incident involving police shooting a black man with a legal weapon: nothing. Writing in The Atlantic, Adam Serwer named it The Rice Rule: There are no circumstances in which the responsibility for a police shooting of an unarmed black person cannot be placed on the victim. The same applies, of course, to an armed black person. “I did not want to see pictures of my son laying in a pool of blood and when I accidentally came across it I broke down,” said Bradford’s mother, April Pipkins, who stumbled across the horrific image as it circulated online and who has said that she believes she son would still be alive if he had been white. “And I can’t get it out of my head. I cannot get the scene out of my head of my child laying there, nobody around him trying to help him, just laying like a piece of trash where everyone can walk around and parade and post pictures of him on social media.” Hoover city officials—including the mayor and police chief—apologized to the family in a private meeting the following Tuesday. They offered their sympathies and said they were sorry for publicly misidentifying EJ as the shooter, but not for shooting him. After all, he was carrying a gun. Because he had a gun, they said, EJ was “heightening” the threat and thus culpable in his own death—after they shot him three times in the back.",2018-12-06 10:26:52,"Alabama Mall Shooting Shows, Again, That There‘s No Second Amendment for Black Men","blacks,police,crime and criminals,demonstrations and riots,murders and attempted murders,police brutality and misconduct,attacks on police",1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

The Daily Stormer — a major online hub for racists and anti-Semites that has followers who have committed mass murder — has been telling its readers to join the National Rifle Association, as the neo-Nazis who run the website see a successful NRA as their best possible hope to see Jewish people subjected to another Holocaust. The Daily Stormer has been very pleased with the NRA’s hard-line messaging in the Trump era: As the neo-Nazi website itself notes, the NRA frequently singles out Jews as its political enemies and refuses to condemn anti-Semitic actions taken by members of its leadership. A February 2017 Daily Stormer article explained, “There is basically zero chance that [NRA leader Wayne] LaPierre and others in the top ranks of the NRA aren’t aware of the Jewish issue, especially as it relates to the second amendment. They’ve remained silent on this topic until now, scared of the media power that the Jews possess. But things are changing.” The Daily Stormer has frequently promoted NRA membership drives, including repeatedly linking to an NRA recruitment website and claiming,“The number 1 source of new recruits for the NRA has always been the Daily Stormer.” In articles posted on the website, Daily Stormer writers implore readers to join the NRA:  According to The Daily Stormer, “The NRA is the country’s premiere pro-white and anti-Semitic organization. In fact, it is the only right-wing group of any kind in this country to have any success at all in the last 50 years.” The Daily Stormer clearly sees the NRA as a tool it can use to instigate wide-scale attacks against Jewish people. Here are a few pro-NRA threatening messages the site has posted: The Daily Stormer also posted a meme featuring NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch to threaten, “Our patience has its limits,” writing, “And guess what kikes? Your outrage machine is broken.”  Following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, The Daily Stormer backed the NRA’s calls for arming teachers, writing: The Daily Stormer is endorsing a plan to take it a step further, and arm the students as well. Say you’re in class, the teacher is writing something on the board, and a Jew pulls out a gun. The teacher has his back to the class and doesn’t see the Jew make his move – but you’re sitting behind him, and you’ve got a clean shot – why shouldn’t you be allowed to take it? The Daily Stormer is particularly enamored of five high-profile NRA employees: Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre, President Oliver North, national spokesperson Dana Loesch, NRATV host Chuck Holton, and NRA board member Ted Nugent. The Daily Stormer has labeled LaPierre “/ourlad/” and “Reichsmarschall,” the highest military rank in Nazi Germany, and favorably called the NRA leader an “anti-Semitic white nationalist.” In particular, the site likes LaPierre because of a speech he gave after the Parkland school shooting in which he called opponents of the NRA “European-style socialists,” which, as The Daily Stormer explained, “everyone acknowledges, means ‘Jews’” or “the gun-grabbing kikes.” The Daily Stormer has favorably mentioned that LaPierre “gave a speech calling out the Jews as gun grabbers,” noted that LaPierre “purposefully pushed for an open war with the Jews,” and written that “he literally put out a Jew list, showing that everyone who disagrees with gun rights is a Jew. And he has to know, too. There is no way you list off a dozen Jews – and not a single goy – without noticing that pattern.” Indeed, LaPierre has frequently targeted Jews during his public remarks. In May, The Daily Stormer heaped praise on North after he became president of the NRA. An article on the neo-Nazi website argued, “The NRA just made a great pick for their new head. Great, great pick.” The website described North’s involvement in the Iran-Contra arms trafficking scandal as a positive, writing, “This is one guy who definitely does not give a single fuck about having a license to buy and sell weapons. For those who don’t know – the Iran-Contra ‘scandal’ was a program of selling weapons to Iran and using the money from that to fund communist-killing death squads in Latin America.” The article speculated that as president of the NRA, North could help arm Iran with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that the country could then use against Israel. The Daily Stormer also has a lot of praise for NRA national spokesperson Loesch, whom it calls “Princess Dana.” The site praised the gun group for not firing Loesch for her recently resurfaced 2010 tweet that said, “I bet Rick Sanchez was fired by a Jew.” (Sanchez was fired from CNN after he made anti-Semitic remarks about comedian Jon Stewart.) Loesch said that her tweet was meant to be an appeal to poetic justice. The Daily Stormer wrote that instead of firing her, the NRA “doubled-down by giving her a show about how she is going to destroy the Jews,” referencing promotional material for her NRATV show Relentless in which Loesch has threatened members of the media that their “time is running out.” The Daily Stormer has also praised Chuck Holton, a correspondent for the NRA’s media operation NRATV. During a July 2017 appearance on NRATV, Holton suggested that Black people were poised to commit mass rape and murder against white people while referencing “what’s happening in South Africa.” In response, The Daily Stormer wrote, “Holy shit! The NRA cited the White Genocide in South Africa as a warning to America!” Holton has a lengthy history of promoting white nationalism and making racist comments, and he has repeatedly pushed the conspiracy theory that Jewish philanthropist George Soros is behind the migrant caravan traveling through Central America and Mexico — a remarkably similar theory to the one that inspired a gunman to carry out an anti-Semitic massacre at a Pittsburgh, PA, synagogue in October. The site is aware of NRATV and has disturbingly noted, “A NRA tv channel calling out ‘socialist corruption’ 24/7 would be the best thing ever, especially considering that all of these ‘European-style socialists’ are actually Jews.” (Three months after that Daily Stormer article was published and a day after an ISIS terror attack in Manchester, U.K., Holton argued on NRATV that “this wave of violence that we’re seeing across Europe is a symptom of the broader problem of multiculturalism and socialism.”) The Daily Stormer also lauded NRA board member Ted Nugent for sharing an anti-Semitic meme on Facebook without repercussions from the NRA, writing, “I’ve gotta give it to Ted. I expected an apology within hours. Instead he is just straight trolling these Jews. It’s fantastic.” In February, a Daily Stormer article defending the NRA as a friendly home for anti-Semites brought up the incident: “Remember another NRA spokesperson, Ted Nugent, posted that one meme a couple years ago… So, the NRA knows and the Jews know the NRA knows, and both sides want to escalate that.” The NRA’s recent adoption of more extreme messaging tactics is not lost on The Daily Stormer. As the neo-Nazis who run the website cheered in a March article, “The NRA is done with euphemisms.”  Know first. The opinions that matter. Delivered to your inbox every morning Michael Flynn Former Trump administration National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has made more than his fair share of disturbing, jaw-dropping remarks-- like telling the former guy he should impose martial law to hold a new election or suggesting a Myanmar-like coup at a QAnon conference in May. But he seemed to reach a new low when he joked about using a newly gifted assault rifle to carry out an assassination in the nation's capital. ""We were trying to come up with a rifle that we thought was appropriate for a general, so we went with an old-school Woodland camouflage...one of our top-quality guns,"" said Jason Parker, a gun company employee who gifted the weapon to Flynn.

396,https://www.theblaze.com/conservative-review/islamists-in-pittsburgh-pocket-cash-raised-for-jewish-community-in-wake-of-mass-shooting,"Update: On November 28, one day following the publication of this article, Celebrate Mercy posted two letters from the Tree of Life Synagogue. One letter acknowledged a gift of $155,000 received on November 21. The second letter (at the same link) acknowledged a gift of $84,534, also received on November 21. This accounts for 100 percent of the funds raised for the shooting victims through the crowdfunding site.  However, the November 21 date in the letter for the $84,534 gift contradicts the several statements Celebrate Mercy founder Tarek El-Messidi made to The Forward in an article dated November 25, in which he claimed that he still had possession of funds raised for the Pittsburgh shooting victims in excess of $155,000. “I don’t want it to drag out too long, but I don’t want to do, here’s $100 here, $200 there,” El-Messidi told The Forward. “I’d rather it be dispersed [sic] quickly so we can focus on a lot of other work we have to do.” The Forward reported that he was “brainstorming what exactly to do with the remaining $83,000.” The November 21 date also contradicts a statement posted by Celebrate Mercy on the crowdfunding website on November 28, which claims that on that day, November 28 and not November 21, the non-profit sent the remaining $84,534 to the Islamic Center. “This afternoon, we transferred the additional funds raised ($84,534) to the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh for them to deliver to the Tree of Life synagogue,” Celebrate Mercy wrote on its crowdfunding site on November 28 at 2 p.m. Eastern time. There is also an additional agreement, dated November 28, after CR’s article, indicating that an additional $84,534 gift will be disbursed to Tree of Life. On November 29, Facebook partner and fact-checking website Snopes claimed that Conservative Review, among other sites, misled its audience in this report. “The Islamic Center of Pittsburgh gave two separate checks, for $155,000 and $84,534, to the Tree of Life synagogue on 21 November, six days before the articles were posted,” Snopes writes, claiming that CR “grossly misrepresented the facts”. But the available paper trail, other than the date of gift in the letter, indicates that the $84,534 payment was made after the initial report in The Forward and after CR’s article. As stated above, there was zero public evidence that the $84,534 was sent to the Tree of Life synagogue prior to November 28 at 2 p.m. Eastern time. In fact, as shown above, at time of publication, there were several reasons to believe, based on El-Messidi’s own words to The Forward, that he was still in possession of the extra cash raised over $155,000. The Snopes story did not report that El-Messidi appeared to claim multiple times that he was in possession of the funds, along with the November 28 statement from Celebrate Mercy’s fundraising site. Corrections: Conservative Review initially reported that ""hundreds of thousands of dollars” were not accounted for. That amount should have been only approximately $84,000. Our original article stated that the link to a document showing an agreement for the disbursement of the first $155,000 was dead. The link we tried at the time of publication was dead; however, here is the live link to that agreement. CR regrets the error. Though it appears that document concerning the $155,000 was available online at time of publication, no documents related to the $84,534 amount were available at the time of publication, despite the date of the gift listed in the acknowledgement letter from Tree of Life. The agreement concerning the $84,534 and the letter of acknowledgement are dated November 28. The original headline, ""Islamists in Pittsburgh pocket cash raised for Jewish community in wake of mass shooting,"" has been amended to reflect that all funds in question have now been accounted for.
