(AP Photo/Steven Senne)  Steven Senne FOXBOROUGH — New England Patriots defensive end Lawrence Guy is familiar with trials on the football field. During his seven-year NFL career, the 27-year-old bounced around four other teams before landing in New England as a free agent this offseason. But his football journey has also intersected with a pair of life-altering tragedies. Last year Guy was is his second full season with the Baltimore Ravens when he and his wife lost a baby to a miscarriage during the fifth month of pregnancy. Then, last month he was blindsided again by news that his hometown of Las Vegas was the site of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. On Sunday, Guy will honor the 59 killed and more than 500 injured in the Vegas attack during the NFL’s My Cause, My Cleats initiative. He’s also wearing a cleat for Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep, an organization that helped him and his wife heal from the loss of their unborn child. Guy is one of 14 Patriots who will be wearing specialized cleats in the second year of the NFL-wide event, aimed at highlighting the various organizations players want to bring awareness to. After the games, fans can bid on the one-of-a-kind cleats, with all proceeds going back to players’ various charities. Guy said the Vegas shooting still haunts him. “It hit home. I had family at the concert. I had family that were staying at the hotel that week,” he said. “It just hurts. ... You think about the families that are there enjoying themselves that got hit with the horrible news that night or that morning. It’s gonna constantly affect me, and affect the families that were involved in that.” The centerpiece of Guy’s Las Vegas cleat is a reimagined representation of the city’s iconic red, white and blue “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign. In the depiction Guy will be wearing on his right foot, “Welcome” has been replaced by “Unity.” The rest of the sign reads: “Forever Vegas Strong.” At the bottom is “10-1-17,” the date of the shooting. The left cleat he will be wearing is just as meaningful. Guy and his wife, Andrea, had been married less than a year when she became pregnant. Guy was in the middle of offseason workouts when she had just passed the five-month mark. That’s when she suffered a miscarriage. “We didn’t know about the organization at that time — we kept it silent. We were dealing with it our own way at home,” he recalled. “It’s one of those stigmas that you want to keep to yourself. You don’t want to share.” Connecting with Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep helped them see that they weren’t alone and that there was an outlet to help them cope. Guy and his wife have since gotten matching wrist tattoos of angel wings and halo for the daughter they named Estelle. “There are resources out there to help you heal from that process,” Guy said. As he trudges forward off the field, Guy is also making the most of his latest opportunity on it. Since signing a four-year $13.4 million deal this offseason, Guy has been one of the most consistent players on New England’s battered defensive line. He’s started 10 of 11 games this season, making 21 tackles. Coach Bill Belichick praised Guy after the Patriots’ win over Miami. Defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said he’s improved throughout the season. “He’s got great energy about him,” Patricia said. “He’s smart, he learns, he studies the game, he’s got a lot of insight, too, from a player that’s been able to do this for a couple years.” It’s why Guy said he’s never allowed himself to be too discouraged despite his multiple stops around the league. “Never that. You can’t give up on your dream,” he said. “There’s ups and downs in this business. ... I’m not that person that’s gonna give up. I put my mind to it and said I’m gonna continue to fight for what I believe in.” It’s also why Guy said he wouldn’t change anything about his personal journey — both tragedies and triumphs. “The person I am today is because of what I went through. I’d have been a whole different person if I didn’t go through it,” he said. “That’s one of those questions ‘Can you change things in your life that made you who you are?’ You can’t. Because you don’t know who you are until certain things happen. Things happened that made me who I am today and I’m grateful that I am the person I am.” KANO, Nigeria — Armed kidnappers in Nigeria have released 28 of the more than 120 students who were abducted at the beginning of July from the...

The Cubs seem certain to move at least some of their big names in the coming week This weekend, we learned that several teams have scouts in attendance at Wrigley Field for the series between the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks. For all we know, Anthony Rizzo’s Chicago Cubs tenure is entering its final week. But given Rizzo’s recent cold spell, Jed Hoyer could have his hands full getting a return that will satiate a fan base that loves the three-time All-Star first baseman. The Cubs are about to trade Kris Bryant, and no single career illustrates the sea change in baseball's treatment of star players like his iconic, then sour tenure in Chicago. Chicago Cubs left-handed pitcher Brad Wieck underwent a cardiac ablation procedure in February 2020 and was placed on the injured list July 9 with an irregular heartbeat. Everyone loves to talk about the sexy trades. The Kris Bryant, Javier Baez, Craig Kimbrel tend to dominate the Chicago Cubs rumors scene – especially right now. Sogard, 35, signed a minor-league deal over the winter but has made his way into 78 games with the Cubs and tallied 180 plate appearances. Jed Hoyer has been perfectly transparent that his efforts before the trade deadline will be focused on selling rather than buying. With this in mind, Chicago Cubs fans should not be expecting a huge splash in the coming days regarding the top arms available via trade this season. For literal years, we’ve all wondered what these post-2016 Chicago Cubs teams might look like with a legitimate replacement for Dexter Fowler atop the order, setting the table for guys like Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo and Javier Baez. When Ben Zobrist took a personal leave of absence from the Chicago Cubs in early May 2019 as details of marital trouble emerged, I don’t think anyone thought The Chicago Cubs are poised to sell at the trade deadline for the first time in years, and with a number of core pieces headed for free agency at the end of the season, a full-blown fire sale is not out of the question... For a team to be set up for success, it must have a strong farm system behind it. We saw what happened in 2016. Theo Epstein got the Chicago Cubs their first ring in 108 years. Yes, the Chicago Cubs are in action again Wednesday, but the only story on anyone’s mind is the upcoming trade deadline and the endless stream of Cubs rumors. Man, Jim Bowden ponders trade deadline possibilities and hot stove wheeling and dealing the same way I run a franchise on MLB The Show. No holds barred, anything goes. We’re only nine days away from the trade deadline and the Chicago Cubs are firmly in the driver’s seat of the seller’s market. The team has two of the The time is coming for some serious decision making in the Chicago Cubs front office. By now we’ve all heard the rumors, we know the speculation. This team is going to be sellers at the end of the month. At this point, nothing we’re hearing on the Kris Bryant rumors front is necessarily surprising. The latest from Jeff Passan, though, still hurt, with him saying the Chicago Cubs All-Star is ‘as good as gone’ with 10 days till the trade deadline. The ever-widening gap between the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago Cubs in the National League Central has grown to chasmic proportions, with David Ross’ club falling 9 1/2 games out following Monday’s disheartening loss to St. Here we are. July 20. 10 days before the annual MLB trade deadline. The Chicago Cubs find themselves in somewhat of a bind before the trade deadline regarding their star shortstop, Javier Baez. The Mets have seen their lead in the NL East shrink and may look for some big upgrades for the stretch push. The Chicago Cubs will be sellers at the MLB trade deadline, and Kris Bryant will likely be playing elsewhere on July 31. Teams such as the Mets, Giants and Brewers could use him, and here are realistic scenarios for the bunch. The Cubs have come to terms with nearly all of their top picks, the club announced. Among their draftees in the top 10 rounds, only second-rounder James Triantos, a third baseman from a Virginia high school, has yet to put pen to paper. The Chicago Cubs are expected to be very busy in the month of July prior to the Major League Baseball trade deadline. On Thursday, before the MLB season Baez and Rizzo, both key contributors to the 2016 World Series-winning team, are set to become free agents after the 2021 campaign. The Chicago Cubs have been flirting with the idea of trading Kris Bryant since the offseason, and the New York Mets are said to have maintained interest in the star third baseman. The Braves are 44-45 this season but four games back of the Mets in the weak NL East. That likely explains why they tried to get someone who might be able to provide some pop. Arrieta has compiled an 8.55 ERA in his past 12 outings. On the season, he is 5-9 across 17 starts with a 6.30 ERA and 1.641 WHIP. The Cubs have lost 10 in a row. Sogard has pitched three times during the losing streak. The Chicago Cubs blanked the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-0 on Thursday, and in the process four Cubs pitchers combined for a no-hitter. This was a historic no-hitter as it was the seventh no-hitter of the 2021 Major League Baseball season, and ties the Major League Baseball modern-day record for most no-hitters in a season.

From inside a 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, a male gunman fired below into the audience of the Route 91 Harvest Festival, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more before shooting himself dead. It marked the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Dion appeared in a video recorded in October at one of her concerts in Caesars Palace's Colosseum, saying, ""We dedicate tonight's show to all the victims and their families and to the first responders and to the doctors and nurses who are working around the clock to save lives. And to so many heroes who did whatever they could to help complete strangers at a time of desperate needs."" All proceeds from the concert are set to go to the Vegas Shooting Victims Fund. Dion had also donated the proceeds from her own show to the shooting survivors. The singer appears in a prerecorded videotaped message that paid tribute to the victims of the Oct. 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. It was filmed at one of her concerts in the city that took place days after the tragedy. The group performed ""Motownphilly"" and an a capella version of ""It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday."" ""Today, more than ever, I am proud to be from this city. Music shows that there is nothing that should divide us. Tonight, we are one. We are Vegas Strong,"" the frontman told the crowd. The band played songs such as ""Whatever It Takes"" and ""Believer"" before initiating a moment of silence to honor the victims of the Oct. 1, 2017 Las Vegas shooting. At the end of their set, the crowd stood to sing along with ""On Top of the World"" and ""Radioactive."" The veteran Vegas performer introduces a videotaped appearance by Elton John. Artists from the Mystère show pose for a photo. The Las Vegas native and Washington Nationals 2015 National League MVP thanked the first responders and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and hospital staff. In November, Dion had appeared in person at a smaller Vegas Strong Benefit Concert at the OMNIA Nightclub in Caesars Palace, where she joined DJ Steve Aoki to perform a special version of her hit ballad ""My Heart Will Go On."" Jason Aldean also appeared at Friday's Vegas Strong Benefit Concert via videotaped message. He told the crowd, ""Be louder than the bad guys,"" according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He said he couldn't be there in person because his wife is due to give birth, the outlet reported. Brittany Aldean  welcomed their first child, a boy, that night. Aldean is one of the survivors of the shooting, which took place while the country star was performing onstage at the Route 91 Harvest music festival. Aldean was unhurt. At the Vegas Strong Benefit Concert on Friday, Imagine Dragons and The Killers performed onstage separately and also performed Elvis Presley's ""Viva Las Vegas"" together along with other acts, marking the first time the bands, who both formed in Las Vegas, have shared a stage. ""Today, more than ever, I am proud to be from this city,"" Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds said. ""Music shows that there is nothing that should divide us. Tonight, we are one. We are Vegas Strong."" The Killers performed ""Be Still"" while the names of the people killed in the shooting were displayed on the screen. The band closed the show with hits such as ""When You Were Young"" and ""Somebody Told Me."" ""There's enough love in this room tonight to light up Las Vegas,"" singer Brandon Flowers said. There were also live performances from the likes of Penn & Teller, David Copperfield, Blue Man Group, Cirque du Soleil and Boyz II Men, who told the crowd, ""This show is a testament to how strong Las Vegas really is.""

By John Woodrow Cox | Washington Post LAS VEGAS — The varsity cheerleaders had just finished practice when Natalia Baca stepped out into the school parking lot and spotted a tall, dark-haired teenager holding a bouquet of multicolored sunflowers. “Will you go to homecoming with me?” he said as she approached with her identical twin, Gianna, who had helped orchestrate the moment. Natalia pressed both hands against her cheeks and grinned, because no one had ever asked her to the dance before. “Yes,” Natalia answered, already imagining what she would look like in her open-back, iridescent white dress that flashed shades of pink and blue in the sunlight. They hugged and talked for a few minutes before she and Gianna had to go. The seniors, age 17, were running late for a country music concert. The Las Vegas sun had long faded beneath a distant mountain range on that first day in October, so the twins hurried back inside Faith Lutheran High to change clothes. Jason Aldean, Natalia’s favorite singer, was scheduled to perform the final set at that weekend’s Route 91 Harvest festival. Reading this on your phone?

It was a Sunday, a school night, so most people in the crowd of 22,000 would be adults, but some kids would be there, too, including 10 students from Faith, a private Christian academy in an affluent community of gated neighborhoods nine miles west of the Strip. And in that evening’s earliest moments, before the gunman high above them pulled the trigger, the twins and their classmates were eager for the week ahead — first the music, then the homecoming dress-up days, the silly lip-sync competition, the pep rally, the football game and, at last, on Saturday, the dance. About the time Natalia said yes in the parking lot, Faith juniors Shae Turner and Delaney Sylvester settled in 50 yards from the stage, right of the catwalk, on the side nearest Las Vegas Boulevard and the Mandalay Bay Resort. The morning before, Shae had posted a photo to Instagram from Friday night. In it, the two girls each posed with one hand positioned on a hip so their purple festival bracelets, that weekend’s status symbol, would be in view. The best friends, both in brown cowboy boots, stood with their backs to the neon-lit stage, eyes bright and smiles radiant. They’d each turned 17 just weeks before. Beneath the image, Shae wrote a caption: “country music makes us happy #route91.” For seven months, she had looked forward to this weekend. “Happy early Birthday present,” her mom had texted March 3 with an image of the ticket confirmation. “OMG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!” Shae wrote back, with four heart emoji. “I’m freaking out… like on the verge of tears thank you!” The girls planned for weeks what they would wear to the festival and during homecoming week. Shae — the daughter of two FBI agents who had inherited her parents’ attention to detail – narrowed her Route 91 outfit options to seven before she texted photos to Delaney and they cut it down to three. They went to Forever 21 in a mall on the Strip to pick up yellow skirts and shirts for the school’s “Color Day” — “Nobody owns yellow,” Shae, the junior class treasurer, had unsuccessfully argued to her fellow student council members. At Delaney’s prodding, Shae picked a pair of four-inch floral Steve Madden heels for the dance that, by the time they headed to the register, she adored. For the festival weekend, Shae’s mom, Elena Turner, rented a room and stayed with the girls through Sunday morning at the Delano hotel, next to Mandalay Bay, so they wouldn’t have to drive home after each evening’s performances. In the lobby, before they headed to Route 91’s opening night, Elena gave them one last reminder. “If there’s an active shooter in the crowd,” she began, and Shae knew what came next. She’d been hearing that speech from her parents, who had met during their FBI training, for at least five years, ever since a movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., left 12 people dead. “Run until you can’t run,” Elena continued. “Hide until you can’t hide. Fight until you can’t fight.” Her daughter smiled. “Mom, don’t worry,” Shae said. “Everything will be fine.” Marie Langer’s mother, Susan, assumed everything would be fine, too. It was, after all, a country music festival, filled with people who’d come to take a break from their problems, not start any. Her daughter, also a Faith junior, had raved all weekend about how friendly the other concertgoers were. Determined to see Aldean up close, Marie had valeted her 2016 white Ford Mustang at Mandalay Bay at 2:30 that Sunday afternoon and walked over to the festival site a half-hour before the first band went on the main stage. She and a classmate, Summer Stadtlander, both 16, were so giddy that, on their way, they’d skipped together up Las Vegas Boulevard. Summer had texted Marie that morning, saying she’d just listened to “so much jason aldean and I’m so excited now.” “ME TOO,” Marie responded. Then: “IM EXCITED TO BE FRONT ROW.” Then: “AND TOUCH HIM.” Marie, an accomplished equestrian show jumper, had twice traveled to Europe and was a veteran of superstar concerts – Rihanna, Drake, Nicki Minaj – but something about Aldean’s simple, Georgia-bred twang always made her feel good. She had followed his tour schedule for two years, hoping to hear him in person, before her chance finally came that Sunday. The 15-acre venue was mostly empty when the girls arrived, giving them their choice of places to stand along a railing that lined the catwalk. “Should we go on the right side today?” Marie asked, but Summer suggested they stick with the left, near where the friends had stood both previous nights. They normally did homework on Sundays but wanted no distractions on this one. Before they got there, Marie had already finished her American Revolution reading guides and Summer her Algebra II assignment. At 4:50 p.m., Marie — whose fingernails were painted paisley and plaid, because that was the most country design she could think of — sent her mom a photo of a guitar pick she’d caught when a member of the Josh Abbott Band tossed it out. Not long after, a stagehand gave her a copy of Big & Rich’s set list. “Oh my gosh,” Marie shrieked, bouncing up and down. At 7:51, her mom texted to ask who was playing. “Waiting for Jake Owen then Jason aldean,” Marie responded. “Be safe. We luv u tons.” “Luv u.” At 9:30, her mom sent a final message: “Call house phone uf emergency. Cell phone going off.” Then the lights went dark and the crowd roared as Marie pointed her phone’s camera to record Aldean’s entrance. His introduction video, a collage of mud, pickups and cowboy hats, appeared on a massive screen behind the stage. “The suspense right now is insane,” Marie told a girl standing next to her. In the crowd behind them, about 30 yards back and to the right, Natalia felt the same. She’d gotten a ticket for Sunday just hours earlier, delighting her not only because of Aldean but because Gianna would be there, too. She and her twin did almost everything together. It had been that way from the beginning, when the girls were born eight weeks premature and began their lives fighting to keep them. They’d never spent more than 48 hours apart. Now the sisters were sharing the first music festival they’d gone to without a parent, and Aldean was on stage, crooning about people tougher than they look. “They ain’t seen the blood, sweat and tears it took to live their dreams,” Natalia sang along as she danced with friends, and Gianna, a dozen feet away, did the same with her boyfriend. About 15 minutes into the set, a few others in their group told Natalia that they were heading to the bathrooms, in the back of the venue, and asked if she needed to go, too. She did, but refused to miss a single song. “I’ll just wait,” she said. “It’s okay.” She stayed, swaying and laughing until 10:05 p.m., when the sound of pops from somewhere faraway cut through the music. “Did you hear that?” she asked a friend. Maybe, she thought, someone had set off fireworks. Natalia peered up above the stage and into the night sky, searching for bursts of light. All she saw was darkness. — “Get down!” someone in the crowd shouted as Natalia watched Aldean rush offstage amid a second barrage. She dropped to her knees and covered her head. A friend, Kaitlyn Burton, 19, huddled alongside, clutching Natalia’s hands. “What’s happening?” Natalia asked, unaware that, just in front of where she was hunkered, a half dozen people had already collapsed to the turf, struck by bullets fired from Mandalay Bay’s 32nd floor, 400 yards away. Natalia looked up, trembling as she searched for Gianna in the chaotic,howling mass of bodies crouched and crawling around her. Her twin was nowhere in sight. “God, please help us,” she prayed, but now the wails grew louder, and the crackle drew closer. Then, suddenly, what felt like a steel medicine ball slammed into her right shoulder blade, striking with such force that she was shoved to the left, losing her grip on Kaitlyn’s hand. Natalia’s back stung, as though it had been lit ablaze. “Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!” she cried. The impact jolted her friend, too. Even before Kaitlyn saw the blood, she knew what that meant. “Natalia’s been shot,” she yelled at her boyfriend, Riley Van Buskirk, who until then had remained standing, frozen in shock. He stared down at the hole in Natalia’s back, then stripped off his long-sleeved denim Wrangler shirt and wrapped it diagonally around her chest and back, hoping it would apply enough pressure to slow the bleeding. As he helped her up, Riley felt the cracked bones along Natalia’s shoulders grind against each other. He feared what the bullet had done inside her. Overwhelmed, Natalia couldn’t process what was happening — the words that Kaitlyn had spoken or the burn now spreading from her back to her chest. And as she staggered to her feet, Natalia still didn’t see Gianna. Had her twin been shot, too? Then came more gunfire. “Run!” Kaitlyn hollered. At that moment, Shae, the daughter of the FBI agents, was already sprinting with her friend Delaney toward a row of outdoor beer vendors. When they reached them, the girls dove to the ground, cowering just beneath a purple billboard that overlooked Las Vegas Boulevard. “LIVE MUSIC,” it advertised, with an arrow pointing back toward the ongoing massacre behind them. Shae, who suspected it was gunfire as soon as she heard it, had immediately grabbed her friend’s arm and begun pushing through the crowd. She decided that fleeing toward the venue’s rear or east-side exits, along with thousands of other people, would leave the girls too exposed. Instead, Shae headed toward the nearest cover on the venue’s western edge. Now, with bullets spraying overhead, they were trapped. Shae pressed her cellphone against her ear. “Mom,” she said, “someone is shooting into the crowd.” “Are you sure?” asked Elena, who was in her bedroom, about to go to sleep. “Yes, I’m sure.” Then, what sounded to Elena’s trained ear like machine-gun fire exploded through the phone’s speaker. Stay calm, her mom told her. Stay calm. Elena, voice quavering, asked whether they could make it to Shae’s car, parked over the fence and across the street at Mandalay Bay. No, Shae said, because she thought the shots might be coming from that direction. The girls knew they had to make a choice: Stay put and risk a gunman finding them, or move and risk being sniped out in the open. Hands clutched, each promised to stay with the other, before Delaney, in a pause between salvos, suggested they keep going. The beer vendors were arranged in a semicircle that jutted out into the venue, so between bursts, they crept farther along, terrified of running into the end of a barrel around every bend. When they reached the far side, the girls realized that they were, again, trapped. A gate along the fence in front of them remained shut, and behind them, in the festival’s center, was nothing but uncovered space. “We can’t get out,” Shae told her mom. “There’s no exit.” Another blast of gunshots erupted. They looked for somewhere to hide, but this time, the space beneath the nearest canopy was already full. They couldn’t get in. The girls were exposed. “What do we even do?” asked Delaney, who’d begun to cry. Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from the Bay Area and beyond. It was then that a bald man who looked to be in his late 40s scrambled over, blanketing their bodies with his own. “Stay down,” the stranger said, as he placed his hand on Delaney’s head, pressing the American flag on her camouflage baseball cap against the pavement. And when that volley had subsided and the man had left, Delaney glanced back toward the fence. “Shae,” she said, “a gate opened up.” Up next to the stage, Marie and Summer, the other pair of Faith juniors, stood from where they’d ducked behind the catwalk, opposite Mandalay Bay, and darted toward an east exit. The girls, who’d both taken videos of the chaos by then, didn’t understand the moment’s gravity until they saw — sprawled across a bloodied landscape of plastic cups, crushed beer cans and trampled cowboy hats — the wounded and the dead. Marie’s eyes stayed on her cellphone as they rushed past. She didn’t have her home number saved, and as she tried to dial it, her hands wouldn’t stop shaking. “Marie, what’s wrong?” answered her mother, Susan. “There’s a shooting. There’s a shooting. Shooter, shooter,” she blurted, barely able to pronounce the words. “You have to stop. What are you saying?” Susan asked. Still on the phone with her mom, she and Summer escaped the venue and hurried across Giles Street, where they reached the edge of a church parking lot enclosed by a seven-foot-high wrought-iron fence. “What do we do?” the 16-year-olds askeda pair of police officers on the other side, strapping on what looked like riot gear. “You need to get over here right now,” one of them said. Marie set her phone down on the fence’s brick base, then put her cowboy boot on the edge and hiked up her floor-length lime-green dress. She and Summer gripped the metal bars and pulled themselves up and over, bruising the backs of their legs on spikes that lined the top. The girls leapt into the parking lot. Marie reached back for her cell. “My phone’s at 4 percent,” she told her mom. “I have to go.” Across the road, on the festival grounds, Riley and Kaitlyn had just helped Natalia into a white medical tent where the injured were being brought for treatment. She slumped onto a plastic chair. A passing medic asked how she was doing. OK, Natalia said, even though she wasn’t. For years, the teenager had wanted to be a nurse, to help people who were worse off than she was. And there they were, screaming and staggering all around her. Go to the others, she told the medic. A man sitting next to Natalia was pressing his palms together, as if in prayer, because the fingers on one of his hands had been blown off. She recognized a guy she’d known for years lying on a cot nearby. He’d been shot in the stomach. “I need help,” he said, and Riley called out for it, but no one came, because everyone needed help. On the pavement, where blood had begun to pool, Natalia saw a man to her right with a bullet wound on the back of his neck. She watched a small group crowd around him, pressing over and over on his chest. He didn’t move. “We lost him,” she heard someone say, and they left him alone. Now Natalia began to feel lightheaded, and Kaitlyn noticed her lips turning purple. “You need to stay with me,” her friend said. A medic suggested Natalia might need sugar. Riley grabbed her a Coke, and she sipped on it, struggling to keep her eyes open. Then the police arrived and, with the tent filling, they ordered anyone who wasn’t hurt to leave. Before she did, Kaitlyn leaned down, pressed both hands against her friend’s face and reminded Natalia of her twin. “Think about Gianna,” she pleaded. “She’s been with you her entire life. She couldn’t do anything without you.” The gunfire sounded louder – closer – than before, and now Marie was trembling, sobbing, hyperventilating. She and Summer had inched down the fence line and taken refuge with six or seven others behind a dark Ford pickup near the church parking lot’s entrance. The police continued to order people in their direction, north up Giles Street, which left both girls convinced that a gunman was on foot, making his way toward them. A short, blond woman held them both in her arms, trying to calm Marie. “What’s your name?” she asked. “Where do you go to school?” Marie, though, could barely speak. Out in the road, pickup after pickup pulled up as victims were piled into the beds. “Where’s the nearest hospital?” the girls heard people yell. The injured who didn’t reach the trucks were brought to paramedics gathering behind the 16-year-olds in the parking lot. “Honey, don’t look over there,” the woman told them. “Don’t do that to yourself.” A group brought over another woman, who was wearing only pants and a blood-soaked bra. Her face ashen, she didn’t say a word. “Her husband was shot,” one of the men explained. The relentless sights of carnage only intensified Marie’s fear that here, huddled behind a truck, her life could end. She peered back down the road, still waiting for a man with a rifle to appear in the night. One block west, in the pyramid-shaped Luxor on the other side of the festival grounds, Shae and Delaney hid in a bathroom, worried about the same thing. Shae’s parents were in their car, speeding toward the Strip, but they had remained on the phone with her. Their siren blaring in the background, she could hear them coordinating with other investigators already responding to the rampage. “If it’s a male shooter, he’s not going to go into the women’s restroom,” Shae’s dad had told her, so when they raced into the Luxor, the girls found one on the first floor and locked themselves in a handicapped stall. Shae sat with her back against the wall, leaning down to watch the door. A woman burst through, shrieking. Shae’s heart pounded. Had someone chased the woman there? Was the shooter in the hotel? She waited, hoping a man’s feet wouldn’t follow. None did, but she feared that the woman’s hysterics could draw a gunman’s attention. “Should I try to calm her down?” she asked her dad. “You can try,” he said. Shae opened the stall door and told the woman, who had been separated from a sister and a friend, that her parents worked for the FBI. The best thing for all of them to do, Shae said, was to stay calm. The woman stopped screaming. “It’s going to be okay,” Shae said, and the teenager hoped that was true. Back in the white tent, a medic, hands quivering, struggled unsuccessfully to insert an IV into Natalia’s right arm. Her friends were gone, but still lingering in her mind were Kaitlyn’s last words about Gianna, her missing twin. The girls looked so much alike that, for years, most people could only tell them apart by the scar on Natalia’s knee from a bicycle accident. “Mirror images,” their parents called them, because Natalia was right-handed and Gianna was left-handed. Her sister had to be all right, Natalia thought. She had to be. Then a man in shorts, a white T-shirt and a reversed baseball cap walked up. Dean McAuley, a 46-year-old firefighter down from Washington state for the festival, had just helped carry a young woman about Natalia’s age into the tent, but the pulse he’d detected when he found her on the ground had already disappeared. McAuley couldn’t bring her back. Maybe, though, he could do something for Natalia. He took a torn piece of blue shirt and tied it around her forearm, revealing a vein for the IV. He asked where she’d been shot. On her back shoulder, she told him. McAuley searched for an exit wound but couldn’t find one. His stomach knotted. The risk of severe internal bleeding, McAuley knew, was enormous. He checked her heartbeat and felt it racing. Her body was compensating for the shock, he suspected, but what would happen when that wore off? Ten minutes – that’s how long McAuley thought he had to save her life. “I’ll be right back,” he said. “Keep your eyes on me.” The firefighter found someone coordinating care in the tent. Just outside, McAuley was told, ambulances had gathered to take people to the hospital. He returned to Natalia and asked if she could stand. Yes, she said. He held her hand with one of his and her IV bag with the other. “There will be an ambulance waiting for us,” he told Natalia. When they got outside, none remained. The sound of gunshots had subsided by then, but McAuley could still hear frantic chatter blaring over first responders’ radios. “Active shooter.” “Multiple shooters.” He helped Natalia shuffle across Giles Street and into the same parking lot where Marie and Summer were sheltering. McAuley lowered her onto a lawn chair behind a white SUV. “What can I do for you?” he asked, taking a knee in front of her. “I want to call my parents,” Natalia said. He dialed. Her dad, Mike Baca, picked up. McAuley explained who he was and that he was with his daughter, who had been shot. “Is she alive?” Mike asked. McAuley gave her the phone. She said she couldn’t feel her legs. “Just breathe,” Mike told her, before he and his wife headed for their car. After hanging up, McAuley saw an older man jogging toward an Audi parked behind them. Reluctantly, he agreed to take them to a hospital. McAuley helped Natalia inside. He ordered the driver to turn on his hazard lights, find an ambulance and chase it. The man did, blowing through red lights along the way. In the back seat, Natalia told McAuley that her left arm had gone numb. She was struggling to breathe. “Do you have dogs?” he asked. Natalia said she had two, Kosmo and Vdara, both Boston terriers. He took out his phone and showed her a picture of Molly, his 100-pound Great Pyrenees. McAuley’s other hand moved to her wrist. At any second, he knew, Natalia’s pulse could plummet. He scrolled through photos of his wife and 5-year-old son. “You have a beautiful family,” she said. He asked about hers. Did she have any siblings? A twin, she said, who’d also been at the concert. “Do you know where she is?” “No,” Natalia said. At last, they pulled up to Sunrise Hospital. McAuley found a wheelchair and eased her into it, and then began pushing it up a driveway toward the trauma bay. They could already hear the moans. “Close your eyes,” he told her. “Don’t look around.” Natalia stared down, and on the ground she saw an American flag bandanna, spotted with blood. Nearing the brightly lit entrance, Natalia raised her head. She saw doctors and nurses desperately trying to triage maimed, wailing arrivals being unloaded along the curb. She saw bodies in the beds of pickup trucks. “Please help,” came the cries. “Please help.” McAuley wheeled her past the sliding doors and through a wide corridor that staff members later called “the sea of blood.” She’d been shot in the back, McAuley explained to a nurse. She had no exit wound, he said, but appeared to be stable, at least for now. He looked at Natalia. “You’ll be fine,” McAuley said. “I’ll see you later.” She forced a smile. “Thank you,” she told him, before the firefighter ran back outside to help others. A nurse changed her IV and wrote something in marker – vital signs, she thought – on her forehead. “It’s really hard to breathe,” she said, but in a hospital that would treat 199 patients from the festival that night, nobody had time to care for her yet. One victim after another sped by atop gurneys, their wheels streaking a tile floor that had transformed from beige to red. The air smelled of iron. “Watch out. Watch out,” she heard. “Cardiac arrest,” she heard. Natalia thought about her sister. It was in this hospital where their lives had begun. Where Gianna had been born first, crying, and Natalia had come out a minute later, making no noise at all. Where the doctors had been forced to resuscitate her because she wasn’t breathing. Where the girls had gone home, together, after just four days in recovery, stronger than anyone expected. Natalia closed her eyes. “Talia!” she heard a voice call. She looked up, and there, atop another gurney, was her twin. “What happened?” asked Gianna, her left thigh bleeding from a bullet that had passed straight through it. Natalia motioned to her shoulder. “I love you,” Gianna said. “I love you,” her sister responded. — The Monday morning sunlight leaked through the shades and into hospital room 272, where Natalia had spent the night in intensive care. A brace was wrapped around her neck, and on her face, a clear tube fed oxygen into both nostrils. Hours earlier, another tube that drained air and blood seeping from her punctured lung had been shoved between two ribs as Natalia, screaming, clenched a nurse’s hand. The bullet, she would learn, had traveled the distance of four football fields, pierced her right shoulder blade and fragmented. Slivers of metal had scattered throughout her chest cavity, slitting the lung, but missing her arteries, her trachea, her heart. A larger chunk of shrapnel, however, had veered to the left after impact, burrowing beneath her skin and over her spine before it struck Natalia’s opposite shoulder blade, fracturing that one, too. A change in the bullet’s trajectory of just centimeters might have killed her, but here she was with her sister, who was lying on a recliner nearby, gauze wrapped around her left thigh. Now Natalia just wanted to sleep, so she closed her eyes. Then came a sound so clear in her mind that, for a moment, she swore it had to be real: gunshots. Before he killed himself in Room 32135 at Mandalay Bay, Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds, injuring at least 450 people for reasons that remain unknown. But the wounds from the worst mass shooting in modern American history weren’t only physical. Among the most traumatized was Marie. Even after she and Summer left the church parking lot and made it to the safety of their homes, Marie couldn’t shake a debilitating sense of dread. Too distraught to sleep alone, she asked her mother to lie in bed with her until morning. At 7:15, the 16-year-old’s phone buzzed with a text from Summer, who had just learned about the enormity of what they survived: “Omfg 50+ dead. I can’t believe this.” “Oh my god summer. I woke up crying so many times,” Marie texted back, unable to imagine going to school that day. But Shae, who’d gotten home at 4 a.m., had never considered not going. She knew her parents would work on the investigation all day, and she didn’t want to stay home alone. She’d be fine, Shae told herself. She put on leggings beneath a pink nightgown, because it was “Pajama Day” at Faith, and headed to school, where she walked into her first class and approached her British literature teacher. “I don’t have my homework because it’s in my car,” Shae said, explaining that it was still parked at the crime scene. “I’m really surprised that you’re even here,” her teacher replied.

Sign Up Shae joined her classmates in the high school gym for an impromptu assembly. “It’s not the ideal way to start homecoming week,” Dan Buikema, Faith’s guidance director, told the 1,100 students, who listened in silence. He updated them on Natalia and Gianna but said he knew the massacre’s impact on Faith would extend well beyond the twins. The school was still trying to determine the number of students who had attended the concert, eventually counting 10. The youngest, an eighth-grader, had tripped on a body while fleeing with her mother and was left covered in blood. There were at least 17 more Faith students who had family or nonschool friends at the festival, and several were close to someone hurt or killed. “We’ve seen this kind of stuff happen around the world,” Buikema continued. “We’ve not seen this happen in our community.” Their community was Summerlin, a 35-square-mile collection of palm-tree-lined golf courses, $600,000-plus homes and augustly named neighborhoods: Reverence and the Summit, Affinity and Chardonnay. “The Summerlin Bubble,” people sometimes called it, and at the center was Faith, one of Nevada’s most highly regarded schools. At nearly $12,000 a year, Faith Lutheran Middle School and High School offered sixth- to 12th-graders the opportunity to pursue an array of interests, from programming drones to producing films to climbing rock faces. Its campus of red-brick buildings, which included two gymnasiums and a 772-seat performing arts center, looked like a university. Every 2017 graduate, the school advertised, had gone on to attend college. Faith didn’t try to shelter its students from people who were suffering – groups traveled on mission trips every year – but they knew that theirs was a world of privilege and comfort. Now, in the gym, a teacher played guitar, leading the assembly in a hymn. “All the earth rejoice. He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,” sang students sitting on the bleachers around Shae, who wanted to join but just couldn’t get the words out. It struck Shae in her next class that, somehow, she’d never cleaned the scrapes on her knees from the night before. She went to the nurse’s office, raising her nightgown and leggings to wipe away bits of asphalt embedded in her shins. Marie pulled into Faith’s parking lot Tuesday morning and saw what she’d seen every morning for years: other kids, walking, talking, laughing. She began to sob. Marie used to be one of them, she thought, doing and saying normal things, believing everything was okay. But now nothing felt OK. Marie hurried to her first class, AP English, and immediately had to leave. “I don’t know if I can do this,” Marie texted her mother. A day earlier, the teenager had spent hours at home watching news coverage of the shooting on TV. In her next class, the teacher, who hadn’t been told that Marie was at the festival, asked whether she could stay after school to take a test she’d missed. Suddenly, Marie was stricken with the sense that everything she’d cared about most – grades, the SAT, admittance into a top-tier college with an equestrian program – didn’t matter. “No,” she said. “I can’t take it after school.” Later, in a hallway, she and Summer talked about what was happening to them. “It feels so weird walking around,” Marie said. “It feels like we’re different,” Summer said. Nothing left the girls more convinced of that than how they reacted to noises. The roar of a motorcycle sent Summer sprinting to her front door. “What’s wrong?” her mother asked. “I don’t know,” Summer responded. Marie couldn’t stand a classmate zipping an eraser stick in and out, and in her living room on Tuesday night, the sound of a slamming door terrified her. Marie’s ears rang. She shrieked. Her mother, Susan, rushed in from the kitchen. For 15 minutes, she watched her daughter weep. Later that evening, Marie noticed someone parked across the street in their cul-de-sac. She checked every lock and closed every shutter. She set the alarm. When she got up to her bedroom, though, Marie realized her phone charger was still downstairs. She woke up her mom. “I need you to come with me,” Marie said. When they walked back down, the car was gone. She didn’t understand. If it had pulled away, she would have heard it. Marie insisted she had seen someone. But now came a more unsettling possibility. Maybe, Marie thought, it had all been in her mind. Shae sat on the ground outside her class, considering the right words to say as a camera was positioned in front of her. She’d been asked to describe her experience for a video the school planned to show during that week’s chapel services. Shae wore a long-sleeve plaid shirt and her hair in braided pigtails because it was Faith’s “Wilderness Explorer Day” in honor of the Disney movie “Up,” the theme for homecoming. “I know that I got out of that situation because God was with us, and I definitely know that He’s still with me now,” she said in the interview. “I have moments in the day that I really just feel a struggle, and I just feel like I can’t – like I just want to hole up in myself and not deal with any of it, but I know that I can’t do that.” Shae had never not dealt with things. She was an honor-roll regular and editor in chief of the Crusader Chronicle, Faith’s student newspaper. In third grade, her mother recalled, Shae came home one day complaining that the other kids didn’t take their assignments seriously enough. She labored to stay composed all week and tried to help Delaney, who’d hidden with her in the Luxor restroom, do the same. When she was asked to write a first-person account for the Chronicle about their escape, Shae gave it this headline: “I’m not a victim, I’m a survivor.” She couldn’t bear to watch, though, when a teacher played a TV interview with Natalia and Gianna in class that included clips of the bloodshed. As Shae looked down at her desk, she noticed classmates staring. “Shae, stop reliving it,” whispered a friend sitting next to her. In a chapel service, when a student yelled at the speaker, she clutched the arms on her chair and sat up, panicked. “I need to get out of here,” Shae thought, before a friend told her that it was part of the presentation. She left school early one afternoon to be with her mother, who had worked on the investigation most of the week but wanted to take Shae to get a manicure. Elena sat on their couch, and Shae laid her head on her mom’s lap for a few minutes before they headed to the nail salon. “How are you?” Elena asked in the car. “Everyone keeps telling me that I’m so strong,” she said, “but I just don’t feel strong right now.” Elena told her there was nothing wrong with that, and then they went inside the salon and Shae got her fingernails painted periwinkle blue to match a homecoming dress she no longer wanted to wear. It was Friday morning, the beginning of Natalia’s fifth day in the hospital, and a doctor had just pulled the chest tube out from between her ribs. All week, she and Gianna had been the focus of unrelenting attention. The twins had done interviews on “Good Morning America” and “Inside Edition.” They’d heard from producers for “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Dr. Phil.” ABC’s “20/20” had even flown Dean McAuley, the firefighter who had helped Natalia get to the hospital, back from Seattle to orchestrate an emotional on-camera reunion between the two. Amid all of it — the hundreds of messages on Facebook, the stream of well-wishers, the repeated questions about what it felt like to witness and face death — the twins remained unflinchingly positive. The online conspiracy theorists fixated on their smiles, insisting it was evidence that their stories weren’t true. But Natalia had been that way — “#keepsmiling,” she’d written next to a photo of herself in the hospital — since she was little. Her outlook was born of a compassion so deep that when she returned from a ninth-grade mission trip to Mexico, she announced to her parents that she wanted to become a traveling nurse, move to Africa and treat victims of Ebola. Twenty-two hours after being shot, still in the intensive care unit, Natalia wrote on Instagram: “I am so blessed to be alive at this moment of time.” Now, though, on Friday, the last of the TV cameras had left, and with them went the distractions. Natalia finally had time to consider what she might miss during her last homecoming weekend before graduation. With the chest tube out, she had only one question for her doctor: “Can I go to the football game tonight?” Two hours later, her sister rolled on an electric scooter through a tunnel of pompom-shaking cheerleaders and into the gymnasium, where hundreds of students gathered for a pep rally stood to applaud. “We would like to dedicate this assembly and the rest of our cheer season to Gianna and Natalia Baca,” a girl announced on a microphone. Then the cheer team performed, and the lip sync competition began. The freshmen went first, followed by the sophomores and juniors and, at last, the seniors. Between songs, the narrators recounted highlights of “our Faith Lutheran adventure”: the first dances and dates, cars and crushes. Natalia knew the entire lip-sync routine and had so looked forward to performing with her classmates one more time, to hitting her mark as the seniors romped to the final song, “We’re All in This Together.” Instead, she watched on FaceTime from her hospital room, blowing into a deep-breathing device, hoping that her lung wouldn’t collapse so that, maybe, she could make the football game. — The prayer had been said and the moment of silence had been held, and now, between the stadium’s bleachers, teenagers lining a pathway held up their phones, ready to record. Faith’s high school principal, Scott Fogo, waved up at the public-address booth and then pointed at who was behind him: Gianna, driving her scooter, and Natalia, less than five hours removed from the hospital, in a wheelchair being pushed by their dad. “Ladies and gentlemen, will you direct your attention to the 35-yard line,” the announcer said over the loudspeaker, his voice rising. “Welcome back Natalia and Gianna Baca.” The crowd stood and clapped as Faith’s cheerleaders surrounded the girls. “We love you, Bacas!” they chanted in unison. The principal, eyes watery, watched from a few feet away. He wore a maroon T-shirt that on the front showed an image of the girls above the hashtag #BacaStrong and on the back included a verse from 2 Corinthians about God’s comfort in times of trouble. Fogo, bald, bespectacled and known among students for his reassuring hugs, had given out more of them that week than any other in his career. He and his staff had done all they could think of – bringing in comfort dogs, calling traumatized students at home when they missed classes, prepping teachers for the inevitable questions and breakdowns, arranging for three counselors to attend the dance, just in case. “I don’t know what I say to my kid,” parents had told Fogo, so he helped set up a meeting for them with a Harvard-trained psychiatrist. He had even researched the aftermath of the Columbine High School rampage and discovered that a student who’d witnessed the violence hanged himself a year later. By Friday, he and Faith’s counselors had already begun to work on a plan for the months ahead, when they knew things would return to normal for many in the community but might not — then, or ever — for at least 10 of their kids. Fogo waited as Natalia’s dad parked her wheelchair next to Gianna. The twins faced the cheer team they co-captained, and in front of Natalia were the personalized black boxes that the girls stood on during games. Neatly stacked on top of hers was a megaphone and two gold pompoms. “Natalia,” it read. “Varsity Cheer 2018.” A tear tumbled down her cheek, and when the local TV journalists noticed it, they crept closer and pointed their lenses. Then out came the microphones, and back came her smile. “I haven’t seen a big crowd in, like, a week, so it was very overwhelming,” she told the reporters. “This school is family to me, so I didn’t want to miss it.” They backed away, and she eased out of the wheelchair. “Go, Crusaders! Go!” her teammates shouted. She leaned against the fence behind her, lightly bouncing one foot to the rhythm and tapping her hands together. Natalia knew she would never cheer at another football game. “Go, Crusaders. Go,” she mouthed in silence as her smile disappeared. Beyond the end zone, Shae and Delaney had just come into the stadium, both wearing #BacaStrong shirts. They walked toward the far side of the field to watch friends on the dance team, the two of them holding hands, just as the girls had done five nights earlier when they fled the concert. “I just don’t want to lose her in the crowd,” Delaney said. A dark-haired classmate in a polo shirt stopped to give Shae a hug. He’d heard she was at the festival. “That’s crazy. You’re okay, though, right?” the teen asked Shae, who, to him, looked no different. “Yeah,” she said and nodded, because the real answer was too hard to explain. Shae and Delaney spotted Summer. She’d come without Marie, who had finally made it through a day of classes but decided not to attend the game or any of the homecoming weekend activities. The girls compared how they were feeling. “I’m actually good today because I didn’t go to school,” Summer said. Delaney thought she’d made progress, too. “I only cried once,” she said. “Guys, I took off my bracelet,” Summer told them, referring to the purple Route 91 Harvest band. “I need to take mine off,” Shae responded. “I’m leaving it on,” Delaney said. “Even for tomorrow?” Summer asked, referring to the dance. “It’s kind of a constant reminder.” “It’s just like a — I’m lucky. I was lucky,” Delaney said. “It doesn’t make me sad anymore.” Shae, glancing down at her left wrist, said nothing. Natalia limped over the curb onto the sidewalk, and as the fading sunlight cut through the palm trees on Saturday evening, her iridescent white dress flashed shades of pink and blue, just as she’d imagined. But Natalia, one hand holding Gianna’s and the other squeezing her phone, didn’t seem to notice. It was just past 5 p.m., and they were waiting on the sprawling lawn outside the JW Marriott to get their homecoming photos taken, along with dozens of other Faith teens. Two local stylists had done their hair free at home, and a friend had bought them flats, because neither twin could stand in heels. The sisters had already decided to skip the dance. “There’s loud music. I don’t want to go,” Natalia had told her mom, and Gianna agreed. Still, both girls wanted pictures. Now Natalia checked her phone for the third time. Parker, the teen who’d asked her to homecoming, was running late. “Where’s your date?” asked Gianna’s boyfriend. “He’s coming at 5:30,” she said, but at 5:30, he still hadn’t arrived. Another parent walked over to say hello. “Both of you are here?” she said to the girls, surprised. “Where are your dates?” “Parker’s coming,” Natalia said. She checked her phone again. “He’s got 2 minutes,” someone announced at 5:43. One minute later, he made it. She grinned, and they shared a gentle embrace. He slipped a white rose corsage on her left wrist, and she held the matching boutonniere up to his navy blue lapel. “I’m just going to act like I’m doing it,” she said, laughing. Now they needed to get a portrait, so she motioned for him to shiftto her left. “I can move this arm,” Natalia said. From the camera’s view, she looked like any other girl, hair curled, eyelashes long, makeup pristine. The dress’s open back, though, revealed a patch of ivory bandages, the only evidence that the bones in her shoulders were fractured, that her chest was littered with bullet fragments. Parker put his arm around her, smiling as he searched for a spot to rest his hand. They posed with Gianna and her boyfriend and, later, a few other classmates. Then Natalia hugged her date goodbye and shuffled toward an awaiting truck. “Six o’clock. Take your pill,” a family friend said, because it was time for her painkiller. The woman helped her into the back seat, and 51 minutes after it began, Natalia’s homecoming ended. Across town, Shae was at Delaney’s house, struggling to find the right expression for their pictures. None of them felt quite right. “What’s wrong with us?” Shae asked, especially frustrated because 2016’s homecoming had cemented their friendship. Both had just come out of serious relationships and bonded over silly, finger-on-their-chin poses and a long night on the dance floor. When Brevin, the boy taking Shae, arrived, the girls got into the back of his family’s Ford Mustang. With their dates up front, Shae and Delaney took selfies together, and the night finally started to feel the way it was supposed to. The four of them had gone out in the same car, with the top down, on the night Brevin asked Shae to the dance. On the way, the girls had begged him to play country music, and he’d refused, and they’d all laughed about it ever since. Now, on the way to homecoming, he asked if they wanted to hear country music. Not tonight, the girls told him. They pulled up to the school and spotted Fogo, who was welcoming students. Shae and Delaney walked straight to the principal and hugged him, together. At a table in the cafeteria, the girls ate chicken and salad with their dates and talked about the decorations inside the gym. Shae had helped set up everything until midnight Friday and then again Saturday morning. “Wait till you see it,” she told Delaney. “It’s really pretty.” Shae had worried all week that she and her classmates wouldn’t enjoy the dance, but she’d invested so much of herself to make sure they did – covering the bleachers in black tarp, assembling light towers wrapped in linen, putting together a gazebo threaded in faux ivy around the dessert table, painting a miniature house that looked just like the one that floats away in the movie “Up.” On their way out of the cafeteria, the girls ran into Summer and exchanged hugs and compliments about their dresses. “I’m just going to warn you guys, there are a lot of balloons in there,” said Shae, who knew that, a day earlier, one had popped just as Delaney walked into the gym and she’d ducked to cover her head. But her best friend was too excited to worry about that, so Shae, Delaney and their dates headed across the courtyard. Reading this on your iPhone or iPad?

The rap song “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” thudded from the speakers as they walked through the gym’s double doors, where hundreds of students were bouncing in the dark beneath white ceiling drapes. The four of them passed white-clothed tables decorated with white rose petals and Mason jars filled with white lights that looked like fireflies. They sat on a bench along the side of the gym, and Shae took off her floral Steve Madden heels. Hand in hand, the girls approached the dance floor, maneuvering along the edge, outside the scrum. They found friends near the front, below the DJ booth, and began to dance. “Stanky Legg” came on, and the students roared. Delaney, beaming, let go of Shae’s hand. The bass boomed louder. The crowd grew larger. Shae felt her chest tighten. “I’ll be back,” she told a friend standing next to her. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yeah, I just need a minute,” she said, slipping away before Delaney could notice. Shae went to the principal. “It’s a little overwhelming,” she said, and he told her to take a break if she needed to. Shae picked up her phone and rushed toward the doors, fleeing beneath an arch of rainbow-colored balloons on her way out. On the far side of the courtyard, she stood barefoot along the edge of the sidewalk, her pink toenails buried in the grass. A string of lights between two poles hung overhead, illuminating the scrapes on her legs that still hadn’t healed. She called her dad. “I just can’t have fun,” Shae told him, her voice faltering. “I want to, but I can’t.” When he’d finished assuring her that it was going to be okay and they’d hung up, she stepped away from the light. Then Shae sat down and wept. Natalia finished her strawberry ice cream with gummy bears and watched an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” before she headed to her bedroom. Crumpled in the corner was the poster Parker had brought to the school parking lot when he asked her to the dance, just before she and Gianna left for Route 91. “HOMECOMING,” it read. He’d gone that evening without her. She lay down and closed her eyes. Natalia normally slept in complete darkness but couldn’t do that anymore, so she left the door open and the lights above her mirror on. As she began to fall asleep, Natalia knew what was coming. A sound so clear that, each night, she had to tell herself it wasn’t real: gunshots.

Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams announced Monday that police arrested 69-year-old Bernardino Gawala Bolatete after he tried to buy a gun silencer from an undercover officer. Police began investigating Bolatete after receiving a tip from a confidential source that Bolatete was planning a mass shooting at the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida. An undercover officer contacted him and arranged the sale of the silencer. During taped conversations, Bolatete repeated his plans for the shooting. He was arrested Friday after the silencer was delivered. Williams said Bolatete already had the weaponry necessary to carry out the attack. Bolatete is being held by the FBI and more charges could be filed. It was not known if he has an attorney.

Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is challenging Republican incumbents with a six-figure ad buy. Financed by the advocate’s gun safety group, Giffords, the ads pressure representatives to vote against the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. Slated to appear before the House this week, the bill requires states allowing concealed weapons to recognize concealed carry permits issued in other states.
“In the wake of our country’s worst mass shooting, Congress came up with its most dangerous idea yet: nearly anyone with a hidden loaded gun would be allowed into your community. No background check? No training? No questions asked,” says a female narrator over images of police officers and firearms. “Will Jason Lewis side with law enforcement, or the gun lobby?”
Politico reports that the television ads target Congressmen Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) and Jason Lewis (R-Minn.). Additional online ads focus on Representatives Steve Knight (R-Calif.), Ed Royce (R-Calif.), Miami Waters (R-Calif.), Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), and Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.)
“The ads call on voters to speak up about this dangerous bill and call on their leaders put the safety of communities before the interests of the gun industry,” Giffords’ executive director Peter Ambler told Politico.
After surviving an assassination attempt while meeting with constituents in Tucson in 2011, Giffords became a leading advocate against gun violence. The former congresswoman consolidated her activism and gun reform movements into Giffords in 2016. “In the wake of our country’s worst mass shooting, Congress came up with its most dangerous idea yet: nearly anyone with a hidden loaded gun would be allowed into your community.

12,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/05/youtube-offensive-videos-journalists-moderators,"As harmful material continues to appear on sites like YouTube and Facebook, companies rely on journalists and citizens to flag it – and the system is failing Last modified on Tue 5 Dec 2017 14.31 GMT The viral YouTube videos featured screaming children being tortured, conspiracy theorists taunting mass shooting victims and webcam footage of young girls in revealing clothing. The disturbing clips drew millions of views and, up until recently, were continuing to spread on the site. Then, hours after reporters highlighted them to YouTube, asking for comment, the videos disappeared.  The removal of the harmful footage illustrated a dark pattern in Silicon Valley and a common feature of some of the biggest tech scandals of 2017: journalists have become the de facto moderators for the most powerful social media corporations, exposing offensive content that the companies themselves have failed to detect. In the face of increasing recognition that Facebook, Google, Twitter and others have had detrimental impacts on society – whether enabling harassment and violence, spreading misinformation or threatening core functions of democracy – the companies have largely resisted fundamental changes that would reduce the damage. On the contrary, Silicon Valley has stuck to its foundational belief that tech firms are ultimately not accountable for the content on their platforms. They have outsourced social responsibility to journalists, watchdogs and other citizens, who have increasingly taken on the role of unpaid moderators – flagging abusive, dangerous and illegal material, which the sites then remove in the face of bad publicity. By many measures, it’s a system that is failing. “They’ve been quite content to let the general public or conventional news media do their work for them,” said Jane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota, who has criticized Facebook’s impact on journalism. The philosophy, she said, was: “‘Maximize our presence and our money, and if something goes wrong, we will ask for forgiveness.’” On a weekly basis, reporters discover glaring flaws and alarming content, launching a predictable cycle of takedowns, apologies and vague promises to re-evaluate. Often, the companies’ arbitrary enforcement efforts and inadequate algorithms have failed to reject the abusive material, even though it violated official policies and standards. YouTube, for example, had allowed a wide range of videos and “verified” channels featuring child exploitation to flourish, in some cases enabling violent content to slip past the site’s YouTube Kids safety filter. Dozens of channels and thousands of videos were recently removed from the Google-owned site only because of revelations reported in BuzzFeed, the New York Times and a viral essay on Medium. Some families of mass shooting victims have also spent countless hours trying to get YouTube to remove harassing videos from conspiracy theorists. They’ve described an emotionally taxing and often unsuccessful process of flagging the footage. But when the Guardian recently sent YouTube 10 such videos, the site removed half of them for violating “policy on harassment and bullying” within hours of an email inquiry. YouTube also changed its search algorithm to promote more reputable news sources after a day of negative news coverage surrounding offensive video content attacking victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting. On Monday, YouTube said that it would hire thousands of new moderators next year in an effort to fight child abuse content in the same way the site has tackled violent extremist videos. With more than 10,000 moderators total across Google, the company said it would still continue to rely heavily on machine learning to identify problematic content. Facebook, too, has repeatedly been forced to reverse course and publicly apologize after embarrassing or unethical decisions by algorithms or internal moderators (who have said they are overburdened and underpaid). ProPublica reported this month that Facebook was allowing housing advertisements to illegally exclude users by race. That’s despite the fact that Facebook previously said it had instituted a “machine learning” system to spot and block discriminatory ads. The tech company said in a statement that this was a “failure in our enforcement” and that it was, once again, adopting new safeguards and undergoing a policy review. Facebook, Google and Twitter were all also forced to change policies this year after reporters revealed that users could buy ads targeted to offensive categories, such as people who consider themselves “Jew haters”. “They are concerned about getting as many eyeballs on to as many advertisements as is humanly possible,” said Don Heider, founder of the Center for Digital Ethics and Policy. “That doesn’t always bode well for what the results are going to be.” Facebook and Twitter have both faced intense backlash for allowing abuse and false news to flourish while simultaneously shutting down accounts and posts featuring legitimate news and exposing wrongdoing. For affected users, sometimes the best way to get action is to tell a journalist. Facebook reinstated a Chechen independence activist group this year after the Guardian inquired about its decision to shut down the page for “terrorist activity”. Reporters’ inquiries also forced the site to admit that it had erred when it censored posts from a Rohingya group opposing Myanmar’s military, which has been accused of ethnic cleansing. There are no easy solutions to moderation given the scale and complexity of the content, but experts said the companies should invest significantly more resources into staff with journalism and ethics backgrounds. Facebook’s fact-checking efforts – which have been unsuccessful, according to some insiders – should involve a large team of full-time journalists structured like a newsroom, said Kirtley: “They have to start acting like a news operation.” Reem Suleiman, campaigner with SumOfUs, a not-for-profit organization that has criticized Facebook for having a “racially biased” moderation system, argued that the companies should be more transparent, release internal data and explain how their algorithms work: “Without the work of journalists chasing down some of this information, we’re just completely left in the dark.” Claire Wardle, research fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, said the platforms were starting to develop more robust specialist teams doing moderation work. Still, she said, it was “shocking” that Twitter would not have detected propaganda accounts that a group of BuzzFeed reporters without access to internal data was able to uncover. “The cynical side of me thinks they are not looking, because they don’t want to find it,” she said. A Twitter representative touted its machine learning technology and said it detected and blocks 450,000 suspicious logins each day. The statement also praised the work of the media, saying: “We welcome reporting that identifies Twitter accounts that may violate our terms of service, and appreciate that many journalists themselves use Twitter to identify and expose such disinformation in real time.” A Facebook representative noted that the company was hiring thousands of people to review content and will have 7,500 total by the end of the year. That team works to evaluate whether content violates “community standards”, the representative noted, adding, “We aren’t the arbiters of truth.”",2017-12-05 03:01:10,Tech firms fail to stop abusive content – leaving the public to do the dirty work,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
13,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-glanton-concealed-carry-illinois-20171204-story.html,"We are accustomed to the crocodile tears shed in Washington every time there is a mass shooting. Politicians who actually have the power to bring about change like to talk about healing, the power of prayer and the need for Americans to come together after a violent rampage. But their solemn faces are merely masks. When memories of the tragedy begin to fade, too many politicians return to their perches in the palms of the National Rifle Association and wait for their next assignment. Then, like hired assassins, they set out on a mission to pass new laws that can only result in more bloodshed. This time, the NRA orders came barely two months after Stephen Paddock slaughtered 58 people and injured more than 500 on the Las Vegas Strip in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Paddock owned more than 40 guns of varying sizes and calibers when he went on his deadly rampage in October. In Nevada, gun owners can carry their weapons openly. Paddock would have needed a permit to carry a concealed handgun in the state, but in Nevada it would have been easy for him to get one. It would, however, have been illegal for him to bring even a single handgun into Illinois. Now, the lawmakers’ mission, as directed by the NRA, is to make it easier for gunmen to carry their weapons all over the country. Lawmakers are expected to vote this week on federal legislation that would allow anyone who has a concealed carry permit from another state to walk into a restaurant on Michigan Avenue with a handgun tucked in his or her belt. Sounds pretty scary, doesn’t it? But that’s what could happen if the NRA gets its way — and there is no reason to think House Republicans won’t fall into line. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 would take precedence over laws in states such as Illinois, California and New York that allow only those who have obtained a concealed carry permit in that state to legally carry firearms within state lines. One thing we learned from the Las Vegas shooting is that state concealed carry laws are not equal. Nevada, for example, has some of the most lax concealed carry laws in the nation. In that state, almost anyone who is at least 21 and who does not have a felony record is eligible to obtain a concealed carry permit. While gun buyers nationwide must undergo a federal background check, it is much easier in some states for bad people to slip through the cracks. Illinois has gone to great lengths to make sure that only law-abiding citizens with no history of mental illness or substance abuse can legally carry a weapon. And anyone who wants to legally carry a concealed handgun must undergo 16 hours of training in how to use it. Gun carriers also must submit to fingerprinting and possess a firearm owner’s identification card, which offers a second level of background checks through the Illinois State Police. Illinois also bars anyone who has been convicted of misdemeanor domestic battery or is under an order of protection from obtaining a firearm. These are commonsense laws that every state should have in place. But the NRA has waged a yearslong campaign to get rid of as many regulations as possible. Most states have cowered to the pressure. Now Congress is stepping in to force the stragglers into line. Following the Las Vegas shooting, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the carnage “an evil tragedy that horrifies us all.” He ordered flags over the U.S. Capitol to half-staff and issued a statement to the people of Las Vegas and families of the victims. He said, “ The whole country stands united in our shock, in our condolences, and in our prayers.” That sentiment was short-lived. At the end of the statement, he should have added, “Unless it interferes with the NRA’s agenda.” dglanton@chicagotribune.com Twitter @dahleeng RELATED CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2017-12-05 06:00:00,Federal legislation on concealed carry likely to show shock of Las Vegas shooting is short-lived,,104826,http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/

17,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-john-conyers-son-20171205-story.html,"WASHINGTON — The son of Rep. John Conyers Jr. - the embattled congressman who announced his sudden retirement Tuesday - may be headed for his father's seat, carrying on a decades-long political dynasty in Michigan. Conyers, D-Mich., resigned Tuesday amid allegations of sexual harassment; in doing so, the erstwhile dean of the House endorsed his eldest son, John Conyers III, to take his place representing Michigan's 13th Congressional District, which includes Detroit. The younger Conyers has been one of his father's fiercest defenders as the 88-year-old faced increasing pressure from Democratic leaders to step aside when a growing number of female former aides accused him of mistreatment and unwanted advances. ""It's very unfortunate to see him fight so long for so many people and to automatically have the allegations assumed to be true,"" John Conyers III told reporters last week, according to NBC affiliate WDIV. ""And of course, with sexual assault, women are to be believed. But in this instance, he has no history of this. ""And I think that if we're not going to make [Sen.] Al Franken resign when we have evidence of him groping a woman while she was asleep . . . it's disconcerting to me to see the way my father is being treated after he's given so much to this country, not just for black people but for people alike."" Of his father, he added: ""He fights for everyone."" Here's what we know about John Conyers III. He lacks political experience. Conyers is 27 and from Detroit. He attended Morehouse College as well as New York University, according to his contributor bio on HuffPost. That bio, whose details The Washington Post has not yet confirmed, identifies Conyers as ""a partner at Detroit's first minority run hedge fund"" and ""a seasoned multi-discipline consultant who has provided fundraising and social media services to both political and business clients."" It also says he served as an intern in the Department of Community Outreach in the Israeli Embassy in Washington. ""John is committed to melding community engagement, entertainment and politics,"" the bio states. He caused public headaches for his father in 2010. In 2010, MLive.com reported that John Conyers III was cited for speeding in his father's Cadillac Escalade - or rather, the government-leased vehicle his father used as a member of Congress. There were also reports that year that the younger Conyers had driven the vehicle to a rap concert and that it was broken into, according to MLive.com. The then-20-year-old reported to police that two laptops had been stolen from the Cadillac, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of concert tickets. After the incident, the elder Conyers apologized. Conyers resigns from Congress amid harassment allegations, endorses son to succeed him ""I have just learned about the inappropriate use of a congressional vehicle by my son over the Thanksgiving holiday,"" he said in a statement at the time, according MLive.com. ""I am sorry it happened and will make sure that it does not happen again."" The Detroit Free Press reported that the congressman said he reimbursed the Treasury Department more than $5,600 for his son's unofficial use of taxpayer money. A photo on social media at the time showed his son in a Cadillac with a bottle of French champagne, according to an MLive.com article. The story's headline: ""The fabulous online life of John Conyers III, or why his family needs to do damage control immediately."" He's an opinionated writer. In a HuffPost op-ed, under the headline ""Orange Watergate: The Inevitable Impeachment of the 45th President,"" Conyers wrote that the ""reactionary and cavalier nature of the president will ultimately be his down fall. ""As his approval ratings tumble and confidence wanes, expect the weight of possible impeachment to make his already poor decision making worse. Self-preservation is ultimately the downfall of the narcissist."" In the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Conyers wrote that the national debate should be about gun control, not mental illness, explaining: ""I have dealt with Major Depressive Disorder since I was 15 years-old. I've not once thought about murder. I know right from wrong. ""My friends with bi-polar and depression and multiple personality disorder don't think about hurting others, if anything we think about hurting ourselves."" ""So if you grapple with mental illness do not let the medias stigmatization of our ailments make you self-conscious,"" he wrote in his October op-ed. ""As much as they love to make us their scapegoats, It's not our fault. You, as well as I, know we know right from wrong. When they need someone to blame they look to us first, when it's time to lend their hand to help us they're nowhere to be found."" He's a rapper. In a 2013 song, ""Rich Glorious,"" Conyers talked about his battles with the media amid his mother's 2012 bribery conviction, as well as the Cadillac mishap, according to Roll Call. ""Hey f - making a living, boy, I'm trying to make history. So picture me letting the news nitpick at me,"" Conyers said in the rap video, which showed an image from a news story about the incident. He's up against his cousin for the congressional seat State Sen. Ian Conyers, John Conyers Jr.'s great-nephew, told the New York Times that he intends to run as well in the special election.

ABC proved its network has a ""fake news"" problem, after false reports about a former Trump advisor led to a correspondent's suspension. The incident reflected on ABC as a whole because it took the network so long to acknowledge and correct the error, according to MRC Vice President of Business and Culture Dan Gainor. He said it should also leave people wondering “how can you trust anything” from ABC. ABC Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross incorrectly reported on Dec. 1, that former national security advisor Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that Donald Trump asked him to contact Russians. If that were true, it would have been a bombshell revelation. But ABC got it wrong. So wrong, it suspended Ross for four weeks without pay beginning Dec. 2. In reality, Trump made that request after he had already won the election. It took ABC a full day to admit the claim needed “correction,” not just “clarification.” “It’s not just what he did that was wrong, it’s ABC’s editorial process that let it get through, it’s ABC’s reluctance to call it an error that needed correction,” Gainor said on the Dec. 4, Fox Business’ After the Bell, “At that point if you’re an investor, you’re wondering, ‘how can you can trust anything that ABC’s putting out?’”    Ross’ report was especially egregious given his personal history of false reporting, After the Bell co-host Melissa Francis suggested. She cited Ross’ 2012 report that falsely accused a Tea Party member of being the responsible for the movie theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado. Gainor had another example, citing ABC’s “pink slime” controversy which began in 2012. ABC’s reporting about Beef Products Inc resulted in a lawsuit and a huge settlement in the company’s favor. The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC, reportedly paid out at least $177 million in settlement fees to the beef company in August 2017. A lawyer representing the beef company told The New York Times the settlement was much larger, and that Disney’s insurers “are paying the rest.” The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

Michael Flynn's plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller by claiming that Flynn is ""prepared to testify that President Trump, as a candidate, Donald Trump, ordered him, directed him to make contact with the Russians which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said to this point.""It was a nuclear explosion. Within minutes, the stock market plunged 350 points.It quickly became clear that was flat-out wrong. Later, ABC News added on the evening news what it disingenuously called a ""clarification"" — actually, it said, Trump directed Flynn to contact the Russians after the election. Not only is that not scandalous but it is also completely expected for a new president. After more uproar, ABC finally found the reporting to be a ""serious error"" and suspended Ross for four weeks without pay.It's a classic journalistic mistake to try and be first to report something before it's verified. But in the Trump era, when liberals believe the president is a uniquely dangerous threat to America — and even the world — any news that could lead to speculation about Trump's impeachment or resignation is like catnip. Journalists are prone to overhype anything that could spell ""The End.""This suspension might have been an adequate punishment ... if Ross hadn't already made a long line of whoppers. Conservatives remember the 2012 movie theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, by James Holmes and how Ross came on in breaking-news mode to announce that there was a ""Jim Holmes"" on a Colorado Tea Party Patriots website ... as if that were a perfect starting point to identifying a mass shooter. It wasn't.But there are more.  In 2001, Ross claimed that the anthrax used in deadly attacks after 9/11 in Washington, D.C., and New York was coated with bentonite, a chemical compound found only in biological weapons made by then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's henchmen. Former President George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer remembers the event. He tweeted: ""I explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong. Brian Ross went with it anyway — and one week later issued a murky, hard to understand correction.""In the first month of the Iraq War in 2003, Ross reported that Hussein's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid (or ""Chemical Ali""), an Iraqi general, had been killed. Several media outlets forwarded that report. Six months later, U.S. officials announced that they had him in custody.In 2006, Ross claimed that Pakistani officials had arrested al-Qaida explosives expert Matiur Rehman, who had an ""official"" list of terrorist recruits and could lead to then-al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. A Pakistani official denounced the report as ""fictitious."" Then-ABC consultant Alexis Debat warned ABC that the report was not true a day after it was initially broadcast.In that same year, Ross breathlessly relayed that the FBI was investigating then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert for bribery in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. ""Justice Department officials describe the 64-year-old Illinois Republican as very much in the mix of the corruption investigation,"" he said. This prompted the Justice Department to deny that there was any federal probe of Hastert, and Hastert demanded a retraction of the statement and threatened to sue ABC.None of these whoppers ever led to any suspension of Ross, who's been at ABC since 1994. His liberal colleagues have given him six Peabody awards and six George Polk awards, so his reputation inside the network was apparently unscathed by his large errors.It's a little bizarre that these days, alleged sexual harassers like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer are dumped abruptly, while Brian Williams has an hourlong nightly show on MSNBC, and Brian Ross gets a slap on the wrist. These supposed guardians against ""fake news"" make it look like fact mangling isn't really a serious offense. Brian Ross should be fired. L.

21,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/06/this-show-traffics-in-culture-wars-jordan-klepper-on-his-alex-jones-inspired-satire,"The former Daily Show correspondent, who now has his own show, The Opposition, talks about what he learned attending Trump rallies Last modified on Tue 24 Apr 2018 09.59 BST On a Thursday afternoon in late November, Jordan Klepper sits at his desk in midtown Manhattan sifting through the day’s news. Less than two months into his tenure as the host of Comedy Central’s The Opposition with Jordan Klepper, the comic, formerly a correspondent on Jon Stewart and then Trevor Noah’s The Daily Show, is still getting used to anchoring a show of his own. On The Opposition, with a perpetually cocked brow and a hairstyle that adds at least several inches to his 6ft4in frame, Klepper plays a creature very much of the moment: a logic-defying, conspiratorial dingbat ripped from the Breitbart comments section who goes by the name of “Jordan Klepper”.  To prepare for his almost-nightly hosting duties (the show airs Monday through Thursday), Klepper wakes up, checks the mainstream media, like CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, and then alternative news sources such as Breitbart, the Daily Caller, and InfoWars, whose host, Alex Jones, the irascible poster-child for rightwing paranoia, is the most obvious inspiration for Klepper’s apoplectic schtick. On this day, like most days under the governance of Donald Trump, there are at least a dozen political stories circulating, each of which make for great, satirical fodder: Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of sexual misconduct against teenage girls, has blamed the scandal on a conspiracy engineered by liberals, gay people and lesbians; rumors are swirling that the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is about to be fired; the president has retweeted anti-Muslim videos from a far-right nationalist group called Britain First and, moments later, insinuated that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough may have been involved in the death of an aide. But since it’s only 1pm, some of these stories might be old news by the time Klepper steps into the studio in the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania to begin filming. “Boy, every day right now is somewhat atypical, partially because of the news cycle and partially because we’re figuring how we want to best run this show,” he says, readying for the 20th episode. “I’m different than Alex Jones or Sean Hannity, so I take some of the attitudes that they attack stories with and then try to bring my body to that character.” The character Klepper plays is a raging mural of rightwing personalities: there’s the smugness of Tucker Carlson, the strained sub-logic of Hannity, the bombast of Jones, and the waspy arrogance of Fox News’ Jesse Watters, all topped off with the host’s charismatic, newsman cadence, which almost never breaks. While it will inevitably remind viewers of Stephen Colbert’s own rightwing parody, which he mastered on The Colbert Report before moving to tamer pastures at CBS, Klepper’s character is more patently derivative of the anti-establishment anger Trump so deftly weaponized on the campaign trail. Being a correspondent on The Daily Show, where Klepper was often sent to Trump rallies to survey the fans decked out in “Lock Her Up” memorabilia, taught him something about the tribalism of American politics and how it engenders a readiness to believe pretty much anything. In one field piece for The Opposition, Klepper goes to a post-election rally in Phoenix and asks attendees to sign a petition to “Impeach Hillary”, which many of them enthusiastically do. “Talking to people legitimized these sources and points of view. We call these ideas fringe, but I don’t think they are fringe,” Klepper says. “They are being validated by Donald Trump. They hear it on the radio, they see it in their news feeds, and then they go to a stadium with 10,000 people and the guy who’s leading in the polls says Hillary Clinton is having seizures. “This is how a new reality gets created,” he says. “So we can start playing with this paranoia, this weird, new Donald Trump post-party ideology.” Asked how he’d describe the ideology, Klepper believes it’s simply about accruing symbolic victories: “It’s not about Republicans and Democrats. Seeing religious right people not giving a shit about morality, and just wanting to win on abortion – it’s: ‘I want to win, but I want you to lose.’” At The Opposition headquarters, which might be how an Alex Jones type would describe the backrooms where George Soros supposedly funds anti-Trump protests, Klepper’s dedication to character and mockery is reflected everywhere, from a pillow with the words “It’s only news if you believe it” superimposed on his visage to a paper wristband that reads “DO NOT EAT: microchip embedded”. Lest the earnestness of his parody fall on deaf ears, he makes sure his true feelings can be discerned behind the character’s veneer of Deep State anxiety. Just six episodes into his new show, the mass shooting in Las Vegas took place. Klepper rose to the occasion, delivering an incisive yet funny segment about how fellow rightwingers could avoid talking about guns. “Not even 24 hours later, these heartless liberals deployed their most sinister, nefarious, despicable weapon: talking,” he says, peering into the camera as if delivering a prophecy. “There’s only one thing for us brave, patriotic Americans to do: stand our ground, turn, and run away from this debate.” Klepper, who is 38 and was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, has been bred for his Comedy Central gig since he first joined improv troupes, such as Chicago’s Second City and iO theater in 2003, where he did a show called Whirled News Tonight. The audience would cut out news stories of the day, tack them to a wall, and comics would pick one to read aloud and improvise a scene about it. Besides honing his John Kerry impression, iO made Klepper more curious about current affairs and illustrated, as Oscar Wilde would say, the importance of being earnest, especially when it comes to political satire. “I am this character, and this character is an asshole,” he says. “I want to show some of the fears and blind spots that people have, so you can see why they’re so frustrated. Like: ‘He’s being bigoted right now, but maybe he’s not a terrible person, he’s just missing something.’” “Earnestness has always been a virtue,” he adds. “In comedy, it’s something there’s a craven need for right now because we feel so lost.” Klepper doesn’t just draw inspiration for his character from newscasters, but also from the members of the administration whose job it is to present Trumpism as a coherent doctrine. “I find Kellyanne Conway fascinating,” he says. “She is totally adept at her job and they let her do it. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is also somebody we’re watching, through gritted teeth. Those folks are doing elements of what we do. Trump will tweet this hateful, Islamophobic video with no context. Why did he do that? We don’t know. But someone has to answer for it.” Mining the discord of those defenses – “how you have to bend over backwards” to support them – informs Klepper’s own show, where he tries to untie the twisted knot at the center of far-right disaffection and, in some dark corners of the web, lunacy. But Klepper, and the cadre of satirists who have flourished in the strange, new political climate – among them Colbert, John Oliver, Klepper’s former boss Noah and his friend Samantha Bee – know that comedy’s Trump-induced bull market won’t last forever. Exhaustion, or maybe even impeachment, could be imminent. But it won’t matter much, since Klepper’s show is less about Trump than it is the henchmen who must find a tiny kernel of reason in his behavior. “If that could end tomorrow, I’d be the happiest guy in the world,” he says of Trump’s omnipresence in late-night comedy. “This show traffics in culture wars. It might literally be the NFL, because that’s the fight the commander-in-chief’s decided we ought to have. So if we can take that fight, and make a mountain out of a molehill, it’s a way for us to show the tactics, as opposed to the story.”",2017-12-06 07:00:16,'This show traffics in culture wars': Jordan Klepper on his Alex Jones-inspired satire,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
22,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/congress-to-vote-on-trump--and-nra-backed-bill-to-remove-local-gun-restrictions,"Ex-congresswoman Gabby Giffords attacks the bill, which passed by 231 to 197 and removes states’ power to control who can carry concealed, loaded handguns First published on Wed 6 Dec 2017 14.10 GMT On the day of an annual vigil in Washington DC that honors the victims of American gun violence, congressional Republicans passed a Trump-endorsed bill that would eviscerate local gun restrictions, removing states’ power to control who is allowed to carry a concealed, loaded handgun in their streets. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a margin of 231-197. Fourteen Republicans voted against while six Democrats voted for it.  Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in a 2011 mass shooting, called the vote “unthinkable”. “The House of Representatives passed a bill that would let almost anyone carry loaded, concealed firearms almost anywhere in the United States,” Giffords said in an email to gun control supporters. Officials in New York and Los Angeles warn that the legislation would allow an unknown numbers of tourists – perhaps hundreds of thousands each year – to carry concealed handguns into America’s densest urban areas, including Times Square and the New York City subway. Big city police chiefs across the county have spoken out against the bill, calling it a law enforcement nightmare. The bill, which is the National Rifle Association’s “number one legislative priority” has prompted a renewed battle over states’ rights, with Democrats for once arguing against the power of the federal government, and Republicans hoping to use that federal power to undermine local control. “It’s so transparently hypocritical. Republicans spend all day talking about states’ rights, except when it comes to guns. When it comes to guns, they want to take away states’ ability to make decisions for themselves,” Senator Chris Murphy, a leading gun control advocate who represents Newtown, Connecticut, said on Tuesday, in advance of the vote. The NRA called the vote a “watershed moment”, one more step in what the group’s chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, described as a “30-year movement” to ensure that Americans can carry their self-defense weapons across state lines. Despite an easy victory in the House, the bill faces a much more uphill battle in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to pass. “Right now, there’s no indication that the Senate Republicans want to take this legislation up. In fact, the opposite,” Murphy said. “My suspicion is there are not 60 votes for a national concealed weapons bill [in the Senate],” he said. Americans have a constitutional right to own guns in their home for self-defense. But America's 50 states have dramatically different laws when it comes to carrying guns in public, which all states allow in some form. Twelve conservative states now generally do not require any permit or training for an adult to carry a loaded handgun in public, a policy called ""constitutional carry."" In contrast, seven more liberal states issue permits sparingly and require citizens to demonstrate a justifiable need for carrying a concealed weapon. These tougher laws mean that few residents of cities Los Angeles or New York are given permits to carry concealed guns. There is also wide variation in training requirements – from states that require applicants to demonstrate actual proficiency in firing a gun, to Virginia, which requires only an online safety training course. Under current law, states do not have to recognize carry permits issued by other states, creating a confusing patchwork of regulations on whether gun owners from one state can carry their concealed weapon in another state. For years, the NRA has been trying to pass a federal law to require every state to recognize every other state's gun-carrying permits – which would make it as easy to carry a concealed gun across the country as it is to drive a car. Donald Trump has endorsed the legislation. Law enforcement officials from the nation's largest cities say this legislation would be a public safety disaster, gutting the tough restrictions in states like New York and California to and forcing them to recognize gun carry permits from all states, no matter how weak those state's laws. The NRA-backed legislation would force all states to recognize gun-carrying permits from any other state, including the dozen states that generally do not require any training or permit to carry a gun, a policy called “constitutional carry”. West Virginia’s choice to allow “constitutional carry” of concealed handguns “might be fine for West Virginia, but it’s not fine for New York City”, said Cy Vance, Manhattan’s district attorney. “I wouldn’t presume to tell West Virginia, as a New Yorker, what West Virginia’s laws should be with regard to gun possession. Can you imagine how mad they’d be?” Donald Trump endorsed the legislation during his campaign last year. Its passage came the same day that gun violence survivors, including residents of Newtown, Connecticut, were visiting congressional offices to ask politicians, once again, to take some action on gun control. Nearly five years after the 2012 Newtown school shooting, which left 26 children and educators dead, Congress has yet to pass any gun control laws. It’s not (just) about the money. In 2017, the NRA spent at least $4.1m on lobbying – more than the $3.1m it spent in all of 2016. But for comparison, the dairy industry has spent $4.4m in the same period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). The National Association of Realtors, one of the biggest spenders, has paid out $32.2m lobbying on housing issues. The NRA has plenty of cash to spend. It bet big on the 2016 US elections, pouring $14.4m into supporting 44 candidates who won and $34.4m opposing 19 candidates who lost, according to CRP. But “the real source of its power, I believe, comes from voters,” said Adam Winkler, a UCLA professor of constitutional law. The 145-year-old organization claims 5 million active members, that number is disputed, but whatever its actual size, membership is a powerful tool, said Robert Spitzer, a professor at the State University of New York at Cortland. “They have a very powerful ability to mobilize a grassroots support and to engage in politics when most Americans can barely be bothered to vote,” he said. “And because so few Americans do those things, if you get a bunch of people in a locality who are all prepared to go out to a meeting they can have a big effect."" Read more “We have nothing but heartache and compassion for the victims of Sandy Hook, but concealed carry reciprocity has nothing to do with this tragedy,” said Tatum Gibson, a spokeswoman for Richard Hudson, the North Carolina Republican congressman who introduced the legislation, said in a statement when asked about the timing of the vote. “I don’t know that putting the NRA’s agenda on the floor of the House is the right way to mark five years since Sandy Hook,” Murphy told the Guardian. “It is heartbreaking to think as we come up to the fifth anniversary of Newtown, Republicans in the House are pushing through a bill to make our country less safe.” At the same time, Murphy argued, the political maneuvering over the bill could be seen as a sign of the growing strength of the gun control movement. Before the House vote, Republicans combined the controversial NRA-backed “Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act” with a modest measure to make sure the military and other federal agencies are reporting records to the nation’s gun background check system. The Sutherland Springs mass shooting last month revealed that the air force had failed to submit to the background checks system dozens of records that should have disqualified dangerous people from gun ownership, including the domestic violence conviction of the man who went on to murder 26 people at a small Baptist church in Texas. “It says something really interesting about the vulnerability that Republicans feel on guns today,” Murphy said. “Republicans are increasingly worried about the optics of pushing the NRA agenda, and that’s why they’re trying to add on some anti-gun violence legislation.” Republicans’ attempt to tear down local restrictions on gun carrying comes just weeks after two of America’s deadliest mass shootings, at a country music concert in Las Vegas and a tiny church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The move highlights the stark divide in Americans’ opinions on guns, with some conservatives seeing increased civilian gun carrying as a way to prevent or lessen the toll of mass shootings, even as many other Americans are trying to fight against America’s gun-carrying culture and get guns off the street. Under current law, states have dramatically different standards for who is allowed to carry a concealed, loaded weapon. A handful of more liberal states give law enforcement officials discretion when granting a carry permit and some require that applicants demonstrate a specific need for self-defense. But the majority of states make it easy for citizens to get a carry license. While some states require that permit holders demonstrate proficiency with a gun at a firing range, others only require some kind of gun safety course. In Virginia, applicants don’t even need to leave the house: it’s possible to get a concealed carry license after taking a gun safety course online. Many states currently recognize each other’s carry permits, in the same way states recognize each other’s driver’s licenses, but some states pick and choose which licenses they will honor, and a few states, including New York, recognize no outside permits at all. Gun rights advocates say the current patchwork of state laws governing gun carrying is confusing for law-abiding gun owners, and that American states and cities with the toughest gun control laws are violating Americans’ constitutional right to carry firearms for self-defense. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, hailed the bill’s passage in a statement saying “the truth is that concealed carry laws save lives”. Opponents of the legislation say the right way to fix the confusion over differing regulations is to create a uniform national standard for training and eligibility, not simply force the states with the toughest gun control regulations to allow the most untrained, unvetted gun carriers to walk their streets. Adam Winkler, a gun law expert at the University of California Los Angeles, said the legislation the House is currently considering would also allow local residents in cites with tough restrictions to do an end run around local laws, and get their permit to carry a gun from another state with weaker laws. One of the proposed Democratic amendments to the bill would close that loophole. An estimated three million Americans report carrying a loaded handgun on a daily basis, and an estimated nine million report doing so on a monthly basis, according to a recent study based on a survey conducted by Harvard and Northeastern researchers.",2017-12-06 09:10:42,Congress to vote on Trump- and NRA-backed bill to remove local gun restrictions,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

27,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsblaze/AHOs/~3/WWPB2tFtq1g/,"Victims of the Las Vegas shooting have filed lawsuits over the attack. The mass shooting, which occurred in October 2017, left 58 dead and over 500 more people wounded. Five lawsuits were filed before Thanksgiving against MGM Resorts International. MGM owns Mandalay Bay Hotel, where the shooter was found. The lawsuits also name Live National Entertainment, the promoter of the Route 91 Harvest festival. Lawsuits allege that the businesses contributed to the attacks. Victims and those suffering post-traumatic stress, are included in the lawsuits. The lawsuits have been filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. The lawsuits allege that the hotel, staff, venue and festival all engaged in negligent acts, which contributed to the suffering of victims. “Under the doctrine of premises liability, organizers and property owners are responsible for ensuring the safety and well-being of attendees. This includes events such as the tragic Route 91 Harvest Concert in Las Vegas. When negligent security, improper maintenance, inadequate staffing, etc. causes an injury or death, these individuals and entities can be held accountable for the medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, and other damages their actions create,” states LV Accident. The lawsuit claims that the hotel’s staff didn’t monitor the shooter, Mr. Paddock, properly. The lawsuit alleges that proper monitoring may have allowed for a faster response. Mr. Paddock’s room was filled with over two dozen weapons as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition. The lawsuit claims proper monitoring would have caught Mr. Paddock stocking his room with weapons. MGM Resorts claims that “these kinds of lawsuits are not unexpected and we intend to defend ourselves against them.” Live Nation has failed to comment on the matter. The lawsuit claims that Live Nation, along with MGM, hired festival workers that were not properly prepared for the shooting. The lawsuit claims that exits were not clearly marked and that there should have been more exits on the premises. Mr. Paddock’s estate has been named in the lawsuit and the business that was responsible for the event’s security. Reports from mid-November note lawyers from Las Vegas, Texas and Illinois interviewing victims in an attempt to file hundreds of lawsuits. The large spectrum of victims has led to several large law firms seeking to represent victims and benefit from the massacre. One law firm has affirmed that they interviewed 50 victims with plans to interview hundreds more. The law firm claims that they have reached out to other law firms to deal with the massive amounts of claims. Victims claim that they’ve been haunted by the tragic events. Elisha Seng, a native of Illinois, attended the concert, but was not injured in the shooting. Seng is named in the lawsuit, claiming that the images of a young woman clutching her throat and covered in blood before falling to the ground continues to haunt her. Seng claims that recently, heavy rain was mistaken for gunshots. She claims that she has nightmares and difficulty sleeping following the attacks. Lawsuits question why Paddock was a VIP guest, given access to a service elevator and why there were no security cameras on the floor he stayed in. The lawsuit also questions why the hotel lacked gunshot detection devices. Melissa Thompson writes about a wide range of topics, revealing interesting things we didn’t know before.

28,https://www.bustle.com/p/who-is-omar-delgado-the-pulse-nightclub-hero-cop-who-has-ptsd-from-the-shooting-is-losing-his-job-7428324,"News  After helping usher people to safety following the devastating shooting at Orlando's Pulse nightclub, Officer Omar Delgado is being let go from the Eatonville Police Department. Delgado, the 45-year old corporal, believes his PTSD related to the mass shooting led to his termination. Making the situation more dire, his last day falls six months before he could have received his full pension. Delgado was one of the first officers on the scene of the Pulse tragedy, when 49 people were killed and 58 more injured in June 2016. He was diagnosed with PTSD two months after the attack and wasn't able to work for six months, CNN reports. When he returned, he was only able to work desk duty. Delgado claims his PTSD played a part in his termination, and said he was told by the police department that a doctor found him ""unfit for duty"" and there was no other position he could take. Eatonville Deputy Chief Joseph Jenkins has confirmed that Delgado's last day will be Dec. 31, but the Eatonville PD has not commented on why he was let go. ""We have embraced Officer Delgado wholeheartedly from the start of this,"" Jenkins told CNN. ""We have surrounded him with love and support and continue to support him ... and have done everything within our power for him."" Bustle has reached out to the police department for comment. Angel Colon is one of the Pulse victims Delgado helped save. He was shot six times before Delgado pulled him out of the nightclub, and the two men had an emotional reunion in Colon's hospital room a few days later. When Colon heard about Delgado's termination, he said it was disrespectful to both Delgado and himself. ""He was my hero,"" Colon told the local WFTV. ""He saved my life and for them to just do what theyâre doing to him in front of my face is a slap to my face, as well. ... He did his job that night on June 12 so they should have his back 100 percent, totally, and just be there for whatever he needs."" In six months, Delgado would have been on the police force for 10 years, when he would have become vested in his pension. He currently makes $38,500 a year, and he would have began receiving 64 percent of his salary and full benefits when he turned 55 had he reached that 10-year mark. Because it was cut short, he'll receive 42 percent of his salary, according to The Orlando Sentinel. Because he's only 45, though, he'll be without a paycheck in January. ""This Christmas is going to be a really sad one,"" he told USA Today. ""Thereâs simply not enough money to make it."" Delgado said he would have happily left the police department in six months, but the decision to keep him from getting his full pension shocked him. âJust let me get vested,"" he said, ""and I will be more than happy to pack up my troubles and leave."" The Eatonville Town Council voted to pay Delgado $1,200 before taxes in accrued sick time. A GoFundMe page was also started to support him financially, and has already surpassed its $25,000 goal.

30,http://observer.com/2017/12/concealed-carry-bill-gets-support-from-3-nj-house-members/,"Guns cannot be carried in New Jersey. (Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Reps. Tom MacArthur (R-3), Frank LoBiondo (R-2) and Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-11) on Wednesday were the only members of New Jersey’s 12-member congressional delegation to vote in favor of a House bill that would make it legal for those granted concealed carry permits in their home states to carry weapons in other states, even if the laws of those states are contradictory.
New Jersey has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the state and concealed carry permits are rarely or never granted to ordinary citizens. If the bill –known as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act– becomes federal law, it will contradict existing state laws and would increase the number of legally carried guns in the state. Opponents of the bill say that concealed carry reciprocity makes states like New Jersey less safe. But advocates for changing the law say that it eliminates criminal penalties for law-abiding citizens who travel out of state and are unaware that concealed carry permits do not transfer across state lines.
MacArthur said that the legislation will prevent wrongful convictions of people like Shaneen Allen, a Pennsylvania nurse who in 2013 was arrested in New Jersey for carrying her weapon, something that she did not think violated any laws since she had a permit issued from her state. Though she initially faced a prison term, Allen was required to participate in a pretrial intervention program and was later pardoned by Gov. Chris Christie.
“This legislation will ensure that what happened to Shaneen does not happen to any other law-abiding gun owners by requiring states to recognize each other’s gun carry permits, while recognizing states’ rights to create their own firearms laws,” MacArthur said in a statement. “Opponents of this bill will argue that this legislation will enable dangerous people to obtain firearms. This is completely false. This bill, will allow a law-abiding citizen to carry concealed gun only if they are not federally prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm.”
The bill was also paired with an initiative to better report legal and mental health records to the background check system, an effort to win over Democrats. However, the legislation only drew the support of six Democrats nationally, none of them from New Jersey. Two New Jersey Republican House members –Reps. Leonard Lance (R-7) and Chris Smith (R-4)– voted no on the legislation, the first gun-related bill to be put up for a House vote since the deadly October mass shooting in Las Vegas. They were among 14 national Republicans to vote no on the bill. The bill is a top priority of the National Rifle Association.
“The first concrete action this body has taken in response the numerous gun tragedies our nation has experienced is to make it easier for people to carry hidden, loaded guns in our communities,” said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), a New Jersey Democrat who has strongly opposed efforts to loosen gun restrictions. “The irony is not lost on me; this bill epitomizes federal overreach and undermines states’ rights to regulate firearms – especially in states like New Jersey who have made tremendous progress to limit the proliferation of guns,” she said.
Many New Jersey districts are a top priority for national Democrats looking to shift control of the House during the 2018 midterm elections. Mikie Sherrill, the most successful fundraiser currently facing Frelinghuysen, quickly issued a statement opposing his vote on the bill. Sherill is a Navy veteran and former federal prosecutor.
“Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen just voted in favor of a bill that puts the people of New Jersey at risk of more violence in their communities,” Sherrill said. “The Congressman voted to make the job of our law enforcement agencies more difficult and to allow untrained and potentially dangerous individuals to carry concealed weapons in New Jersey. It is shameful that in a year with two of the worst mass shootings on record, the only response from Congress is eroding sensible gun laws.”
Ahead of the vote, former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords’s pro-gun control organization held a press conference in Morristown calling on Frelinghuysen to vote no on the bill. Giffords was the victim of a shooting in 2011. The group –Giffords– also ran tv ads this week informing voters that the bill would allow “nearly anyone with hidden, loaded guns would be allowed into communities.”

31,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/b6OPrICUQt0/,"In the five years since the deadly mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, scientists have been studying how Americans respond to these high-profile tragedies. Their findings show patterns in the way we buy and think about guns. Researchers have noted jumps in gun purchases and gun company stocks after nearly every major mass shooting, including in San Bernardino, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando and in Las Vegas. According to a new study, the number of guns purchased during the first five months following the Sandy Hook school shooting spiked by 3 million. But what drives this trend? Some psychologists think it might have to do with a phenomenon known as availability bias. This way of thinking causes us to dwell on a situation, often due to recent, extensive media coverage and an increase in discussion. Related StorySome Physicians Want Gun Violence Labeled A Public Health Issue Availability bias might lead people to purchase firearms for their own protection, due to the fears of gun violence that mass shootings can induce. It can also drive people to acquire guns out of fear that the mass shooting will incite action for stricter gun control, making it harder for them to purchase a firearm. This might also explain why the spike in gun purchases was smaller following the Las Vegas shooting than after those in San Bernardino and Orlando — then-President Barack Obama was more vocal about gun control than President Donald Trump. But the increase in gun sales doesn't necessarily mean more Americans own firearms. According to a recent Gallup poll, about 42 percent of Americans own a gun, while 3 percent of Americans own a majority of the country's firearms. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

The Texas boy’s grandmother, Sandy Ward, is asking their community to send Christmas cards to Ryland to keep him in a joyful spirit after she saw her grandson’s face light up when he was recently surprised with a holiday delivery, according to multiple local news outlets. “They still haven’t told [Ryland] yet that his mom and sisters are dead, but I’m sure he’s kind of getting some kind of idea because he’s 5,” Sandy told ABC affiliate KSAT on Tuesday. Ryland’s stepmother, Joann, and her daughters, Brooke Ward, 5, and 7-year-old Emily Garza, were killed in the Nov. 5 attack, the state’s deadliest mass shooting in modern history. Ryland continues to receive medical treatments after he was shot once in the elbow, twice in the stomach and twice in the leg by a gunman who opened fire at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, where his family members were regular parishioners. RELATED GALLERY: High-School Sweethearts, Mothers and Young Kids: The Worshipers Killed in Texas Church Massacre On Tuesday, the child’s family shared a health update on the child’s GoFundMe page. “Ryland’s surgery today to put a stint in his kidney was a success. If it holds, it will remain in place 6 weeks. Please pray it holds and that he will not lose a kidney. This young warrior has many battles to overcome,” the statement read. However, his injuries remain in severe condition. “Ryland’s femur bone is still separated and he will be in a wheel chair or wagon for months for mobility,” a statement earlier this month described. “Tummy has not healed … His hip and leg will still need additional surgeries and require screws, pins, plates and rods. He will remain in ICU until some of the tubes are removed.” Ryland’s eldest sister Rianna, 9, who was also at the church during the attack, had a bullet graze off her glasses but survived the shooting, according to their great-uncle, Gary Zwicke, who previously spoke with PEOPLE about the horrific tragedy.

39,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-new-mexico-school-shooting-20171208-story.html,"AZTEC, N.M. — A 21-year-old gunman who disguised himself as a student to get into a New Mexico high school where he killed two students had caught the attention of U.S. investigators more than a year ago, authorities said Friday. William Atchison, a former student at small-town Aztec High School, had legally purchased a handgun at a local store a month ago and planned the attack, authorities said. He left a message on a thumb drive found on his body that detailed his plan to wait until the students got off buses and made their way to class. He mingled with students, then walked into school with them and went into a second-floor bathroom to ""gear up."" Atchison's plan was to shoot up a classroom and then kill himself. ""Work sucks, school sucks, life sucks. I just want out of this (expletive),"" he wrote. More lives could have been lost had Francisco I. Fernandez not walked into the bathroom, authorities said. The gunman shot Fernandez, then walked out into the hallway and encountered the second victim, Casey J. Marquez. He immediately killed her. Atchison then walked up and down the hall, firing randomly, before killing himself, authorities said. ""He was determined to create as much carnage as he possibly could,"" San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen said. The shooter did not have a criminal record, much less a traffic ticket, officials said. The only contact with law enforcement was what they described as a generic message on an online gaming forum in 2016 in which he talked about what weapons might be used in a mass shooting. The FBI said the posting was flagged and investigators talked with the gunman at his home in Aztec, where he lived with his parents. At the time, he did not own any weapons other than an airsoft pellet gun and said he had no plans for an attack and just liked to troll sites online.

William Atchison, a former student at small-town Aztec High School, had legally purchased a handgun at a local store a month ago and planned the attack, authorities said. He left a message on a thumb drive found on his body that detailed his plan to wait until the students got off buses and made their way to class. He walked into the school with them and went into a second-floor bathroom to “gear up.” Atchison’s plan was to shoot up a classroom and then kill himself. “Work sucks, school sucks, life sucks. I just want out of this (expletive),” he wrote. More lives could have been lost had Francisco I. Fernandez not walked into the bathroom, authorities said. That’s when the gunman shot Fernandez. Atchison walked out into the hallway and encountered the second victim, Casey J. Marquez, and killed her. The gunman then walked up and down the hall, firing randomly, before killing himself, authorities said. “This is an act of cowardice,” San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen said. Authorities said the shooter did not have a criminal record, much less a traffic ticket. The only contact with law enforcement was what they described as a generic message on an online gaming forum in 2016 in which he talked about what weapons might be used in a mass shooting. The FBI said the posting was flagged and investigators talked with the gunman at his home in Aztec, where he lives with his parents. At the time, he did not own any weapons other than an airsoft pellet gun and said he had no plans for an attack and just liked to troll sites online.

43,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/09/newtown-sandy-hook-gun-control-washington,"Newtown shooting shocked the world – yet gun control seems further away than ever. But a band of loyal activists are convinced the fight is winnable First published on Sat 9 Dec 2017 12.00 GMT When concerned families from Newtown, Connecticut, first came to Washington five years ago, every door was open. This year, the room they had reserved for a press-conference on Capitol Hill was double-booked. They were shifted to a room half the size and only a single TV camera showed up to cover the emotional stories of dozens of gun violence survivors who had flown in from across the country.  Members of Congress only agreed to set up meetings with their direct constituents, and many simply offered a briefing with a staffer. The only lawmakers who spoke at the annual vigil to honor gun violence victims were from Connecticut. Sandy Hook has become synonymous with a cynicism about America’s escalating gun violence problem; if Americans could not pass stricter gun laws after 20 children were shot dead in their elementary school classrooms, then they would never act. But Newtown’s activists have not given up. On Wednesday, a week before the fifth anniversary of the shooting, a group of more than 40 local residents and their allies met in the early morning darkness behind the Newtown Municipal Center. They boarded a bus to Washington DC with snacks and pillows and stacks of pamphlets, some of them carrying the more formal clothes they would wear to the Capitol. In the darkness, one volunteer moved through the aisle, handing out homemade gingerbread muffins and slices of coffee cake baked by a neighbor who had not been able to come on the trip. The activists on the bus were not the parents of the 20 children and six educators killed. They were friends and neighbors and a few survivors, people who described how the horror of the shooting rippling outwards through the whole community, permanently changed them. There was Gina McDade, who had lived near the shooter and his mother. “I knew her as a mother and there were no signs that anything was wrong,” McDade said. “We can’t round up every angry kid. What we can control is guns.” The morning of the shooting in 2012, McDade had seen lines of Swat cars moving into her neighborhood. Six of the families who had lost their loved ones also lived in that same area, not far from where the shooter had lived. Each family was assigned a law enforcement detail. Even before the names of the victims had been publicly announced, “you saw the state trooper car in the driveway and you knew”. There was Kari Hulgaard, whose daughter, just before the massacre, had danced the Nutcracker with some of the kids from Sandy Hook, and Janice Bernard, who works in the children’s section of the local library, and seen the parents finally come in after the shooting, their faces still stunned and disbelieving. And there was Jackson Mittleman, 11 at the time, who had been in a school two miles away from Sandy Hook when the shooting happened. All he knew, at first, was that his school had gone into lockdown while he was in orchestra class. He put his violin aside and huddled with his classmates under and around the teacher’s desk. They stayed there for hours. Mittleman has vivid memories of the rest of that day: an early television report saying that at least 18 people were dead in a shooting at an elementary school just two miles from his school. Seeing two parents he knew, the Pozners, in the kitchen of a friend’s house. The Pozners had three kids who were students at Sandy Hook. They were just sitting there, saying nothing. Watching TV in the basement with his siblings that night as the president of the United States talked about what had happened in their town. The brutality of the attack shocked the world. In less than 11 minutes, a 20-year-old local man obsessed with mass shootings had burst into a Connecticut elementary school with an AR-15-style rifle and murdered 20 young children and six educators, including the school’s principal. Newtown was deluged with donations and calls and hand-drawn cards, as well as tens of thousands of teddy bears. When Mittleman went back to his school on Monday, there was a Swat team waiting outside. The streets of Newtown filled with news trucks, and on at least one day, news trucks and hearses. McDade opened her door to a single news reporter and in minutes found herself lit by the glare of television lights. “It still felt like it was happening for a while,” Mittleman said. Local residents said it took about year for Newtown for feel anything close to normal, and that it’s still not quite back yet. As the sun rose on the bus to Washington, Po Murray, the chairman of the Newtown Action Alliance, which organized the trip, rallied the women at the front of the bus. “Can I put you ladies to work?” she asked. “Here are the staplers.” The volunteers begin working through the stacks of form letters to legislators, to be stapled delivered in person over the next two days. Later, Murray talked through the four current gun bills the group supported and they two they opposed. “It’s like doing a high school project,” a volunteer quipped. “Lobbying for dummies,” someone said. Since Donald Trump, the National Rifle Association’s chosen candidate, won the White House, backed by more than $30m in support from the NRA, an already uphill battle for gun control laws has become even harder. After a mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, a White House spokeswoman emphasize the importance of not passing gun control laws. As the gun control campaigners arrived in Washington, after years of preparation, House Republicans were poised to vote on the NRA’s “no 1 legislative priority.” The federal law would tear down local restrictions and requirements for carrying guns in public, and make it possible for tourists from other states to carry their guns in Los Angeles restaurants or on the New York City subway, and for residents of states with strict gun laws to simply shop around for an easier state to issue them a gun-carrying permit. Local police chiefs across the country lined up against the bill, saying it would be an enforcement nightmare for officers on the street. Republicans, in contrast, argued that the policy would only make America safer, by making it easier for armed citizens to confront violent threats. The vote on this NRA-backed “concealed carry reciprocity” bill had been scheduled for the same day the Newtown group arrived in Washington for their annual vigil, which Democratic lawmakers criticized as shameful and insulting. The Newtown bus pulled up at the Capitol, and advocates hurried up the steps towards a patch of grass in front of the House of Representatives. Those protesting the NRA’s attempt to eviscerate local gun control laws included gun violence survivors from Chicago, the sister of the school psychologist killed at Sandy Hook, family members of people who had used guns to kill themselves, and women who had escaped domestic violence. For survivors who had been shot themselves, the risk of the law was particularly immediate: domestic violence survivors in particular often move to states with tougher gun laws to protect themselves, said Maj Sabrina Tapp-Harper of the Baltimore city sheriff’s department. This law would undo their protections. That same day, thousands of protesters pushing to restore legal protections for young undocumented immigrants had massed on the steps of the Capitol, leading to almost 200 arrests. But most of America’s gun control groups have yet to embrace civil disobedience. The gun control protest against the NRA’s number one priority piece of legislation was small and decorous. There was a careful selection of more pro-gun advocates of gun control, including a rancher from New Mexico in a cowboy hat and a former rear admiral from the US Navy. Tiffany Starr, who had come to Washington from New Jersey for her first day of gun violence prevention advocacy, had tried to sway a vote on the NRA-backed bill. Her congressman, Rodney Frelinghuysen, was a vulnerable Republican facing re-election next year. He had been targeted by a gun control group with ads urging him to vote against the NRA bill. Starr and a fellow survivor met with one of Frelinghuysen’s staffers and shared their stories as gun violence survivors. Starr’s father had been killed in 1994 when her sister’s abusive ex-boyfriend shot his way into their house looking for her. Their father had pushed her sister out of the way, and then been shot himself, giving his wife and daughters just enough time to run and hide in a neighbor’s house. Frelinghuysen’s staffer listened politely. The meeting was “short and sweet” but the experience was “very depressing,” Starr said. Two survivors had explained why the law would make them feel unsafe, they had described their terrible, first-hand experiences of gun violence. But there still didn’t seem to be any opening for reconsidering the lawmaker’s position. Starr and a group of other survivors had gone through several Capitol metal detectors and into the gallery overlooking the House floor to watch the vote on the NRA bill. The women looked down on the sea of blue and gray suits, the silver hair of the hundreds of white men of the House of Representatives, the scattered red suits and dresses of the female members. “I’m pretty sure” that Frelinghuysen’s voting yes to support the NRA’s bill, Starr said. The women were staring at the screens showing the vote count on the bill. “I think the vote’s done. I think it’s done. He did vote yes,” she said. The concealed carry bill had advanced to the Senate, where it was seen as unlikely to get very far, by a margin of 231-198. “What I want to know is why it’s so noisy,” Teresa Piliero said, as they got up to go. The chatter on the House floor, as members milled about, talking to each other, had gone on unabated as the NRA bill passed. Newtown residents were still pushing through the halls of Congress on Thursday, weary staffers listening to their pitch, as the news broke of another school shooting, this one in New Mexico. Three students, including the shooter, were dead. It was such a small school shooting, in a day of scandal and resignation in Washington and fires in California, that it barely registered on the news. Small shootings now were met with resignation. Trump had said, after the Las Vegas shooting, that “we pray for the day when evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear,” but gun control advocates were tired of thoughts and prayers and losing votes. The NRA’s push for its guns-everywhere bill was winning in Washington, but it had started the fight three decades earlier in the states, where advocates had succeeded in liberalizing laws for gun carrying, one state at a time. Gun control advocates have more recently made the same strategic move to the states, and there they were seeing small victories. Chris Hurst, the boyfriend of Alison Parker, a journalist who had been shot to death on live television in 2015, had decided to quit his own job as a reporter and run for state office in Virginia against an NRA-backed opponent. He had won. In his speech to other gun violence prevention advocates at a vigil, Hurst praised another survivor who was now running for state office in Georgia: Lucia McBath, the mother of Jordan Davis, a black teenager who had been shot to death by a white man after the man told him he was playing his music too loudly at a gas station. All night, advocates kept coming up to Hurst, exclaiming “Wow!” and offering hugs. Asked what advice he had for fellow survivors who wanted to run for office, Hurst said: “Trust in your strength.”",2017-12-09 07:00:06,"Five years on, Sandy Hook campaigners refuse to give up despite Washington inertia",,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

X OUR PICKS: BAGHDAD — After more than three years of combat operations, Iraq announced Saturday that the fight against the Islamic State group is over after the country’s security forces drove the extremists from all of the territory they once held. Iraqi and American officials warned, however, that key challenges remain despite the military victory. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally announced the victory in an address to the nation aired on Iraqi state television Saturday evening. “Honorable Iraqis, your land has been completely liberated,” he said. “The liberation dream has become a reality. We achieved victory in difficult circumstances and with God’s help, the steadfastness of our people and the bravery of our heroic forces we prevailed.” “The flag of Iraq is flying high today over all Iraqi territory and at the farthest point on the border,” he added, standing before the most senior members of Iraq’s security forces. Following al-Abadi’s remarks, his office declared a public holiday Sunday in celebration of the victory, according to an official statement from the prime minister’s office. Related Articles

			Pelosi says ‘deadly serious’ Jan. 6 probe to go without GOP Iraqi forces mopped up the last pockets of ISIS fighters from Iraq’s western deserts Saturday, securing the country’s border with Syria, a step that marked the end of combat operations against the extremists. “All Iraqi lands are liberated from terrorist Daesh gangs and our forces completely control the international Iraqi-Syrian border,” said Lt. Gen. Abdul-Amir Rasheed Yar Allah, a senior Iraqi military commander, in a statement Saturday afternoon.
The U.S. applauded the prime minister’s announcement. The U.S. offers “sincere congratulations to the Iraqi people and to the brave Iraqi Security Forces, many of whom lost their lives heroically fighting ISIS,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a written statement. “Our coalition will continue to stand with Iraq to support its security forces, economy and stabilization to help ensure that ISIS can never against threaten Iraq’s people or use its territory as a haven,” said Brett McGurk, U.S. special presidential envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, in a statement posted to his official Twitter account. “We mark today’s historic victory mindful of the work that remains,” he added. Iraq’s government remains faced with significant security threats, an economic crisis and the enormous task of rebuilding swaths of territory decimated by the ISIS fight. ISIS fighters overran nearly a third of Iraqi territory, including Mosul, the country’s second largest city and Tikrit, the capital of Iraq’s central Salahuddin province in the summer of 2014. The following year, IS fighters also overran Anbar’s provincial capital of Ramadi. Over the past 3½ half years, Iraqi ground forces closely backed by the U.S.-led coalition and mostly Shiite paramilitary forces backed by Iran have slowly retaken all of that territory. The pace of the anti-ISIS operation accelerated last year as coalition-backed Iraqi ground forces prepared for the assault on Mosul that was formally launched in October 2016. After more than nine months of mostly grueling urban combat, Al-Abadi declared victory over ISIS in Mosul in July. In the months that followed Iraqi forces retook a handful of other IS held towns including Tal Afar in August, Hawija in September and Qaim in October. In November, Iraqi forces retook the last Iraqi town held by IS — Rawah, near the border with Syria. However, ISIS fighters remain capable of carrying out insurgent attacks in Iraq, and the group has recovered from past setbacks.
IS insurgent networks continue to pose a threat to Baghdad and other Iraqi cities, a senior Iraqi security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The official said intelligence gathering would become increasingly important in the post-military phase of the fight against ISIS. “The triumph of military operations alone is not enough without stability,” government spokesman Saad al-Hadithi said, explaining that rebuilding in the wake of military victories against IS remained a “big challenge” for the Iraqi government. Additionally, some 3 million Iraqis remain displaced by the fight against ISIS, according to the United Nations. Al-Abadi also remains faced with a political and military stand-off with the country’s Kurdish region over a referendum held on independence. Federal government troops remain deployed throughout a string of disputed territories claimed by both Baghdad and Iraq’s Kurds — who were also backed by U.S.-led coalition forces in the fight against ISIS. While Baghdad and Irbil have both stated a willingness to talk, negotiations to end the dispute have not yet begun.

Fortunately, he is now OK. I belong to a religious congregation of around 35 families. One of the women in my congregation and I are also part of another (affiliated) group. At a meeting of the group, I mentioned the shooting to this woman. She said I should contact the president of the organization. I received much warmth and support from members of this group. The president sent a memo to the entire religious congregation — I know this because I am on the email list. What happened next? Nothing! Not one person contacted me to see if he was OK, if I was OK, etc. I am very hurt. Part of me wants to just silently quit the congregation. Part of me wants to tell them how hurt I was (even though shooting off my mouth has gotten me trouble all during my life), and then quit the congregation, and part of me wants to carry on like nothing happened. Your advice? — Troubled Dear Troubled: You should reach out to your clergy member regarding your concern. Say that your family has been through a frightening, dramatic and traumatic event, and that you would appreciate support during this challenging time. Be frank and respectful with clergy when you describe your disappointment, even after this email went out. This is very much a pastoral matter, and your clergy should explain why your needs have been neglected, thus far. This monstrous gunman killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others, many of whom are still trying to recover. You might take this opportunity to inspire the congregation not only to care more fully about you, but to extend their compassion to the scores of other family members affected by this senseless tragedy. After you talk with clergy, you might inspire the congregation by sharing the opportunity to donate to the “Music City Cares Fund,” established by the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee (cfmt.org). This highly rated foundation has pledged that 100 percent of donations made to the Music City Cares Fund will go directly to families impacted by the worst mass shooting in American history. You don’t say what your faith practice is, but you should consider the possibility that many of them have lifted up private thoughts to you. The test for you is to see if you can get what you need by asking for it (instead of “shooting your mouth off”). I hope your faith community rises to this simple challenge with compassion. Dear Amy: My wife is a very opinionated person. She has no social filters. On her son’s (my stepson’s) wedding day, she began drinking, etc., in mid-morning, along with some of the others in the bridal party. Without going into explicit detail, I learned after the fact that my wife took the bride aside just before she was due to walk down the aisle, and said she didn’t believe that the bride really loved her son, but was only marrying him for his money. In the days following the wedding my wife confirmed those feelings to me, yet, now, (weeks later) she denies ever saying those words to the bride. Apparently, though, at least one other person overheard and confirmed what was said, and shared this with the groom. Understandably, the newlyweds don’t want anything to do with my wife, and I’m left trying to mend fences. Thoughts? — Mending Dear Mending: In the unlikely event of the couple coming to you and asking for reconciliation, you should dive in and try to bring all parties together, in person, to talk this out. Otherwise, you should continue to tell your wife that she owes her daughter-in-law (and son) an apology, preferably in writing. What she did was unconscionable. I hope it wasn’t unforgivable. Your wife has a big problem. No filter plus alcohol plus denial equals unhappy ending. Dear Amy: Recently you have included letters from people who have cancer and parts of your responses were along the lines that it looked like they would beat it. As you know, everybody does not survive cancer and I don’t think this is appropriate coming from you, rather than their medical team. — Concerned Dear Concerned: I am applauding those who write to share that their treatment seems to be working. For many, cancer is becoming a chronic disease. None of us survives this life. And cancer exacts a terrible toll, but I believe that this is fairly common knowledge.

He graduated from the police academy and then, nine and a half years ago, took a job with the Eatonville Police Department, where he remained “because they were the first ones who gave [him] the opportunity.” But now, the 45-year-old corporal is saying he was dismissed from the force Monday — six months before he was due to be vested in its pension system — because he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after being one of the first to respond to the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen opened fire and took hostages at the LGBT-friendly nightclub, killing 49 people and injuring dozens more. At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Delgado returned to patrol duty for a few months after the shooting, but said he decided to stop. For the past eight months, he has been working a desk job answering phones, recording fingerprints and completing similar administrative tasks. And on Tuesday night, the Eatonville Town Council voted unanimously to pay Delgado $1,200 before taxes in accrued sick time, and designated Dec. 31 as his last day of work, The Orlando Sentinel reported.

It’s a challenge to try and explain something like that to a 9-year-old and a 10-year-old.” Delgado said he will begin receiving 42 percent of his $38,500 annual salary a decade from now, when he’s 55 years old. The Eatonville Police Department did not respond to repeated requests for comment by NBC News. Angel Colon, who was rescued by Delgado after being shot six times during the massacre, denounced the department for terminating the man who saved him. Related: Pulse nightclub survivor takes the stage more than a year after shooting “He saved my life and for them to just do what they're doing to him in front of my face is a slap to my face as well,” Colon told WFTV. “He did his job that night on June 12, so they should have his back 100 percent.” Ever since the massacre, Delgado has regularly woken up screaming after having the same nightmare about the carnage he witnessed that night in Orlando. He said he can only sleep between three and five hours each night — even on medication. “After that night, it was hell,” Delgado said. “Just trying to continue my life with visions of what I witnessed. No man should ever have to do that.” The officer said he has difficulty being in bars, restaurants or anywhere that’s noisy with crowds of people. He said he constantly fears that an event similar to the massacre will happen wherever he goes. “I just don’t live my life the way I did before what happened at Pulse,” Delgado said. “I feel bad, and I can see myself deteriorating away because I don’t do the things I enjoyed doing before. I’d rather be home — I’d rather stay in my room.” Related: First responders face PTSD risk after Vegas shooting According to Florida state law, workers who endure psychological trauma on the job are not entitled to paid days off or medical bill reimbursement by their employers. But a new bill that advanced in the Florida Senate Tuesday might lead to a policy change. Senate Bill 376 would require coverage for PTSD treatment in workers’ compensation insurance for first responders who witnessed or responded to the scene of a child death, murder, suicide, fatal injury or mass-casualty incident. On Wednesday, multiple Central Florida lawmakers responded to Delgado's termination by calling for workers’ compensation for first responders coping with work-related mental health issues. Shortly after learning of his dismissal, Delgado said he received an outpouring of support from friends, family and community members. A GoFundMe account that was created on his behalf had collected more than $35,000 as of Friday morning. Delgado said he is grateful for the support, but still wishes he had his job — especially now during the holiday season. “You expect your country to take care of you,” he said. “I thought my department would’ve taken care of me, and that’s not the case.” Dan Corey is an associate segment producer for MSNBC. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2017-12-10 15:48:24,Officer with PTSD from Pulse massacre loses his job,,34663,http://www.breakingnews.com#spider

Each time, the grieving families have waited for the reports showing that the shooter had not simply snapped: that there were warning signs missed, red flags that got no response. To mark the fifth anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, a nonprofit founded by some of the family members of victims is releasing a new video with the message that it is possible to see the signs of a potential act of violence ahead of time – and that it is crucial to act on them. The new video ad follows Evan, a viral video released last year by Sandy Hook Promise, which said it received more than 150 million views. The new ad “does have an emotional gut punch”, said Nicole Hockley, one of the co-founders of Sandy Hook Promise, who lost her six-year-old son Dylan in the shooting. “We don’t want people to be comfortable around the subject of gun violence,” she said. Sandy Hook Promise has trained more than 2.5 million students and adults across the country in its “Know the Signs” programs, which it offers free of cost to local school districts. The programs are designed to help kids and adults recognize the signs of someone who might be at risk of harming themselves or others, and know how to report them to someone who will take action. The programs are continuing to expand to school districts across the country, and the new video is designed to raise money to continuing to fund the expansion of the trainings. Sandy Hook Promise, which does not represent all 26 families, also advocates for mental health reform and has endorsed a slate of local and federal gun control laws. New national gun control laws have been blocked by Republicans in Congress, and are now opposed by Donald Trump, who sees himself as a close ally of the National Rifle Association, the nation’s leading gun rights group.",2017-12-11 14:07:08,Sandy Hook families post video on how to spot signs of potential mass shooting,"education and schools,advertising and marketing,recordings (audio),crime and criminals,children and youth,murders and attempted murders",1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

55,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/sheryl-crow-song-sandy-hook-gun-control-dreaming-kind,"Crow, who is releasing a song dedicated to Newtown victims, says country musicians are afraid of speaking about gun laws and losing their audience Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.15 BST Money and fear have kept country music artists from speaking out about gun laws, the nine-time Grammy Award-winner Sheryl Crow said, even after thousands of country fans were targeted in October in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.  “You would think after Vegas we would see some leadership from our country community,” Crow told the Guardian. “But all I can say about that is if there’s money involved, and fear, these conversations come to a screeching halt. “There’s no one that I know of in the popular country world that is willing to step out and really to take a stand on this, and that’s really unfortunate. “I hope there will be people who find a way out of their fear, who stick up for humanity as opposed to sticking with their fanbase or the money that can come along with having those large crowds.” Crow’s new song, The Dreaming Kind, released on Monday, is a tribute to the 20 young children and six adults who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut five years ago. Proceeds from downloads of the song will benefit Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit founded by several family members of the shooting victims that has trained more than 2.5 million students and adults to identify signs of at-risk behavior before it leads to violence. The song was inspired by Crow’s “real sense of helplessness” after the Las Vegas shooting, her frustration with America’s toxic gun debate and her struggle with how to tell her two sons, aged 10 and seven, about mass shootings that targeted kids like them as well as music lovers like their mother and her fans. “It’s a horrible feeling for my kids to not even be able to know what happened at Sandy Hook,” Crow said, “for fear they’ll walk into school and think they’re not in a safe place, or that mom will go to work and there’s a chance she may not come home if there’s somebody in the audience with a gun.” She tried to protect her two sons as much as possible from seeing news about the Las Vegas shooting on 1 October, she said, an effort made easier by the fact that her two boys are young enough not to have their own phones. Three days before her Sandy Hook tribute song was slated to debut on ABC’s Good Morning America, she told the Guardian, she still had not sat down with her children to explain what had happened at the elementary school in Newtown. Even contemplating that conversation left her shaken. “I think they won’t understand,” she said. “I’m not even able to fathom that.” After the Las Vegas shooting, Caleb Keeter, a guitarist who played at the Route 91 concert which was targeted, shared a viral post explaining how the experience had profoundly changed his opinion on gun rights. “We need gun control,” he wrote, “RIGHT. NOW.” Roseanne Cash wrote an op-ed challenging country artists to speak out against the National Rifle Association and to break the cozy relationship between country artists and the gun rights group. “There is no other way to say this,” Cash wrote. “The NRA funds domestic terrorism.” But mainstream stars have not come forward to start a conversation on how to strike a better balance between gun rights and the right to go to a concert or a movie theater without the fear of being targeted, Crow said. “I think it’s fear-based, this fear of losing your audience, this fear of pissing off your audience,” she said. Crow said she knows that speaking out about gun violence and gun laws will spark a new round of online harassment and vitriol. “My stance on it is very unpopular,” she said. “I’m a person just like everyone else is, and I’m not above being really hurt.” But, she said, “I want to see us do better, I want to see us as the country we were meant to be. “The emotional terrorism that is being wielded from the White House down has everyone so on edge that it’s robbed us of our ability to have reasonable conversations, where we sit in a room and we’re able to discuss these very important topics with people we don’t necessarily agree with. “As artists, I feel like we really have to show up in this, in all the areas that are hard for us. We need to write songs that talk about these issues. We need to write songs about what’s happening in our communities – the injustices, the people who feel left out. “Outside of Bruce Springsteen, who writes for these people?” Too many artists are putting out “the same song over and over, because it’s paying for the big houses”, Crow said. “Our fans need to know that we care about them.” Crow’s new song is more grieving than confrontational. She said she saw writing a benefit song for a Sandy Hook nonprofit as “an opportunity to be proactive in a way that’s completely non-political, that’s completely compassion based”. For the Sandy Hook parents and family members who listen to the song she said, she hopes that “perhaps there’s a little bit of comfort in it. Perhaps there’s just a moment of being transported away from the experience, and feeling there is something larger at play.” Nicole Hockley, a co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, lost her six-year-old son Dylan at Sandy Hook. She has become a full-time advocate for violence prevention. She said she cried the first time she listened to Crow’s song, and that “it is constantly, constantly in my head now”. “When I wake up in the morning it’s the first thing I listen to,” she said.",2017-12-12 06:00:32,Sheryl Crow criticizes country stars for not 'taking a stand' on gun control,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
56,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sandy-hook-how-newtown-coping-five-years-after-massacre-n828591?cid=public-rss_20171213," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News NEWTOWN, Conn. — ""Twelve-fourteen"" is shorthand for enduring pain in this town. Say those numbers and a knowing look passes across the faces of residents who were here when Adam Lanza murdered 20 first-graders and six school staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School with a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle. Say those numbers and the past is cleaved into before and after, the way “9/11” still does for many Americans. On Thursday, it will be five years since Newtown became the unwilling epicenter of an ongoing national tragedy — the mass killing of innocents by gunmen armed with high-powered weapons. Some things have changed since then in this old New England town, which was built by English colonists on land purchased from the Pootatuck Native American tribe back in 1705. Several thousand more people, undeterred by what happened on Dec. 14, 2012, now call Newtown their home. Related: How the Sandy Hook massacre changed school security The scene of Lanza’s horrific crime is no more, and a new school has arisen in its place. The white frame house with green shutters on Yogananda Street where Lanza lived and claimed his first victim — his mother — has been demolished. But Newtown is still coming to grips with its bitter legacy. City leaders and residents say they refuse to be defined by the shooting. And yet, as interviews reveal, it is a town still mending. It is a town in which many are dismayed that the murders of so many children failed to stop the epidemic of deadly mass shootings that continues to plague America. Mary Ann Jacob, a Sandy Hook library clerk who is credited with saving the lives of 18 fourth-graders, likened Newtown to “an old-fashioned scale.” “Sometimes it’s heavier with grief, sometimes it’s lighter,” she told NBC News. “But it’s always sort of on your shoulder and right there.” Michael Kehoe, who was chief of police and one of the first witnesses to the aftermath of the massacre, echoed Jacob. ""Because I'm retired, I don’t have to help prepare the community for the anniversary,"" Kehoe said. ""But I'm aware of 12/14. I can’t help being aware."" Earlier this month, the city held its annual tree lighting. In the years after Lanza, it became a kind of unofficial reminder for many about how the unthinkable had happened just as Newtown was gearing up for what for many should be the happiest time of the year. “Sometimes it’s heavier with grief, sometimes it’s lighter. But it’s always sort of on your shoulder and right there.” This year, the city is also hosting a photo exhibit at the municipal center to mark the day. But beyond that there will be no speeches, no official memorial service. “The community will engage in private reflection and remembrance,” said Lorrie Rodrigue, the town’s interim schools superintendent. But there will be a poignant moment for anybody within earshot of downtown Newtown. At 9:36 a.m. Thursday, the same time that Lanza started shooting, the bells at St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church will start ringing. They will be rung 26 times, once for each victim. Kehoe remembers what he saw in the classrooms not long after Lanza ended the rampage by shooting himself in the head. What he doesn’t remember are the nightmares that followed. Related: List of deadliest mass shootings in U.S. modern history In the chaotic weeks after the shooting, as Kehoe was leading his traumatized officers and trying to keep the peace in a town turned upside down by tragedy, he would scream in his sleep. “I don’t recall them at all,” the former Newtown police chief said, when asked about the terrifying dreams. “I think it was just shouting.” It was his wife, Laraine, who heard the screams and urged him to get help. The 45 other Newtown police officers under his command were also coping with the stress. “Can’t we stop this as a society? We Americans seem to have cornered the market on these kind of mass killings.” “I think that we were exceptionally busy, and that kind of kept us focused on the real work at hand,” the former chief said. “I think internally we were suffering in some ways. ... I think the rank and file and staff really showed their mettle by doing their jobs as best they could.” Kehoe, who joined the department in July 1978, retired in January 2016. Six months later, he was on a plane to Dallas to help that city’s police force deal with trauma after five of their officers were killed by a gunman. Imparting the lessons he learned in Newtown to other cops has become Kehoe’s new calling. Some 15 percent of police officers will suffer post-traumatic stress in their careers, which can lead to depression, anxiety, alcoholism — even suicide, he said. Related: Police officer with PTSD from Pulse massacre loses job “There has been a cultural change in the way police officers deal with things like this,” he said. “It used to be grab a few beers and suck it up. Now, we get help.” Kehoe credits his wife and the counselors with helping him come to grips with his trauma. “I don’t think today I have any issues,” he said. But every time there is a mass shooting, like the recent church massacre in Texas, Kehoe admits he feels a pang. ""I kind of reflect on that and say, 'Boy I know what they are going through,'"" he said. “I always think about the first responders and the family members and the victims."" He said it troubles him that what happened in Newtown keeps happening elsewhere in America. “Can’t we stop this as a society?” he asked at one point. “We Americans seem to have cornered the market on these kind of mass killings.” Of late, Kehoe has been very conscious of the calendar. He said five years passed in the blink of an eye. How will he mark the day? “I will try to make it as normal as possible,” he said. “I learned that you have to adapt to a new normal. Obviously the event changes you. But I will try to keep it normal, with a soft reminder that on this day 26 people lost their lives. And I will say a prayer for them.” “I hate the word anniversary,” said Erin Nikitchyuk, a Sandy Hook parent. “This is not something that we celebrate.” It is a sentiment that is widespread in Newtown. And for Nikitchyuk, 48, Dec. 14 is an unwelcome reminder of how close she came to losing her son, Bear, who is now 13 years old. “He was in third grade,” she recalled. Related: FBI released 1,500 pages of documents on Sandy Hook massacre On the day of the shooting, she said, Bear and a classmate got picked to walk the attendance sheets to the principal’s office — a prized job for the kids at Sandy Hook Elementary School. They “turned around to go back down the hall when the window behind the entrance into the school was shot out, a couple of yards behind them.” Pandemonium ensued and Bear and the girl he was with were directly in the line of fire. “As fate would have it, one of the teachers saw through her narrow window him standing in the hallway waiting for the girl he was with to catch up,” she said. “And she opens her door and pulled them to safety.” The teacher, Abbey Clements, has been hailed as a hero. Nikitchyuk says Bear has been able to put the shooting behind him. “One of the things that people don’t realize about this kind of grief is it’s not always just the screaming and crying till it’s running down your face kind of grief. There’s very subtle ways that it changes you, too."" “I’m not sure how much of that is natural resilience and how much of that are the tools that his therapist helped him with. I don’t know why we were so lucky,"" she said. ""We have lots of people in town who are still struggling every day with anxiety and fear.” This time of year, Nikitchyuk said, many in Newtown put on a brave face. And because so many people have moved into town since the shooting, ""we’re a very different place than we were five years ago."" But the grief is still there, she said. “One of the things that people don’t realize about this kind of grief is, it’s not always just the screaming and crying till it’s running down your face kind of grief,” she said. “There’s very subtle ways that it changes you, too."" ""I know, for example, that many of us haven’t been able to read a book since the shooting,” she said. “I think only in the last nine months or so have I actually been able to pick up a book and read it because your whole brain is different."" Like other Newtown residents, Nikitchyuk is dismayed that the murders weren’t a catalyst for gun-law reform, such as banning high-powered rifles like the one Lanza used. She said she has no use at all for the so-called truthers who popped up on social media — and have even ventured into Newtown — to peddle the bogus theory that the massacre was staged by the government to push gun control. ""I fortunately have not had to face them,"" she said. ""But I do know that they’ve harassed people, families, and they’re just not welcome."" This is how Mark Barden remembers his 7-year-old son Daniel, one of the 20 first-graders killed on 12/14. “He was a smart, articulate little boy with a very developed sense of compassion and awareness of others,” he said. “And I mean everything from picking up worms off the sidewalk and putting them in the grass so the sun wouldn’t bake them and holding doors for strangers and connecting with fellow classmates. He spent his whole day kind of reaching out to other people and being a good citizen.” Now Barden is doing the same. He channeled his grief by founding a group with other heartbroken Newtown parents called Sandy Hook Promise, whose mission is advocating for sensible gun control and preventing massacres like the one that claimed his son. Barden, who grew up in Yonkers, New York, said both he and his Bronx-bred wife, Jackie, “were exposed to gun violence before.” “She had a gun battle happening right in front of her front steps,” Barden said. “We were held-up at gunpoint in another city together, and we never thought that we should do anything about it. Shame on us."" He added, ""It took the greatest tragedy for us to finally wake up and say this is not going to fix itself.” Since Sandy Hook, there have been more than 1,500 mass shootings in the U.S. that have claimed more than 1,700 lives — many of them children, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Each time it happens, Barden mourns anew. “I feel defeated,” he said. “I feel like I let those people down. I feel like I’m trying to honor Daniel, do this good work in his name. I feel like I’ve failed."" Related: Gun control is a public health issue, experts say Barden said that he was shocked in 2013 when the Democrat-led attempt to tighten firearms laws and ban assault weapons was scuttled by the National Rifle Association and its Republican allies in Congress. He said after the proposed legislation failed, Vice President Joe Biden called him to tell him he was sorry. It was after that debacle, Barden said, that they realized a change of tactics was needed. “We started examining the drivers of change, and we realized that we had to reach people a different way,” he said. Five years after the shooting, Sandy Hook Promise is operating programs nationwide that are aimed at preventing school shootings by educating parents and teachers about mental health while continuing to push for what Barden calls “sensible” gun safety laws. “We have brought bullying down to near zero in many schools,” he said. Come Thursday, though, Barden will do what he does every year on the anniversary of the shooting, as well as on Daniel’s birthday and other significant dates in his son's all-too-short life — hold his wife and other two children close and lay low until it passes. “I do find the weight of the significance of these dates,” he said. Eight of the 20 slain children and one of the murdered staffers were part of Monsignor Bob Weiss’ flock at St. Rose of Lima. And every year since, Weiss has celebrated a memorial Mass in their memory. This year, Weiss is handing off that responsibility to the bishop. “I guess I just still feel deeply the emotion of this,” he said. “I just knew that there’s no way I could really be an effective celebrant or homilist that night.” On that awful morning, Weiss said he was celebrating Mass when he was summoned to the school by a call from a state trooper. “I know the families have asked us not to call it an anniversary. That has a different connotation. So we’re calling ours, you know, a celebration of remembrance.” “It was very much like walking through a war zone,” he recalled. “I got up to the front of the school and one of the state police officers asked me if I would like to come in and give a blessing.” It would be the first of many Weiss would deliver as his town was engulfed by grief and he found himself and his faith tested like never before. “We had many of the wakes here in the church and then we had the burials and it went on for almost seven days,” he said. “The town just pulled itself together and it was so present to all those families.” After the funerals were over and the reporters left, Weiss said he and his flock were tested again. Many longtime parishioners began fleeing the town. Others struggled with alcoholism. He saw marriages break up because of the stress. In the last two years, Weiss said, Newtown has turned a corner. He said he has started seeing new faces at Mass. “Five years later there are definitely new families moving in,” he said. “There is a new spirit here.” When the shooting started, Mary Ann Jacob kept her cool and blocked the door to the library with a file cabinet, then huddled inside a supply closet with students for an hour until a police officer arrived. Then they crawled out of the library to safety. “You know, it still seems almost surreal that something so horrific happened in the elementary school that I worked in and where my kids went to school,” she said. But every time Jacob goes to the movies, the dread she felt that day comes roaring back, and she finds herself feeling trapped and checking for exits. “The weirdest part about it is, I look at the floor and think, 'Wow, that floor’s really gross and I have to get down on the floor,'” she said. “It’s weirdly rational.” Related: Fact check: No, more guns won't prevent mass shootings While Jacob has been hailed for her quick thinking, she says it was dumb luck that saved her and her charges. “We survived because we were lucky, not because we did some extraordinary thing,” she said. Maureen Will was supervising dispatchers at Newtown’s tiny 911 call center when the first reports of shots fired at Sandy Hook began coming in. Within minutes, the trickle turned into a torrent and Will was forced to pitch in and help the two overwhelmed dispatchers on the day shift. “We took over 300 calls an hour on our landline phones,” said Will. She said that because other schools had gone into lockdown, they got calls ""from parents, teachers who were on field trips, people that we knew who had kids in the school.” Dispatchers even got calls from police officers “who had children in our schools,” she said. That broke their hearts. “You can’t tell them anything, and they’d call you by your first name,” she said. “It was very difficult for us to maintain a professional demeanor. … But we did what we had to do, and it just seemed to go on for hours.” It was only later that what happened hit them. “I remember shutting my door and I called my best friend,"" Will said. ""I said to her ’I need help,’ and I broke down.” For Will, what happened at Sandy Hook literally hit home. “I don’t just live across the street from where the original school was,” she said. “I went to that school. My daughter went to that school.” Will said she will be at her post on Thursday, and she’ll be listening for the bells of St. Rose. “For me, the bells mean hope, rebirth, part of my Catholic upbringing,” she said. “The bells say what we need to say.” Erin Calabrese reported from Newtown, Connecticut, and Corky Siemaszko from New York City.

With the 30th pick of the 2021 NHL Draft, the Vegas Golden Knights have selected Zach Dean from the Gatineau Olympiques of the QMJHL.

The offseason is in full flight with the draft and free agency fast approaching. We continue our series which examines what each team needs to accomplish over the coming weeks and months. Next up is a look at Vegas. Last night as the Seattle Kraken unveiled their roster there was certainly a feeling of familiarity to when Vegas was on the clock four years ago. Sprinkled amongst the occasional household name were a group of players most common NHL fans had never heard of. The Vegas home opener is set for Oct. 12.

They both play on different coasts, the Golden Knights are built to win right now, and the Devils are way under the cap. One day left before the big reveal! The Seattle Kraken are in the process of building out their roster as the 32nd franchise in the National Hockey League. The Expansion Draft is officially underway and boy oh boy do the Seattle Kraken have some decisions to make. From Carey Price to Vladamir Tarasenko to Mark Giordano to free agents Gabriel Landeskog and Alex Ovechkin, the number of star players available to the NHL’s newest team seems almost unbelievable. Vegas also acquires Brett Howden from the Rangers in a separate deal. So much for the Golden Knights having a quiet day leading up to the NHL’s roster freeze ahead of the expansion draft. Even though Howden is a former top prospect, a first-round pick of the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2016, his offense has not translated to the pro game. Ellis had spent his entire 10-year career in Nashville. The 30-year-old amassed 270 points (75 goals, 195 assists) in 562 games.

Just before the NHL entered a transaction freeze that lasts through Wednesday’s expansion draft, the Nashville Predators, Philadelphia Flyers, and Vegas Golden Knights completed a trade with a slew of big names.

Rosters freeze in a couple of hours, expansion lists are due slightly after that and will be released to the public tomorrow. The 22-year-old is coming off his first full season in the NHL.

58,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/sandy-hook-fifth-anniversary-gun-control-chris-murphy,"As fifth anniversary of the mass shooting looms, outspoken gun critic Chris Murphy says Congress’s lack of results makes it difficult to face victims’ families First published on Wed 13 Dec 2017 11.00 GMT US senator Chris Murphy said he regrets that the Sandy Hook massacre, one of the deadliest school shootings in US history, has been followed by five years of political inaction, and that he finds it difficult to face victim’s families. “I’m always a little embarrassed when I go back to Newtown,” the Connecticut senator said in an interview, just ahead of the mass shooting’s anniversary. “I still feel awful that we haven’t enacted bigger national change.”  The school shooting on 14 December 2012, in which 20 children and six educators were murdered, proved to be a defining moment for Murphy. He had been elected senator a month earlier with no intention of leading an anti-gun violence movement. Few, if any, lawmakers would go on to devote as much time, energy and political capital toward the vexing issue of gun laws. “I view this as a long-term political and social movement that started in 2012 and needs time to build,” Murphy said. On Thursday, Murphy will reunite with some of the Newtown families while attending a mass of remembrance at a local church. It was one of several events Murphy participates in annually to mark the day when gunman Adam Lanza walked into the Sandy Hook elementary school and opened fire before claiming his own life. The aftermath remains seared in Murphy’s memory. He was poised to take his own young children to New York City that day to view the Christmas decorations when the call came in. Although he had not yet been sworn into the Senate, Murphy was closing out his term as a congressman whose district included Newtown. He was among the few who bore witness at a nearby firehouse when the victims’ families were told the unthinkable – that their children, all aged five and six, would not be returning home. Reuniting with some of those families on Thursday, Murphy said, will be “a very emotional night”. “Obviously, five years is a milestone, and I think it’s important that there’s some event in the community to remember what happened and to celebrate the lives we lost, but also the lives that have continued,” he said. The frustration in Murphy’s voice is nonetheless palpable when the conversation turns to gun control. There have been at least 1,552 mass shootings in the US since Sandy Hook, according to the Gun Violence Archive, with nearly 1,800 people killed and more than 6,000 wounded. “I do worry that everyone in this country is becoming desensitized to violence,” Murphy said. “The shooting now has to have double-digit casualties in order to make the news for more than an hour.” Even on Capitol Hill, the outcry with each shooting appears increasingly muted as a familiar pattern takes hold: Republicans offer “thoughts and prayers”, insisting it is too soon to politicize the tragedy by discussing gun control, while Democrats issue statements calling for action. Murphy, for his part, does not want to wait until the next massacre to weigh in. The senator routinely appears on the Senate floor to shine on a light on everyday gun violence and has delivered more than 50 speeches since taking office dubbed as “Voices of Victims”. Murphy’s activism has made him a frequent target of the NRA, but also positioned him as the Senate’s go-to lawmaker for gun violence survivors and the families of victims. It’s not (just) about the money. In 2017, the NRA spent at least $4.1m on lobbying – more than the $3.1m it spent in all of 2016. But for comparison, the dairy industry has spent $4.4m in the same period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). The National Association of Realtors, one of the biggest spenders, has paid out $32.2m lobbying on housing issues. The NRA has plenty of cash to spend. It bet big on the 2016 US elections, pouring $14.4m into supporting 44 candidates who won and $34.4m opposing 19 candidates who lost, according to CRP. But “the real source of its power, I believe, comes from voters,” said Adam Winkler, a UCLA professor of constitutional law. The 145-year-old organization claims 5 million active members, that number is disputed, but whatever its actual size, membership is a powerful tool, said Robert Spitzer, a professor at the State University of New York at Cortland. “They have a very powerful ability to mobilize a grassroots support and to engage in politics when most Americans can barely be bothered to vote,” he said. “And because so few Americans do those things, if you get a bunch of people in a locality who are all prepared to go out to a meeting they can have a big effect."" Read more Last week, a group of advocates sat around a large rectangular table in Murphy’s Capitol Hill office to share concerns over a concealed carry bill, passed by House Republicans, that would require states with stricter gun laws to honor permits from states with far looser requirements. Attendees ranged from a North Carolina woman whose sister was found dead due to a gunshot wound, to a mother who lost her young son in Hartford, Connecticut, to the regular gun violence that plagues urban cities across America. “Right now, as we sit here, people are dying,” said Samuel Saylor, a pastor from Hartford, whose own son was shot and killed in October of 2012. “I’ve buried a lot of kids since then.” Murphy has chosen to no longer mince his own words, often decrying Congress as “cowardly” and “complicit” in the face of America’s gun violence epidemic. On 15 June 2016, after a mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Murphy mounted a 15-hour filibuster on the Senate floor demanding stricter gun laws. Last month, the senator’s response to the massacre of 26 churchgoers at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, went viral for its scathing candor. “The paralysis you feel right now – the impotent helplessness that washes over you as news of another mass slaughter scrolls across the television screen – isn’t real,” Murphy said in a statement at the time. “It’s a fiction created and methodically cultivated by the gun lobby.” “None of this is inevitable,” he added. “It is uniquely and tragically American.” Murphy sounded a more optimistic tone when speaking with the Guardian. The Texas shooting may have provided the impetus for a breakthrough, he said, pointing to a compromise he subsequently struck with John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, on background checks. Cornyn, who represents Texas, teamed up with Murphy on legislation that would add new accountability measures to ensure that states and federal agencies are entering the proper records into the federal background checks system. “Republicans have always talked about enforcing existing laws, but they’ve never been willing to introduce legislation to do that until now,” Murphy said. “It’s significant that so many Republicans have been wiling to sign onto the bill,” he added. In 2013, only four Republicans crossed the aisle to support a measure expanding background checks in response to Sandy Hook. Four Democrats joined the remaining Republicans in the Senate to kill the compromise, which would have required background checks on all gun sales. Murphy’s bill with Cornyn is more modest in its scope, but he views it as a start. “The modern anti-gun violence movement didn’t begin until after Sandy Hook,” he said. “The gun lobby had a two-decade head-start on us.” Few issues have drawn as much cynicism as gun violence. The prevailing sentiment in Washington often remains that if the loss of 20 children wasn’t enough to spur meaningful action, it’s hard to fathom would will change. But Murphy unequivocally rejects that notion and pointed to the emergence of nonprofits, political action committees and a grassroots anti-gun violence movement to rival the NRA. “There’s a lot of miraculous things that have happened in the last five years in the wake of the slaughter,” Murphy said. “Every great social movement is defined by the hard times.”",2017-12-13 06:00:00,Connecticut senator 'embarrassed' at political inaction since Sandy Hook,"education and schools,politics and government,firearms,murders and attempted murders",1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
59,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/12/13/clint-eastwoods-1517-to-paris-gets-a-last-minute-trailer/,"'15:17 to Paris' With all the talk about Ridley Scott pulling magic out of his butt at the speed of light at the tender age of 80, Clint Eastwood is no slouch in that department either. The 87-year old icon is still putting out movies, and there aren't a lot of folks who can say that they directed the biggest hit of their lives, even adjusted for inflation, at the age of 84-years old. Say what you will about his politics and personal life, but I can only hope that when I'm 87-years old I'm healthy enough to watch a movie like 15:17 to Paris, let alone make one. 15:7 to Paris is an interesting little oddity. It is a fact-based docudrama about three American servicemen who thwarted a would-be mass shooting on a passenger train back in 2015. The odd thing is that the three leads will be played by the actual Americans who rushed to the rescue on that fateful August day. That by itself makes this a genuine curiosity, if only to see how these three non-actors pull off essentially playing themselves. To be fair, Act of Valor pulled off a similar trick in early 2012, casting (anonymous) Navy Seals as actual Navy Seals in an action-movie throwback thriller. And, yeah, it certainly helped the movie stand out from the crowd. Of course, Act of Valor was nearly six years ago, and I'm less optimistic about the financial chances of a movie like this then I was back in the day. The film is going to be in a marketplace much less friendly to movies not in the tentpole/franchise realm, where folks are less likely to go to the movies just toe go to the movies. Of course, Eastwood being Eastwood, I'd be shocked if this movie were anything resembling expensive, so even a performance on par with Micahel Bay's 13 Hours would probably be okay. Quality wise, I can only hope that its absence from the Oscar season is more about confidence in Chris Nolan's Dunkirk (or, ha ha, Wonder Woman) than dissatisfaction with this Eastwood venture. Fair or not, this movie is going to be discussed along political lines. Yes, it stinks that a story of American servicemen performing an act of heroism (one that, it should be noted, resulted in zero fatalities) against armed baddies should be taken as more-or-less ""Red State entertainment,"" but that's where we are right now. So yes, I do hope that the movie notes that the assailant claimed not to be an Islamic terrorist but an armed robber stealing just to eat. And yes, there is meaning in images like the one that ends the trailer, with a young white woman on her knees cowering in fear while the scary brown gunman prepares to do ill. Still, if the movie works the movie works, and you'll note that I ended up mostly liking Paramount's 13 Hours (and Sony's Act of Valor for that matter). I do hope the movie breaks out when it opens on Feb. 9, 2018. For one thing, I'll be happy to write some positive Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc. box office news after a two months of picking on them over Justice League and Blade Runner 2049. Second, we're only getting a trailer for this movie seven weeks before the release date, which is really unusual in this day-and-age. As much as I like to champion movies that don't long-lead the marketing, history is not on this movie's side if you compare the performances of WB's Dark Shadows, WB's Jonah Hex, Sony's Ghostbusters and other movies that held off until nearly the last minute. The good news is that A) it's not like this movie needs tons of online movie nerd hype and B) again, it's probably so cheap that it doesn't need to go nuts to make money. Besides, if Paramount/Viacom Inc.'s 10 Cloverfield Lane can do it, so can 15:17 to Paris.

While it may seem like it takes Congress forever to get anything done, they are at least always talking about doing something. Not a session of Congress goes by where members from both major political parties propose some form of legislation related to guns. Some of these never gain any support, while others pick up momentum and eventually become law. If you’re a gun owner – or someone concerned about gun control – you’ll want to know what Congress is considering, so that you can either prepare yourself, or contact your representatives to let them know your position. If you wait until the proposals turn into laws, it becomes much harder to have them changed. Here are just a few of the recent proposals made in Congress related to guns. Strengthening the Background Check System One proposal that seems likely to progress further – thanks to support from both parties – is one that looks to strengthen the Federal background check system. A recent mass shooter in Texas was able to purchase a firearm because he slipped through the cracks of the current system. Proponents of this measure say that if the Federal background check system was stronger, instances like the mass shooting in Texas would occur less frequently. As it currently stands, you cannot purchase a firearm if you have a history of violence or mental health issues. The new measure would ensure that these provisions are more broadly enforced. While this is unlikely to fix all of the issues related to gun violence in this counter, members of Congress feel it is a step in the right direction. As long as you don’t have a criminal record or a history of violence, this law would likely not impact your ability to purchase a gun. Changing the Concealed Carry Laws The laws regarding the ability to carry a concealed weapon vary from state to state. Under a new measure going through Congress, state’s would have to allow a concealed carry license issued from another state. As it currently stands, you are not allowed to carry a concealed weapon into certain states that have provisions against it. Opponents of this bill argue that it infringes upon their State’s rights, and undermines actions they have taken to protect their citizens. On the other hand, proponents say that we should treat concealed carry licenses like other licenses, in that they are valid across all states. If you’re the owner of a concealed carry license, this proposal would impact whether or not you can bring your weapon into certain states. For others of you, it could mean the undermining of your state’s laws regarding the prohibition of concealed carry. Assault Weapons Ban Finally, another proposal made in the aftermath of several recent mass shootings is a ban on assault weapons. Congress has passed an assault weapons ban before back in 1994, but that legislation expired in 2004. This new bill would block the sale, purchase and production of military-style assault weapons. It would also ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The bill would not take away any guns currently owned, as it would only impact future sales and production. If you’re the owner of one of these weapons, you can keep it, but there would be restrictions on how you can sell or transfer the weapon going forward. In addition, you may notice some changes when it comes to bulk ammo purchases. This bill as of yet does not have bipartisan support, and remains supported by Democrats while opposed by Republicans. Only time will tell if this changes, and eventually turns into a law. Know How Gun Proposals Affect You Whether you’re a gun owner or not, the laws that Congress passes affect you. They could limit whether or not you are able to buy a gun, what type of guns you are able to purchase, whether you can purchase bulk ammo, or where you are able to bring your gun. For non gun owners, the laws impact those around you. It’s important that you keep abreast of what Congress is discussing, so that you can decide where you land on the issue, and let your Congressperson know. New gun proposals happen all the time, but if you wait until it’s law to make your voice heard, it will likely be too late. Hopefully the above summaries will help you get to know the most popular proposals made today, and going forward you’ll know what Congress is up to regarding guns.

4 Rather than providing answers to what actually happened in Las Vegas when “lone wolf” Stephen Paddock allegedly fired hundreds of shots into a festival crowd from a hotel room window above the Las Vegas Strip, officials have been evasive, fueling citizen journalists’ investigations of the events. Why are officials apparently so uneasy with details surrounding this event, and why has mainstream media stopped covering what is allegedly the largest massacre by an individual in U.S. history? By S.T. Patrick Nearly two months after the Oct. 1 mass shooting outside of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, the official explanation of what happened that evening has elicited more questions than it has provided answers. By mid-November, the increasingly rare release of news and information from Clark County and federal officials had critical alternative news outlets wondering how the deadliest mass shooting by an individual in U.S. history had disappeared from a 24/7 news cycle. When questions go unanswered, it often signals an uneasiness officials have with the questions themselves. Motivations can range from embarrassment caused by dereliction of duty on the part of employees and authorities to a fear that a true revelation of answers will cause an official narrative to crumble. In the aftermath of the shooting that killed at least 57 attendees of the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas, myriad questions remain unanswered. Within two hours of the attacks, Las Vegas authorities announced that Stephen Paddock had acted alone. Fitting the archetype of a lone gunman, Paddock, 64, a native of nearby Mesquite, Nev., was portrayed as a loner, an alcoholic, and the son of a father who was on the FBI’s Most Wanted list for a decade. Sheriff Joe Lombardo avoided defining a specific motive but did allude to Paddock’s recent loss of significant wealth. Paddock’s past remains murky in a way that has gone unexplained. He had taken several cruises that made port stops in the Middle East, yet despite ISIS claiming Paddock as their “soldier,” the FBI insisted there was “no connection with an international terrorist group.” He wired $100,000 to an account in the Philippines a week before the shootings; officials still have not disclosed the details of the transfer. According to investigators who searched his Mandalay Bay suite after the shootings, Paddock’s hard drive was suspiciously missing from his laptop.  The strange tale of security guard Jesus Campos has been an enigma from the beginning. Campos was supposedly shot in the leg at 9:59 p.m., about six minutes before Paddock reportedly first began his attack. Campos then reportedly went to UMC Quick Care for treatment, but the facility administrators stated they have “heard nothing” of Campos receiving treatment from them. Campos then left the country, thus no-showing several scheduled television interviews. When he returned he did not sit down for an interview with a hard-hitting news organization. Instead, he appeared on the entertainment talk show “Ellen DeGeneres Show,” where he would not be expected to answer any probing questions. Craig Eiland, an attorney for the victims, questioned why Paddock hadn’t been stopped before he began shooting out of the hotel room window. Eiland told Fox News two police officers were attending to Campos outside of Paddock’s door before the shooting of concert attendees began. Officials later claimed that it took them until 10:17 p.m.—18 minutes after Paddock shot Campos—to pinpoint the location of the shooter. Security experts have estimated that Mandalay Bay has over 3,000 security cameras. The Los Angeles Times referred to Las Vegas casinos as “miniature surveillance states.” Yet no footage of Paddock has been released to the public. Officials have stated that no footage of Paddock exists, as the hotel’s hallways are without cameras for logistical reasons. On Sept. 11, an anonymous poster going by the moniker “John” posted an ominous warning on the “4chan” imageboard website warning readers to stay away from large gatherings in Las Vegas. After his initial predicted date passed without incident, many labeled it a hoax. Three weeks later, many wondered who “John” was and what he really knew. He had predicted a false-flag incident that would result in a major overhaul of Las Vegas security. He also claimed that several individuals would profit from the mass killing. AFP is not naming the individuals cited by John for legal reasons, but they include a prominent former U.S. official and a billionaire. One of the most widely discussed pieces of footage from the Las Vegas shooting was the video of a young woman who described how a short, Hispanic woman and her boyfriend pushed their way to the front of the crowd. They began loudly harassing a woman until security began escorting them out of the venue. As the woman was being led out, she began shouting, “You’re all going to die!” Kymberley Suchomel, 28, was uninjured in the attack. Her Facebook post detailing the belief that there were multiple shooters on the ground soon went viral. “There was more than one gun firing. 100% more than one,” she wrote. She wanted to organize a group of witnesses who would help tell the truth and correct the official narrative. A week later, Suchomel died, reportedly of an epileptic seizure.  One theory surrounding the shootings is that the chaos at Mandalay Bay was part of a larger project that would end in an assassination at the Tropicana Hotel and Casino and a coup in Saudi Arabia. The theory is that Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, co-owner of floors 35-39 of Mandalay Bay, had planned an assassination of his cousin Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is next in line to be king of Saudi Arabia. Angry that the moderate Sunni Crown Prince Salman was named next in line for the throne by his father, King Salman, Talal, an extreme Wahhabist, allegedly ordered an attempt on the life of Salman to take place on Nov. 1 in Las Vegas. Paddock, the theory states, was a pilot who ran guns between the U.S. and the Philippines for Talal. Paddock’s wealth came from the gun running and not gambling. It was Talal who also gave Paddock access to the service elevators. The attempt on Salman’s life failed, and Paddock became Talal’s sacrificial lamb rather than his getaway pilot. Rumors of shots fired at the Tropicana persist. On Nov. 4, Salman had Talal arrested on corruption and money laundering charges.  There were additional witnesses who reported shooters on the ground, shots fired in other hotels along the Las Vegas strip, anomalies in the police radio dispatches, reports of fireworks before the shots, and amateur photographic analysts who question the contents of the official and unofficial photos that have been released. As the corps of citizen researchers continues to do the journalistic work that the mainstream media seems unwilling to execute, those following the story will continue to wonder—to paraphrase the ad campaign—what happened in Vegas.

What became of the hijacked helo on the Delano? Good luck. We will never know what really happened in Vegas that night. Just like we will never know what happened in Dallas in 1963. Our feral Gooberment lies to us to keep the sheep in line and confused for their Elite masters. We are all slaves to this “beastly” system. It controls our minds and bodies from cradle to grave. There is only one way to free us from it’s grip and none of you are willing to do what it takes. Thus you and your children and theirs will be slaves until this new Babylon gets burned to the ground. ” If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen.”

The shooting in Newtown, Conn., began around 9:30 a.m. after 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother at their home. He killed 20 children along with six adults at the school before killing himself.
Advertisement The massacre shocked the country -- it was the second-worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history and most of the victims were 6 or 7 years old. Former President Barack Obama shed tears several times as he addressed the shooting from the White House, describing the ""overwhelming grief"" felt throughout the nation.

But there are families in Connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now.""

Other gun-control measures were introduced in Congress in the years since, but none passed. The biggest gun control actions have come at the state level.
RELATED Newtown flowers used in memorial soil The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence -- founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot along with 18 others in 2011 -- said there have been more than 200 state laws put in place since the Sandy Hook shooting. Most address deal with expanding background checks and others enact regulations on ammunition purchases and reporting of lost or stolen firearms. ""In some states, people are considerably safer than they were five years ago from gun violence, but that's not true at the federal level. Overall as a nation, people are dying at far too great a rate,"" Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, told ABC News.

Others say legislation allowing more gun freedoms, like the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act passed by the House in December, help protect more Americans in similar mass shootings. The legislation is ""the culmination of a 30-year movement recognizing the right of all law-abiding Americans to defend themselves and their loved ones, including when they cross state lines,"" said Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association. There have been hundreds of mass shootings in the country since Sandy Hook, including two with higher death tolls. A shooter killed 58 people at a concert outside the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on Oct. 1 in Las Vegas, and 49 victims died in June 2016 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla.

Local houses of worship and families plan to hold private events, and schools will be open as normal. This is the first anniversary of the massacre since the new Sandy Hook elementary school opened on the grounds of the school where the shooting happened. The old school, along with the Lanza home, were demolished.

65,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/9pPsd_Ooyxo/,"Luby’s Cafeteria. Red Lake High School. Virginia Tech. Fort Hood. A Safeway in Tucson. An immigrant center in Binghamton. A mall in Omaha. A salon in Seal Beach. A movie theater in Aurora. After each mass shooting in America, I waited for someone else to act. Each time, I assumed lawmakers would rally to protect their constituents. I assumed businesses would act to protect their customers. I assumed someone would step up. After each shooting, none of those things happened. Then on December 14, 2012, I was folding laundry when the news broke on CNN that there had been a shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Reporters spoke, as images were broadcast of children being marched in a line into the woods outside the school for their safety, of distraught families flooding parking lots, of first responders rushing into an elementary school. As I stood next to a pile of unfolded clothes, I said out loud, “Dear God, please let this not be as bad as it seems.” But it was far worse than anyone could have imagined. Twenty first-graders and six teachers had been shot and killed in the sanctity of an American elementary school, by a man whose mother gave him access to semiautomatic firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Devastated and angry, I acted. I got online and spent an hour searching for something like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, but for gun safety. Finding nothing, I created a Facebook page. Within hours, what is now Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America had thousands of followers and women from across the country began reaching out to me about starting local chapters. I knew nothing about our nation’s gun violence crisis at the time — that more than 90 Americans are shot and killed every day, and hundreds more are injured — or the laws that enabled it, but I quickly learned that a greedy gun lobby worked hard to keep them that way. For decades, the National Rifle Association has relied on propaganda and fear to erroneously lead a vocal minority to believe their guns will be taken away. It became clear to me that the most effective way to fight that fear was with a different fear: Mothers afraid their loved ones would be taken by gun violence. We spent the first few months organizing to support the Manchin-Toomey bill that would have required a background check on private gun sales. We lost in April 2013 by just a handful of votes. Then something amazing happened: Moms Demand Action volunteers pivoted back to their own communities and statehouses and began working to stop dangerous bills and pass stronger gun laws where they lived. Since the shooting at Sandy Hook School, these volunteers have helped pass background check laws in eight states, bringing the total number of states with comprehensive laws to 19. We’ve worked with domestic violence–prevention advocates in statehouses across the country to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. Just this year, eight states passed these types of laws, and both Democratic and Republican governors have signed them. On defense, we have stopped countless bad gun lobby bills that would have endangered our communities and families. Since 2014, Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety have defeated guns on campus in 29 out of 34 states. And since 2015, Moms Demand Action and Everytown have defeated guns in K-12 schools legislation in 30 out of 31 states. But even as we’re building a movement and gaining ground on the gun lobby, we know we have to work as fast as we can to save American lives to preventable gun violence. This fall, mass shootings in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs rocked the nation. We all felt scared, angry and heartbroken that, once again, this was our reality. But when our families remain at risk, the only option is to keep going. We’re still waiting for the cathartic moment when Congress finally passes a bill strengthening our gun laws, which they have still shamefully failed to do after Sandy Hook and every horrific shooting tragedy in the years since. But what I’ve learned in the past five years is that Congress isn’t where the work begins — it’s where it ends. Moms Demand Action volunteers have spent the last five years fighting for stronger gun laws in the states by building relationships with state legislators and local businesses, and in some cases, deciding to run for office themselves. To change our nation’s gun laws, we must change Congress. We must prove that legislators can anger the gun lobby and keep their seats. We must prove that voters will hold accountable legislators who choose the gun lobby’s agenda over American lives. And we must — one person at a time — mobilize Americans to act on the issue of gun safety.

Patton was convicted in September of first-degree murder for killing 22-year-old George Korchev. He also was convicted of aggravated battery with a firearm for wounding three others. Police say the shooting followed a disagreement at a party in the 300 block of East Green Street in Champaign that led to a fight. None of the four victims were involved in the fight. Champaign County Judge Roger Webber sentenced Robbie Patton on Thursday. Assistant State's Attorney Scott Larson sought a 115-year sentence and tried to show a pattern of wrongdoing by citing an incident in which Patton, then a minor, pleaded guilty to aggravated discharge of a firearm. But defense attorney Tony Allegretti recommended 51 years, saying it wasn't a preplanned mass shooting and Patton was young. Korchev graduated from Mundelein High School in 2012 and recently had earned a degree at the College of Lake County. He was set to start a nursing job at Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville the week after the shooting. Korchev had gone to Champaign to visit a friend he had known since eighth grade. Korchev was in a group walking back to the friend's apartment when the shooting occurred. The friend and another friend were among the others who were shot. The two, in addition to Korchev's girlfriend, who was also with him at the time of the shooting, testified at Patton's trial. Patton had completed a four-month stint in a boot camp two weeks before the shooting, according to records. He was granted boot camp instead of serving an eight-year prison sentence for discharging a weapon at a Steak 'n Shake restaurant in December 2015.

Ryland Ward, 5, does not yet know that his stepmother and two sisters were among the 26 killed in the November 5 massacre at First Baptist Church, The Star-Telegram reported. The boy was shot five times in the elbow, stomach and leg and is having issues with his kidney and a shattered femur. Doctors are hopeful that he can head home in six to eight weeks, which means he’ll spend the holidays in the hospital. To help lift his spirits, he’s requested holiday cards be sent to him with photos of pets or a $1 bill inside. “You got so many nice people that are sending a card and a dollar to Ryland,” Sandy Ward, Ryland’s grandmother, told KSAT. “He does really enjoy that a lot.” Those looking to help make Ryland’s wish come true can send cards to Ryland Ward

The recruiting machine keeps rolling along. Alabama has pulled quite a few elite defenders from the DMV area in the past few years, from Jonathan Allen to Da’shawn Hand to Terrell Lewis and, more recently, Shane Lee and Chris Braswell. The month of July has been good to the University of Alabama.  After adding defensive back Antonio Kite, defensive end Jeremiah Alexander and offensive In the storied history of the Alabama Crimson Tide, there have been dozens of truly great games. Check out this list of the 30 Greatest of All-Time. A couple of years ago we published the 25 Greatest Games of the Alabama football, Nick Saban era. Nick Dunlap's historic run claimed the summer's biggest trophy on Saturday when the University of Alabama commitment won the 73rd U.S. Junior Amateur Championship at The Country Club of North Carolina. A few specific plays may have led to the Tuscaloosa juggernaut. By now we have all heard, and probably told, the story of how Nick Saban brought Lane Kiffin in to modernize his offense. Alabama football players are ready to dominate again SEC Media Days carry a variety of traditions. One is the release of the SEC’s preseason all-conference team, and there were plenty of Alabama football players on it this year. New York Jets defensive lineman Quinnen Williams was placed on the Physically Unable to Perform List on Friday afternoon, per Associated Press.  The Jets Alabama Football by any reasonable definition is rebuilding. The Alabama Crimson Tide will have just three frequent 2020 starters on offense for 2021. For every other team in college football, eight new starters on offense would signal a major problem. Alabama football received three pledges this month in athlete Antonio Kite, defensive end Jeremiah Alexander, and offensive tackle Tyler Booker, and the Crimson Tide could soon welcome another. Alabama baseball has added Hunter Morris as an assistant coach, Crimson Tide coach Brad Bohannon announced on Friday morning. Morris spent the last three seasons at UT-Martin as an assistant coach, where he worked with hitters and position players on top of assisting with recruiting. The voters have spoken.  The University of Alabama football team had a league-high 16 players, including eight first-team selections, on the preseason All-SEC teams, and was picked to repeat as league champions on Friday.  The voting was done by media members in attendance at SEC Media Days this past week. This could be good news for Alabama football SEC Media Days always bring headlines and rumors, but this year brought news from outside the conference’s main teams. For Alabama Football fans finding a juicy highlight from the last day of SEC Media Days was difficult. There were lowlights; the most prominent of them coming from new Auburn Head Coach, Bryan Harsin. Auburn quarterback Bo Nix has been on both sides of the Iron Bowl rivalry. He's experienced the thrill of leading the Tigers to a 48-45 victory as a freshman Missouri redshirt-senior offensive lineman Case Cook was highly complimentary of a pair of Alabama players at the final day of the 2021 SEC Football Media Days. With the Tokyo Olympics finally happening after being postponed in 2020, BamaCentral will look back at some of the stories our writers have done throughout Kiffin believes Saban takes out his frustration with the media on his opponents. While the legendary coach explained receiving one of the shots is a personal decision for his players, he added the vaccines are the best way to ensure his team can take the field for each scheduled game. The new rules allowing college athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness have been a game-changer. And not everyone has comprehended yet just how much of a game-changer it is. Head coach Nick Saban said that, while the sophomore QB hasn't been named the 2021 season's starter yet, his brand is turning a big profit under the NCAA's new NIL policy.

74,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/Q0hb7vy5S4A/,"Joe and Claryce Holcombe’s big Texas family always sprawled on Christmas Day – their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren spread out across the small towns near where they live. But they all came together for Christmas dinner. This year, there will be eight fewer loved ones at the dinner table. The Holcombes, age 86 and 85, lost eight family members, three generations of the Holcombe family, in a matter of minutes when a gunman opened fire at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs during Sunday services on Nov. 5. In all, 26 people were murdered. Their son Bryan, 60, is now gone; so is their daughter-in-law Karla 58; their grandson Danny, 36; their pregnant granddaughter-in-law Crystal, 36; and four great-grandchildren: Noah, 18 months, Greg Hill, 13, Emily Hill, 11, and Megan Hill, 9. Even in the face of this unspeakable tragedy, Joe Holcombe – who goes by “Papa Joe” – says there will still be joy at Christmas this year. “We probably won’t have as much Christmas as we usually do, but we’ll have plenty,” he said. “It’s something definitely worth celebrating.” He added: “Everybody always wants us to be whimpering and crying because we lost some of our family. That’s not the way we are. It happened and it hurt. But we don’t look at death as separation. We look at it as just another event in our life.” Propelled by their Christian faith, Holcombe and his wife say they find comfort in knowing their loved ones are in heaven. And they hope to be reunited there with them soon. “It won’t be long until we’ll be there with the rest of the family,” he said. “I miss my family. We don’t see them coming down the sidewalk at the front door anymore. But I won’t miss them long.” It’s difficult for Holcombe to predict how he will feel on Christmas when eight family members are absent from the day’s festivities, but he said, “I’m sure it will be hard this year, but we’ll get over that too because it won’t last long.” The Holcombes, married for more than 60 years, had no idea what had happened on Nov. 5 until a pastor from their own church in Floresville paid them a rare visit and broke the news of their family members’ deaths – one-by-one. “Bryan?” Holcombe recalled asking, about his son, who was filling in as a guest preacher that day. “He’s dead,” the pastor said. “Karla?” he asked about his daughter-in-law. “She’s dead,” the pastor replied. Ten days later, when the Holcombes had to bury their dead, they made sure to lay grandson Marc Daniel “Danny” Holcombe in the same casket as his daughter Noah. The toddler was wrapped in her father’s arms when they were both gunned down. “They were buried together and they were shot together,” Holcombe said. “It was fitting.” The horror of the Holcombes’ sudden loss moved people across the country – an estimated 3,000 showed up to mourn at a funeral service near the church on Nov. 15. The loss was unimaginable to millions of Americans, who watched news of the shooting unfold from their televisions and phoned. But, the Holcombes emerged from the tragedy with unrelenting positivity. The Holcombes leave their Christmas tree up all year, mostly because they don’t have a place to store it. The family usually gathered for dinner with friends at Bryan and his wife Karla’s house on Christmas. “The house was full, gee whiz,” Holcombe recalled. This year, Holcombe plans to stay home. He expects visitors, since “there’s always somebody coming by,” and he said he will probably take a nap. He and his wife will not be visiting the cemetery where their loved ones are buried because he said their souls are no longer with them. “There’s a dead body, but they’re not ours anymore,” he said. “We know ours are in heaven.” Joe and Claryce Holcombe recently filed a legal claim with the U.S. Air Force, saying mistakes by the military branch eventually led shooter Devin Kelley to be able to buy the weapons he used in the massacre. “I don’t hold what happened against anyone,” said Joe Holcombe. But he said the legal action needed to be taken to prevent other deaths. (The Air Force did not immediately comment on the claim.) Ahead of the holidays, the couple remembers the loved ones they lost as people who deeply loved Jesus and each other. “That’s what we all should do,” Holcombe said. “We’ll never forget them.” Contact us at letters@time.com.",2017-12-15 13:00:12,This Couple Lost 8 Family Members in the Texas Church Massacre.

I didn't have the heart to take it down,"" dad Neil Heslin says Jesse Lewis always looked forward to the holidays, his dad says, no matter the occasion. “Easter or Fourth of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, he just loved the holidays, one as much as the other,” says Neil Heslin of his son. “But what makes this holiday season, Christmas, Thanksgiving to the New Year, harder is that’s when the tragedy occurred.” It has been five years since Jesse, 6, was slaughtered with 25 others — including 19 other children — in a gunman’s rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012. The time since the massacre has been an odd thing for Heslin, at once feeling so short (“some of it seems like it was just happened yesterday”) and “so long.” “It’s been a journey. So much has happened, so much has changed in a five-year period, in my life anyway,” Heslin tells PEOPLE. “And I’ve experienced so much.” One thing that hasn’t changed is Jesse’s death. “The pain and suffering doesn’t get any better, doesn’t go away, doesn’t get any easier as time goes on,” Heslin says. “I guess it gets more distant and it’s not as raw, but it’s always an open wound. There’s always reminders of the loss.” • Watch the full episode of People Features: Remembering Sandy Hook Elementary — 5 Years Later, streaming now on PeopleTV. Go to People.com/peopletv, or download the app on your favorite streaming device. Dec. 14 is particularly painful: Heslin lost his son on that day in 2012 and, five years earlier, lost his mother on the same day. “It’s like a day you just don’t even feel like getting out of bed or you’re afraid to get out of bed, statistically it being a tragic day,” he says. While he tries “go through the motions for the holidays,” one thing Heslin will not be doing this year is putting up a Christmas tree. It’s only this year that he took down his last one — the same tree that Jesse helped him set up before the mass shooting. “I had one up for five years that Jessie and I — four years — Jessie and I set up and never got a chance to decorate. I didn’t have the heart to take it down,” Heslin says. “I didn’t have the heart to look at it, quite frankly. This past year I took itdown. “I’m not putting another Christmas tree up. I just don’t have it in me.” Jesse’s loving personality inspired his mom, Scarlett Lewis, to launch the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement to help kids with social and emotional learning. Her older son, J.T. Lewis, Jesse’s brother, was honored last year at the Teen Choice Awards for founding Newtown Helps Rwanda. “It’s been five years, unbelievably, since the tragedy … and not a day goes by, not even a minute, where J.T. and I don’t think about Jesse, and miss him,” Scarlett tells PEOPLE. “And of course, I spend almost every waking moment trying to be part of the solution that caused the tragedy in the first place.” Echoing the sorrow of her son’s father, Scarlett says Jesse’s death was “like losing a limb.” “He’s still always with me, even though it’s kind of spiritually,” she says. “But you always have that longing. Always. It’s always, every day.” The pain doesn’t dull, but they persevere. “J.T. and I try to honor Jesse’s memory together by having a lot of fun,” Scarlett says. “Jesse left a little note for J.T. It was about this big, and it was folded up, and on J.T.’s desk. And J.T. came back to the house after the tragedy, and found this little note and unfolded it, and it said, ‘Have a lot of fun.’ ” “One of the key things for me, I knew I had to accept what happened and move forward and to be able to go on day by day,” Heslin says. “And I accepted it right when it happened. I didn’t like it, I knew I couldn’t change it, but I wasn’t going to let it ruin my life or destroy my life anymore than it already has.” “It’s really important to stay busy, keep your mind active,” he says, “even though you always find yourself in the distance a lot just thinking about Jesse.” ",2017-12-15 13:50:55,It Took Years for Sandy Hook Dad to Take Down Christmas Tree Son Helped Put Up Before Massacre,,300472,http://www.people.com/people/

Dec. 15 2017, Updated 5:02 p.m. ET Scott Sargent, 33, opened fired on a group of police officers outside a Pennsylvania Walmart in 2015. While he previously denied claims that he had tried to kill the cops, this Thursday during his sentencing, he arrived sporting a new tattoo of five tombstones baring his would-be-victims’ names. While Sargent failed to kill the police officers during his vicious shooting, a judge claimed that his new ink perfectly demonstrated the monstrosity of his intensions. “We learned that he received a tattoo with five tombstones with the names of his victims that survived his attack, with a skeleton skull over the tombstones,” prosecutor Jarrett Ferentino said this Thursday, adding that in his 15 years as a prosecutor he had never seen a criminal do something so bizarre. “I thought the tattoo was deplorable. I think it's disrespectful but it speaks volumes of who he is and what his intentions were that day,” he concluded before announcing the attempted-murderer’s sentencing. This past October, Sargent was found guilty of nearly two dozen charges stemming from the shootout. The charges included attempted murder of a police officer, aggravated assault and reckless endangering, according to reports. Sargent – who refused to speak during his latest trial – now faces a minimum of 179 years in prison and a maximum of 358 years. “He failed to put them the officers in their graves… I want him to be reminded every single day those individuals are why he’s spending every day in jail,” said Ferentino. After learning of the horrific tattoo, Police Officer Brian Bouton – who was shot by Sargent but survived – said, “The rest of his life he has to look at our names on his arm and remind him that he's incarcerated and doesn't have the freedom and that he failed his mission.” Fellow Police Officer Alan Gribble – who was also shot by Sargent – called the tattoo “pathetic,” according to The Citizens’ Voice, adding that when he first heard of it, he thought it was a joke. Sargent ‘s lawyer claimed the recent death of his client’s mother is what caused him to act “recklessly” in 2015. He claimed the criminal never attempted to kill anyone. Scott Sargent will likely spend the rest of his life in jail. We pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?

77,http://people.com/crime/daughter-of-slain-sandy-hook-principal-pens-emotional-letter-to-woman-in-the-target-parking-lot/,"The daughter of the murdered Sandy Hook Elementary school principal who was killed in the shooting is searching for the Good Samaritan who helped her The daughter of slain Sandy Hook Elementary School principal penned an emotional letter to the kind stranger who helped her at a Target after she heard the news of the shooting. Tina Hassinger remembered her mother, Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, on the fifth anniversary of the mass shooting that took the lives of 26 people in Newtown, Connecticut. She also remembered the woman who helped her after she found out about the shooting. In a Facebook post shared Thursday, Hassinger wrote, “To the woman in the Target parking lot, five years later.” “It was mid-morning, maybe 10:00. My older boys were at school, and I was shopping with my younger children,” Hassinger began. “Charlie was two years old, Alyson just five months.” “We were in the dairy aisle, just about ready to check out when my phone rang. It was my sister calling to tell me there’d been a shooting at Sandy Hook, the elementary school where my mom was the principal,” she wrote. “I didn’t know yet that she had been killed.” • For more about the Sandy Hook anniversary, subscribe now to PEOPLE or pick up this week’s issue, on newsstands now. As Hassinger goes on to describe the moment she left the store leaving behind a full cart of things and with her two children, she wondered how she must have seemed to the woman who helped her. “Was I standing still, dazed? Was I frantic? I don’t remember,” Hassinger wrote. “My memory of what happened over the next several hours is patchy. Some details are vividly clear. Other parts I don’t recall at all.” She described how the woman told her to sit down and remembered telling the stranger about the shooting at her mother’s school. • Watch the full episode of People Features: Remembering Sandy Hook Elementary — 5 Years Later, streaming now on PeopleTV. Go to People.com/peopletv, or download the app on your favorite streaming device. Hassinger wrote the woman followed her home to make sure she made it back safely. “When we got to my house, I don’t think we spoke again,” she wrote. “Did I wave my thanks as you drove off? Or did you wait in your car to watch as we disappeared inside?” “I don’t remember your face. And I never asked your name. But I remember your kindness, five years later,” she continued. “I’ve recounted the story of your help and concern that day many times. I have remembered your kindness over and over again. My mom used to say, “Be nice to each other. It’s really all that matters.” I don’t know you, but our brief encounter indicates you truly embody that philosophy.” She added, “Helping a stranger in distress came naturally to you, and I am sincerely grateful for your actions. Your compassion is a bright spot in my memory of that dark day. To the woman in the Target parking lot, I want to say thank you, five years later.” Since her post, Hassinger has tweeted about the story, asking strangers to help her find the woman whose kindness has stayed with her. Hochsprung died trying to protect the students she cared for every day. The gunman, identified as 20-year-old Adam Lanza, started his rampage in the school’s main office, where Hochsprung had reportedly come out of a meeting.

81,http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2017/12/nfl_draft_2018_potential_giants_targets_to_know_on.html,"By James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Bowl season kicks off Saturday with six games. The Giants, who can use a lot of help, should be watching closely. There won't be any players worth selecting with a top-3 pick in Saturday's game, but there will be some quality wideouts and linemen in action - two areas of need for the Giants. Here's a look at some players fans should keep an eye on:  Marco Garcia | AP Photo Saturday's bowl game schedule: Celebration Bowl: Grambling State vs. North Carolina A&T, noon, ABCNew Orleans Bowl: Troy vs. North Texas, 1 p.m., ESPNCure Bowl: Western Kentucky vs. Georgia State, 2:30 p.m., CBS Sports NetworkLas Vegas Bowl: No. 25 Boise State vs. Oregon, 3:30 p.m., ABCNew Mexico Bowl: Marshall vs. Colorado State, 4:30 p.m., ESPNCamellia Bowl: Middle Tennessee State vs. Arkansas State, 8 p.m., ESPN  Scott Olmos | USA TODAY Sports RB Royce Freeman, Oregon: Freeman will not be on the field Saturday. The running back is one of the first name players this year to skip his team’s bowl game in order to begin draft preparations. Freeman is expected to participate in the Senior Bowl. Freeman will leave Oregon with the seventh-most yards in FBS history (5,621). The 6-foot, 238-pounder could be a Day 2 selection after bouncing back from a down junior year with 1,639 yards from scrimmage and 16 touchdowns this fall. ""I think he might be better than people are going to give him credit for,"" an AFC personnel man told NFL.com. ""He was hurt all of last year and [Oregon] changed up the run scheme, which kept him between the tackles. With better blocking in front of him, I'm not so sure that he's not still that same kid we saw as a sophomore.""  Rick Scuteri | AP Photo OT Tyrell Crosby, Oregon: The 6-foot-5, 320-pound tackle could be a Day 2 selection as well. Crosby will play in the Las Vegas Bowl. Crosby, a Nevada native, will wear jersey No. 58 to honor the 58 victims in October’s mass shooting in Las Vegas.  Ron Chenoy | USA TODAY Sports WR Michael Gallup, Colorado State: Gallup’s touchdowns have been cut in half from his junior season – 14 in 2016 to seven as a senior this fall – but he has hauled in almost 20 more catches this year (96 versus 74) for 1,350 yards, and could be a second-round prospect. Gallup is 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds; he has six 100-yard games and two 200-yard games this season. The @NFLDraftBible Player Spotlight Show: Brandon Parker, North Carolina A&T | https://t.co/YNtAl09nUs w/ @bigstuffparker & @RickSerritella. pic.twitter.com/nwF6dL7wor OT Brandon Parker, North Carolina A&T: Parker is 6-foot-8 and 310-pounds. You can't coach that size. He will likely be a late-round developmental prospect that draws plenty of attention in the spring. The two-time MEAC offensive lineman of the year played in football-rich North Carolina, but had no FBS scholarship offers.  Brian Losness | USA TODAY Sports WR Cedrick Wilson, Boise State: Wilson is a big receiver - 6-foot-3, 188 pounds - that has put up big numbers for the Broncos. He has 73 catches for 1,290 yards and seven touchdowns this season for Boise State. He's a potential Day 2 selection and has proven to be a big play threat - he's averaging 18.8 yards per reception in his time at Boise. That's how you start the football game! Ja'Von Rolland-Jones with the strip-sack and Caleb Caston with the TD. @AStateFB leads UL,7-0. pic.twitter.com/sQp9UMdg0p DE Ja'Von Rolland-Jones, Arkansas State: The pass rusher has 44 career sacks and needs one more to break the FBS career record held by Jonathan Peterson and Terrell Suggs. Rolland-Jones has 13 sacks and 18.5 tackles for a loss this season. James Kratch may be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JamesKratch.

86,http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/12/18/seniority-by-eizo-kobayashi-2017-coming-to-close-not-soon-enough/,"Trending: “New Year’s Day; Nothing good or bad, Just human beings.” — Masaoka Shiki (1867-1902), haiku translated from Japanese by Reginal Horace Blyth Year 2017 is finally coming to a close. For a lot of people, it can’t be soon enough. I admit. It has been exceptional. This year’s hurricane season was among the most active and destructive in Puerto Rico and Florida’s history. Countless citizens and animals died or were displaced, and properties reduced to rubble as hurricanes swept unmercifully across that part of our nation. In California, residents sat with eyes focused on television screens as they witnessed wildfires racing through Napa Valley, devouring everything and leaving ashes in their wake. No sooner had those fires subsided when new wildfires erupted in Southern California that are still raging and will likely exceed the damages done up north. And who will ever forget our nation’s most horrifying mass shooting incident in Las Vegas, when a crazed gunman holed up in an upper room of a popular casino began shooting down at a hapless crowd that was attending a music concert, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more, for whatever reason no one will ever really know. As in every year, there were also countless incidents equally newsworthy, but receiving little hype, such as the young man who early one morning noticed smoke coming from one of the neighborhood homes. Without hesitating, he ran to the house and banged on the door. Getting no response, he broke in to see if anyone was there. Hearing a faint voice coming from the back of the house, he saw an elderly woman standing frozen as she was being enveloped in smoke. Without regard for his own safety, he picked her up and carried her outside as flames began to engulf the house. And then there was the young family man who went to the aid of a couple whose car was stranded on a freeway and got them safely situated before he was struck by a vehicle being operated by a suspected drunken driver. His selfless action resulted in him losing both of his legs. And what about the thousands of firefighters who worked tirelessly and the many more who are still toiling to extinguish the fires in the southern part of the state. Nor can we overlook the countless men and women who went about assisting the victims of the Florida and Texas hurricanes and rescuing those who had climbed atop their homes to escape the rising flood waters. The individuals who have been singled out for their gallantry deserve our plaudits. For all the others who also contributed there is always someone who benefited from their service, and in my book, they are all heroes. I marvel at how our nation is ready to respond to all emergencies. Whether it’s a natural catastrophe or individual call for help, you can bet there will always be someone to lend a hand. Helen Hayes once said: “We relish news of our heroes, forgetting that we are extraordinary to someone, too.” That’s the American way. Soon we will be celebrating Christmas. Although a Christian holiday, the message applies to us all: Peace and good will to everyone. Befriending a homeless person or calling on someone unable to leave their home will do wonders, and anyone who does is my hero. Merry Christmas all!

Later, the House passed a sweeping tax overhaul backed by Trump. Rep. Tom MacArthur was the only New Jersey member of the House to vote in favor of the tax bill.
And Governor-elect Phil Murphy announced that he will nominate Assemblywoman Marlene Caride to become the state’s next banking and insurance commissioner. He had nothing to say about a fast-tracked bill that would pad pensions for some politicians, notably Camden Mayor Dana Redd.
Quote of the Day: “Well, we got some good news today — [Scott] Garrett was voted down.”– Rep. Frank LoBiondo to Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. after the House passed a tax overhaul they opposed.

Editorial: Legislators lay lame-duck egg on pensions
Whenever New Jersey’s politicians talked of pension reform, we thought they were talking about ways to improve the pension system, i.e., by making it more solvent and fair, and perhaps by asking the start’s large corps of public employees to contribute more, or even switch to a 401(k) type retirement plan going forward. We didn’t bank on a form of “pension reform” – or let’s be honest, pension padding – that includes taking care of the political class first.

Whenever New Jersey’s politicians talked of pension reform, we thought they were talking about ways to improve the pension system, i.e., by making it more solvent and fair, and perhaps by asking the start’s large corps of public employees to contribute more, or even switch to a 401(k) type retirement plan going forward. We didn’t bank on a form of “pension reform” – or let’s be honest, pension padding – that includes taking care of the political class first.

91,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/508781780/0/phoenix/nation~What-does-Flynnaposs-indictment-mean-for-Vice-President-Pence/," Corrections and clarifications: A prior version of this story misstated the status of Mike Flynn's legal case. He pleaded guilty to charges of lying to the FBI. WASHINGTON – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has a theory on why he was replaced by Mike Pence as head of Donald Trump’s presidential transition. Christie told reporters Wednesday he thinks his opposition to naming retired Army general Michael Flynn as Trump’s national security adviser was a “significant reason” for his ouster. Putting Flynn in that sensitive position was a “big mistake,” Christie says, one that the country is paying dearly for. Whether Pence himself also has to pay a legal or political price for his association with Flynn is not yet clear. Flynn, who plead guilty this month to lying to the FBI about prior contacts with Russia’s ambassador, could have evidence that Pence knew more than what he’s said. So far, Pence’s regular response to revelations about interactions between Flynn and other members of the Trump team with Russian operatives is that it’s news to him. “Don’t forget Flynn may well have highly incriminating evidence about VPOTUS Mike Pence, who claimed that Flynn misled him about (Russian Ambassador Sergey) Kislyak,” Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe tweeted after Flynn pleaded guilty. “Perhaps Pence wasn’t as clueless as he claims.” Don’t forget Flynn may well have highly incriminating evidence about VPOTUS Mike Pence, who claimed that Flynn misled him about Kislyak. Perhaps Pence wasn’t as clueless as he claims. And we know a sitting VP can be indicted and convicted. Recall Agnew. But Andy Wright, who was a lawyer for Vice President Al Gore and for President Barack Obama, said it’s too soon to tell what Flynn’s guilty plea, and other developments in the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, may mean for Pence. “I think they have raised questions that Pence will have to answer,” Wright said. “But, right now, I haven’t seen anything that suggests his legal liability, absent more information.” Pence’s office said he was not one of the top transition officials Flynn — who was the vice chairman of the transition — spoke with about his conversations with Kislyak. At the time of those conversations, which took place at the end of 2016, Pence was in Indiana with his family.  (Pence’s son got married in Indiana Dec. 28, the day Obama signed an executive order imposing sanctions on Russia and Kislyak reached out to Flynn. In his plea agreement, Flynn said he discussed, on Dec. 29, how to respond to Kislyak with a senior member of the transition team who was with other senior leaders at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. When Flynn called Kislyak back, he asked the Russians not to escalate the situation.) Pence, based on what he’s said were assurances from Flynn, asserted on CBS’s Face the Nation in January that Flynn and Kislyak did not discuss the sanctions. Because the Justice Department knew about the call from surveillance of Kislyak, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates told the White House that Flynn lied about the nature of the calls so was vulnerable to blackmail.  Flynn wasn’t dismissed until mid-February, after media reports of Yates’ warning. In Flynn’s resignation, he said he had “inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information.” More: Full text: Here is what Michael Flynn is pleading guilty to More: Trump tweet suggests he knew Flynn lied to FBI when he fired him More: House conservatives ramp up accusations of bias against Trump in Russia probe Pence has not been interviewed by Mueller. He also hasn’t talked to any of the congressional committees investigating Russia’s election interference. But Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Pence should testify before that panel. “I want answers to some of the questions that logically flow from the Flynn guilty plea, such as what did he know about Flynn’s contacts with the Russians during the transition, when he was a very key figure,” Blumenthal told CNN Tuesday. Even before Flynn’s plea agreement, Blumenthal was seeking answers from Pence. He sent Pence a letter at the end of November asking for information on the role Flynn played within the transition team on issues affecting Flynn’s lobbying clients. “It is imperative that we learn the full extent of Mr. Flynn’s hidden lobbying for special interests or foreign interests while on the transition team and in the White House, as well as any undisclosed work he did for the Russian or Turkish governments, so that we may know his legal liability,” Blumenthal wrote. Flynn had not registered as lobbyist for Turkish clients while working for them. He told the transition team in early January that the FBI was investigating his lobbying work, The New York Times previously reported. Pence has maintained he only learned about Flynn’s work for Turkey from news reports. After taking over the transition team, however, Pence was sent a letter by Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, raising questions about Flynn’s lobbying for Russia and Turkey. Cummings asked for information Flynn had shared with the transition about his work, and a signed assertion from Flynn that he did not have conflicts of interest. Pence's office declined to say Friday why Pence did not respond to Cummings’ letter. Wright, however, said that while many people are pointing to Cummings’ letter to Pence as evidence he knew about Flynn's involvement with foreign governments, it’s not clear how the transition handled incoming mail from lawmakers, and whether Pence saw it. Pence’s attorney, Wright said, should be gathering all the documents that show a chain of knowledge — from the campaign, the transition and the White House — so he’s not blindsided by anything. That includes any documentation about Pence’s role in the drafting of the letter laying out Trump’s reasons for firing James Comey as FBI director, an issue that could potentially lead to charges of obstruction of justice if Trump was trying to prevent the FBI from going after Flynn. “I’d just want to know a lot more about the tick tock of what he knew and what he didn’t,” Wright said. Loyola Law School professor Jessica Levinson said Flynn’s plea agreement “means you’re getting closer to Pence and Trump.” “But it doesn’t mean you’ll ever get there,” she added. “I don’t know what Flynn knows. I don’t know what Vice President Pence knows.” And while Pence could potentially be impeached for any revelations that come out, even if he isn’t charged with a crime, Levinson suspects the impeachment bar in the GOP-controlled Senate would be pretty high. “I don’t see a world in which they would move forward on impeachment unless it’s something that is so bad that they feel like they can’t win elections,” Levinson said. “And if I’ve learned anything in the last year, it’s that that threshold of `so bad’ is so much worse than I thought it was going to be.” Aside from any legal liability Pence could face, there’s his reputation to consider. Every time one of Pence’s statements has come back to bite him — including his assertions that Flynn didn’t discuss sanctions with Kislyak, his explanation for why Comey was fired, his dismissing as “bizarre rumors” the suggestion that there were contacts during the campaign between Russian officials and Trump associates — he faced the charge that if he was not lying, then he was an “out of the loop dupe.” “Is Mike Pence a fool or a knave?” Washington Post columnist Colbert I. King asked after Flynn’s plea agreement. Mark J. Rozell, an expert on the presidency at George Mason University, said Pence has been able to protect himself somewhat by projecting an image as a bit of an outsider in the White House. That’s a strange role for a vice president, Rozell said, “except that he’s working for Donald Trump.” While Rozell doesn’t think the investigations have seriously tainted Pence’s image, “suspicions are growing in some circles and it is not clear if he can long separate himself in the public mind from the president and the president's inner circle.” Republican operatives, however, say Pence still has a very high trustworthy quotient, despite the number of times some of his statements have been undermined. “Pence is a very careful person, and he is not someone who is going to say something and not mean it,” said Ron Bonjean, Republican partner at the public affairs shop Rokk Solutions. “So when he says that he was lied to, or his team has said that he was lied to, most Republicans, I say most people, take it as face value.” Longtime GOP strategist Danny Diaz likewise said Pence is still widely viewed as a straight shooter. “He’s someone who speaks with a high degree of credibility and consistency with regards to his views on matters,” Diaz said. “You have to measure an individual based on their record. And over many, many years, he is beyond reproach.” ",2017-12-10 13:53:08,What does Flynn&apos;s indictment mean for Vice President Pence?,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

But the real milestones of the year went beyond any single song, album, superstar ascent or legendary artist's death. From hip-hop's dominance, to Latin music's mainstream breakthrough, to the ongoing ripple effect of the #MeToo movement, many of the biggest music trends seem to represent one thing: a seismic shift in power. Artists of color in 2017 received greater respect and success. The careers of powerful men who had abused their power through sexual harassment and assault were taken down over and over again. And an American president has perhaps never faced more scrutiny from musicians than what we're seeing right now. Looking back, here are the five major developments in music that will certainly have ongoing ramifications for the future. It's been a rhetorical question for eons: Can you separate the art from the artist? Is it right to consume or champion works of art by someone known or suspected to have committed despicable, even criminal, atrocities? In 2017, we've come closer to a definitive answer than ever before: No. Throughout the year, and especially this fall in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, we've seen seemingly unsinkable careers meet a swift demise, from Bill O' Reilly to Kevin Spacey. Musicians haven't been impervious. Wisconsin-born actor and singer Tom Wopat was fired from a musical and faces criminal charges, including indecent assault and battery. Rock band PWR BTTM was poised for a major year thanks to acclaimed album ""Pageant,"" but its ascent plummeted amid sexual abuse allegations against frontman Ben Hopkins. Marilyn Manson fired his friend and longtime bassist Twiggy Ramirez following a rape accusation. Once-powerful Nashville music publicist Kirt Webster is out of work, music mogul  Russell Simmons stepped away from business ventures, and acclaimed acts like Crystal Castles and Brand New have been rocked by the #MeToo movement. But consequences have been grossly inconsistent. R. Kelly, whose career has long endured controversy, was the subject of disturbing reports of running a ""cult"" where he's reportedly isolated women and subjected them to physical and verbal abuse. But he still toured after the report and released a song called ""Juicy Booty"" with another controversial figure, Chris Brown. Rising rapper XXXTentacion faced serious charges last fall — including aggravated battery of a pregnant woman — but his first full-length album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 in August. But more stars are certain to fall amid new allegations yet to come forward, while listeners and labels are more likely to scrutinize new artists going forward. RELATED: Weinstein aftermath: All the men accused of sexual misconduct RELATED: Following indecent assault charges, Lodi native Tom Wopat's Wisconsin shows canceled RELATED: More sexual harassment accusations emerge against former Dolly Parton publicist RELATED: Chris Brown and R. Kelly's new collaboration shows how toxic men still rule music The inevitable finally happened this summer when hip-hop, combined with R&B, eclipsed rock as the most consumed genre of music in America, according to Nielsen SoundScan. You can thank the rise in streaming for this significant change; hip-hop is the most popular genre on Spotify and SoundCloud. Several rap tracks went No. 1 that wouldn't have seemed possible two years ago, from Cardi B's ""Bodak Yellow"" to Post Malone's ""Rockstar"" to Migos' ""Bad and Boujee,"" and a dozen hip-hop albums have hit No. 1 this year. LL Cool J even became the first rapper to receive a Kennedy Center honor, while the stodgy Recording Academy — criticized for awarding top prizes to white artists in recent years over acclaimed works from the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Beyonce — has nominated three hip-hop albums for the Album of the Year Grammy in 2018, with Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar leading with the most nominations. RELATED: Cardi B makes music history at top of Billboard chart RELATED: Keeping up with the Migos, rap's breakout 'Bad' boys RELATED: The 2018 Grammy nominations deservedly celebrate artists of color Hip-hop also led the wave of protest music that swelled in response to the polarizing president. No musical response garnered more attention than Eminem's scathing freestyle on the BET Hip Hop Awards, where he gave fans an ultimatum: If you're a fan of Trump, you're not a fan of mine. Political protests made their way into blockbuster arena tours with Roger Waters and Janet Jackson, while Taylor Swift received some criticism for not being political enough. And while country artists serving a conservative fan base generally skirted around political issues, there were a couple headline-seizing songs inspired by the politics of our times — Keith Urban's ""Female,"" Maren Morris' ""Dear Hate."" Outspoken political stances from Sturgill Simpson and Rosanne Cash suggest that fear of the dreaded ""Dixie Chicks"" curse, where the country group took a huge hit for protesting President George W. Bush, may someday cease to exist. Meanwhile, political music as a whole isn't going away anytime soon. RELATED: Milwaukee musicians respond to Trump presidency with protest music RELATED: With Trump-trashing spectacle, Roger Waters divides in Milwaukee, and conquers RELATED: After Eminem's Trump-trashing freestyle, hip-hop becomes leading source of protest music ""Despacito,"" Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's flirty reggaeton pop number (with an assist by Justin Bieber on the remix) wasn't your average blockbuster hit. It's the most streamed song in history — a staggering 4.4 billion views on YouTube alone — and was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 16 consecutive weeks, tying as the longest-reigning chart-topper in history. This wasn't a quirky novelty moment like the ""Macarena."" Following ""Despacito,"" 10 other primarily Spanish-language songs have cracked the Hot 100, compared with two in 2016. Superstar Beyonce, like Bieber before her, sang in Spanish, for a remix of J. Balvin's mega-hit ""Mi Gente."" Six out of 10 of the most-watched YouTube music videos this year were from Latin artists. We even saw an ambitious Latin music festival, Los Dells, launch in Wisconsin farm country. RELATED: Booking Daddy Yankee and Mana, Los Dells in Wisconsin strives to be country's largest Latin music festival RELATED: Analysis: Los Dells underperformed, but the Wisconsin Latin music festival could be a game changer RELATED: 'Despacito' changed the music industry — where does Latin music go from here? In 2015, an Eagles of Death Metal concert was the centerpiece of the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II. An Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in May was the subject of the worst terror attack in England in 12 years. And the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas in October became the site of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. It's horrifying and depressing to think that these shows, where people come together to celebrate music, could be subjected to such despicable carnage and cowardice. This year it's typically taken more time to get past security at Milwaukee concerts, and several festivals have reported an ongoing analysis of their security measures. It may seem like a nuisance, but it's necessary for these times. And come next year, and certainly further into the future, there'll almost certainly be even greater security measures to better ensure that shows stay safe.

93,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59wbd3/we-answered-americas-most-googled-questions-of-2017,"What a garbage year 2017 was. Our democracy is in shambles. New assaults on the humanity of anyone who isn’t a rich white man with quivering jowls come seemingly by the hour. We're all sad and mad and tired all the time. It’s hard to make sense of this fresh hell that is our world now. Naturally, Americans flocked to our Google overlords to try to reach some semblance of understanding. The internet monolith recently released its annual Year in Search data, and it gives some clue as to what a downer year it was. Americans were wildy Googling information on the latest natural disaster or mass shooting, cuz I guess we had a few of those this year or something?? And given the famous faces falling like rapey dominos on a daily basis, it should come as no shock that the top 10 Googled people of 2017 were all sexual predators, the women they preyed upon, or Kathy Griffin. Surprisingly, “how to gouge out your eyes and ears with a butter knife so you can no longer see or hear the news” is not one of the top trending searches for 2017. Instead the most frequently asked “how to” and “what is” queries point to an America in desperate need of relief. For instance, the most Googled “how to” question of 2017 was “how to make slime,” and not “how to survive a nuclear blast.” ""How to escape my boss’ office after he pulls out his dick and uses the secret button under his desk to lock the doors?” inexplicably didn't make the cut either. Here are the rest of the questions America asked Google most. I will answer as many as I can. I take no joy in this task. What is DACA? DACA is short for “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,” an immigration policy put into place by President Obama in 2012. It allowed undocumented immigrants who were brought into the U.S. as children to obtain a work permit and a renewable two-year “deferred action,” or stay, on any deportation proceedings. Essentially, it prevented young people from being deported back to countries they may not have been to since they were babies, and allowed them a (slightly) easier path to citizenship. On September 5, 2017, the Trump administration—via deranged Keebler elf Jeff Sessions—repealed DACA and claimed the policy encouraged lawbreaking and brought down wages for American citizens (it doesn’t, but OK). The 800,000 people currently enrolled in the program will remain under DACA protection from deportation until March 5, 2018, when, according to a White House memo, they should “prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States” unless Congress gets tired of taking stuff away from poor people and takes a stab at voting on an alternative. What is Net Neutrality? The video above gives a great rundown of all the net neutrality mess. It also helps explain another, arguably more pressing question, one that somehow didn't make Google's list: ""Why is Ajit Pai's face so goddamn punchable?"" How to buy Bitcoin? Go to Bitcoin.com and choose an exchange on their Buy Bitcoin page. Then follow the instructions and use your hard-earned dollars to purchase a fraction of one made-up internet coin, which will likely decrease in value over the next few months and leave you with nothing to show for your efforts. Make sure to tell your bank before you do this or they’ll assume some nerd stole your credit card. How to make slime? Mix together Elmer’s glue, borax, water and green food coloring in a large whiskey barrel. Climb inside, taking care to completely submerge your head. Breath in the slime and die slowly as the heavy, sticky substance fills your lungs. Repeat if necessary. What is the Paris Climate Agreement? An international pact between literally every major country on Earth—except the United States—to help combat the effects of climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emissions. What is ANTIFA? Depending on who you ask, ANTIFA is either a group of covert super-soldiers who are actively working to overthrow democracy and install Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as respective king and queen of a new communist dystopia, or a small splinter of radical leftists who are OK with punching Nazis. What is a solar eclipse? When a powerful witch is scorned, she brews a potion using the blood of a freshly-skinned calf and the sap of an ageless tree, and appeals to the moon to do her bidding. The moon, wary of falling too far under the command of the witch, tries to flee, but is thwarted in its flight by the witch’s particular friend, a burning ball of gas we humans call “the sun.” The sun blocks the moon’s path, and in the process, all light on Earth is extinguished for a few, brief minutes. When the moon has agreed to serve the witch until the end of time, the sun floats away from the moon’s shadow, bringing light back to the cold, dark planet. Or something. How to freeze your credit? If you were one of the 145.5 million Americans whose personal data was breached when hackers broke into the Equifax database this summer, you might wanna freeze your credit. This will prevent the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian) from releasing your credit report to anyone, so if someone tries to use your SSN fraudulently, they’ll be denied. The process of freezing your credit is pretty simple, if not kind of annoying. If you decide you want to do it, you can contact all three major credit bureaus online. Keep in mind it may cost $5 to $10 per freeze depending on where you live, because why SHOULDN’T you, the victim of a crime, have to pay to prevent being further victimized?? Also, every time you want to apply for a new credit card, new apartment or open a new utility account, you’ll have to manually unfreeze all three of your reports or you’ll be automatically denied. That costs money too! I DUNNO WELCOME TO LATE CAPITALISM, Y’ALL! How to cook a turkey in the oven? YOU CAN’T. What is the Antikythera mechanism? You guys, we found this fucking thing in 1902, why is this rusty Grecian crank still making headlines after 115 years? Contrary to what your crazy cousin Brian thinks, the Antikythera mechanism is not surefire proof of ancient aliens. It’s just a 2,000-year-old crank-powered astronomical calculator that could predict eclipses and chart the movement of the planets and do equations and shit. Why is it so hard for people to believe that ancient civilizations might have had a few pieces of rudimentary technology at their disposal? In the past 30 years we’ve figured out how to replicate the concept of cross-planet telepathy and put all of human knowledge into a device that fits in our hands. But sure, the idea that the Greeks might have built a calculator is pretty wild. What is covfefe? I’m going to defer to Urban Dictionary for this one: Checks out. What is a hurricane? Just one of many reasons to avoid Florida at all costs. How to make a fidget spinner? Why would you ever want to MAKE a fidget spinner??? They cost like $2. If THIS is what people have been Googling no wonder we almost elected an alleged pedophile to the senate. What a stupid year. Follow Caroline Thompson on Twitter .

94,https://patriotpost.us/articles/52968,"We pause our operations for a week in summer so our staff can recharge. We'll be back on the regular publication schedule on Monday, August 2. Five years after a psycho took the lives of 20 children and six teachers, gun grabbers still exploit them. Democrat leaders finally recognize the important role guns play in self-defense. Now that’s a headline we’ll never see. One of the main problems in the gun debate is the fact that gun control proponents always focus on the tool causing injuries or deaths, while conveniently neglecting the fact that guns save a significant number of lives in comparison. And even that misses the bigger point about constitutional rights and Liberty. In other words, there’s no real debate at all. A favorite technique of gun control advocates is to focus less on statistics and concrete evidence and more on public relations. In particular, this involves using tragedies of the past to make Americans forget all about the inconvenient data proving that guns are an effective crime deterrent. Exploiting survivors of the Pulse night club, Harvest Music Festival, Virginia Tech or Sandy Hook is designed to pull on our heartstrings and force us to think with emotion rather than with reason. This, of course, assumes that gun owners don’t care about the victims of gun violence, which is absurd and patently offensive. Although the media point to all of the above mass shootings as examples of why we need more gun control, Sandy Hook is their go-to massacre. After all, nothing tugs at the American people more than images of scared children being led across a parking lot by their teachers or weeping parents calling for Congress to take action on guns. Yesterday marked the fifth anniversary of Sandy Hook, and Democrats once again stood on the caskets of 20 children and six adults in order to remind us that “caring” about an issue is more important than our God-given right to protect ourselves from those who seek to harm us. Everyone cares about the victims of violence. But caring doesn’t solve a problem. Certainly, no amount of guns in this country will prevent a future mass shooting from taking place, but at the same time there isn’t a gun control law we can pass today that would prevent another shooting. Confiscating every gun from law-abiding citizens wouldn’t stop the majority of people who commit these horrific crimes against society. Gun sales are on the increase, but those who want to take away our ability to buy guns misinterpret the reasons. Melissa Healy writes in the Los Angeles Times, “One often-overlooked fact about mass shootings is that they have been very good for the gun business. Americans’ anxieties are stoked both by the random violence itself and the ensuing debates over gun control. Customers, including some who’ve never owned a gun, race to buy weapons they fear may be denied them down the road. And gun sales soar.” Notice how the gun grabbers never mention the real reason why gun sales spike after mass shootings: Many Americans are fully aware of what’s going on with the anti-gun and anti-Liberty agenda. They see what’s going in places like Washington, DC, and Chicago, where guns are highly regulated and it’s not safe for people to leave their homes, and they know leftists would happily make all of America suffer under the same regime. Nonetheless, millions of responsible gun owners will be blamed when the next Sandy Hook takes place. Here we are five years out, and leftists continue to use that particular massacre to push their agenda. A study published last week by the journal Science makes a direct correlation between accidental gun deaths and Sandy Hook. The authors of the study, economists Phillip Levine and Robin McKnight, noted a “27 percent increase in accidental shooting deaths overall between December 2012 and April 2013, according to data mined from the Centers for Disease Control. The rate among children spiked 64 percent, according to the study.” What’s interesting is that, according to Christen Smith, “in the paper itself, Levine and McKnight caution against interpreting their results” as a “direct link between the greater gun sales and these additional deaths.” Levine and McKnight added “we cannot determine the extent to which the impact is driven by sales or greater exposure to existing guns.” That disclaimer is the whole point. But the gun control schemers will use anything, even faulty surveys or contradictory evidence, to push their goal of chipping away at our right to keep and bear arms. Another survey being criticized by those who can’t back up their claims is the National Self Defense Survey (NSDS). The survey estimates that more than two million DGUs (Defensive Gun Uses) occur each year in the United States. Evan DiFilippis and Devin Hughes claim in a Politico article that the statistics in the National Self Defense Survey are exaggerated. One of two professors who conducted the NSDS responded in the same publication by stating the survey does not “overestimate the number of DGUs (or anything else crime-related), and at least 18 national surveys have consistently confirmed that DGUs are very common, probably more common than criminal uses of guns.” Again, gun control advocates like to cherry-pick the evidence, or distort statistics to their own advantage. Occasionally, though, an honest Democrat surfaces and admits the painful truth. Former National Public Radio CEO Ken Stern admitted that “DGUs happen all the time — 200 times a day, according to the Department of Justice, or 5,000 times a day, according to an overly exuberant Florida State University study. But whichever study you choose to believe, DGUs happen frequently and give credence to my hunting friends who see their guns as the last line of defense for themselves and their families.” In the end that’s what it’s all about. Protecting ourselves and our families from criminal individuals … and tyrannical agents of the government. Democrats and others have long manipulated data and twisted the truth in order to convince Americans that guns are the problem, while supporting policies that have created the social maladies necessitating gun ownership in the first place. All Americans want violence to end, but the Second Amendment isn’t the problem. Leftists know this, too, but they’re hoping enough Americans will fall for their charade and keep voting for political gimmicks presented as real solutions. No system of government will ever figure out how to perfect human nature. Our Founding Fathers understood this, and they gave us a Constitution to serve as a bulwark against those who don’t.

97,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/dec/21/s-c-s-capital-bans-gun-bump-stocks-2017/,"COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Citing the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas, South Carolina's capital city approved a ban on ""bump stock"" devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to mimic fully automatic guns. The measure was approved by the Columbia City Council on Tuesday night. Mayor Steve Benjamin has said he thinks the city of 134,000 people is the first to ban bump stocks. ""I believe in responsible gun ownership, and I believe in common sense,"" Benjamin said in a statement. ""That's why we've decided to do what our federal and state governments are either unable or unwilling to do."" The ordinance makes it a misdemeanor to use bump stocks or a separate device called a ""trigger crank,"" both of which can be attached to guns to increase their rate of fire. A person could legally possess a bump stock if it's not connected to a gun and stored in a separate case. Officials with the National League of Cities were not aware of any other cities that have banned bump stocks. Spokesman Tom Martin noted in an email Monday that many cities are prevented from passing ordinances that go beyond state law. South Carolina does not regulate bump stocks. There are statewide bans on bump stocks in Massachusetts and California. The Columbia ordinance lays out an argument that it fits with a South Carolina law that prohibits local governments from regulating guns or their parts. The city's ban states that bump stocks and trigger cranks do not fall within the definition of a gun or component because a gun can operate when bump stocks are removed. The state's highest court has previously invalidated a local ordinance that went beyond state law. In 2010, the South Carolina Supreme Court struck down a Myrtle Beach ordinance that required motorcycle riders to wear helmets, with justices ruling the city could not require protective gear in the absence of a state law. Authorities say the gunman who opened fire on a Las Vegas music festival in October, killing or wounding nearly 600 people, had equipped a number of guns with bump stocks. The device, which fits over a semiautomatic rifle stock and grip, allows the weapon to fire at a rate similar to a fully automatic weapon. The Columbia ordinance cites the Nevada shooting, saying: ""the carnage in Las Vegas was accomplished due to the rapid fire capabilities of a 'bump stock' attached to the shooter's firearms.""

Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in a legal opinion that he interprets state law as allowing handgun license holder to carry their weapon into a church unless the church ""provides effective oral or written notice prohibiting the carrying of handguns on its property... as the law allows."" The policy treats churches the same as most other private entities by allowing its leadership to decide their gun policy for themselves. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican who leads the state Senate, requested the opinion in the wake of the mass shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs where Devin Patrick Kelley sprayed bullets across the outside of the church before entering the building and shooting congregants, many of whom huddled under pews for protection. Kelley killed 26 people and injured another 20 before a neighbor intervened, leading the gunman into a shootout that ended in a high-speed car chase. Authorities said Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and that the shooting spree stemmed from a domestic dispute. Paxton, a Republican, suggested after the shooting that churchgoers should consider bringing their guns to church to protect themselves from such attacks. The issue reignited gun debates across the country. Democrats are pushing for greater gun control while U.S. John Cornyn has pushed for a stronger background check system. Paxton also said in his opinion Thursday that churches are exempt from private security fees charged to private institutions in the state. That fee is normally $400 the first year and costs $225 annually. Andrea Zelinski covers politics and the courts for the Chronicle. Follow her on Twitter and Facebook.

102,https://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/21/say-goodbye-to-cruising-colorado-boulevard-before-the-rose-parade-this-year/,"Trending: Campers set up along the Rose Parade‘s route on New Year’s Eve won’t see a late night stream of hot rods, muscle cars and low riders cruising by this year because the city plans to close off Colorado Boulevard earlier than ever before. The Pasadena Police Department will shut down roads along the parade route starting at 10 p.m. Dec. 31, with all of the closures finished within the hour. Impromptu, pre-parade cruising is a tradition and added excitement to the long wait for the people sitting out in the cold. Everything from Model Ts to flame-covered street racers could be seen circling the 5 1/2-mile route throughout the night. Colorado Boulevard typically closed in the early mornings on New Year’s Day. Pasadena police Chief Phillip Sanchez said officials decided to close the route off roughly six hours earlier to prevent the possibility of someone using a vehicle as a weapon. Campers are allowed to move their belongings into the street, as long as they stay behind the blue line, starting at 10 p.m., the same time the roads will close. “If we’re allowing people to step into the road, it just makes sense to close the road,” Sanchez said. Sanchez pointed to incidents around the world of trucks and other vehicles plowing into crowds, including the attack in Melbourne this week in which 14 were injured, as reason for the earlier closures. The Police Department and its federal partners adapt their strategy for the country’s largest New Year’s Day parade in response to incidents throughout the world. This year, they studied the mass shooting in Las Vegas “extensively” and have taken extra steps for the parade, he said. “I won’t go into specifics, but the Pasadena Police Department is well prepared for those threats,” Sanchez said. Still, he stressed that there are no known threats to the parade and his department continues to work with the Department of Homeland Security, the Secret Service and other federal agencies to monitor for anything that could put the parade at risk. The Rose Parade received a “Special Event Assessment Rating” in 2015 that puts security on the same level as the Super Bowl in terms of federal resources. The police presence at the Rose Parade increases every year, and 2018 will be no different. Sanchez said there will be more officers, operating overtly and covertly, than ever before. Visitors should expect to see armed police officers and Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies patrolling the streets, as well as bomb-sniffing dogs. Cameras have covered the entire route since 2015. Sanchez said it’s important for those attending the parade to notify police if they see something suspicious. Anyone going to the game should remember the Rose Bowl has a strict clear bag policy and to arrive early because of the delays caused by the increased security. On New Year’s Eve, campers can secure their spots along the route, starting at 12 p.m. Fire Chief Bertral Washington said campers should prepare for temperatures in the low 40s by bringing extra layers, blankets and other ways to stay warm. The parade itself is expected to have sunny skies and temperatures in the 70s, so bring sunglasses and hats, he said. The city recommends visitors verify that street vendors have a proper license before purchasing any food along the route. Get the latest news delivered daily!

After the mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas earlier this year, numerous hotels around the world have been looking into making security better and Disney will be no different. Beginning with three of its oldest resorts, Disney will no longer provide ""Do Not Disturb"" signs for its guests. Some may look at that and wonder just how much of an added security measure that is, but there is much more to it. According to a report from WDW Today, guests at the three monorail resorts will no longer receive ""Do Not Disturb"" signs for their rooms. They are being replaced with signs reading ""Room Occupied"" to let the hotel staff know that guests are currently in their rooms and wish to not be disturbed. Each day, though, a cast member from Disney will enter the room to check on the well-being of the guests and make sure everything is alright. Housekeeping staff will give notice that they are entering the room by knocking on the door and announcing, but this will happen for every single room at least once per day.  This will be done even for rooms of those who have chosen to forgo housekeeping during their stay at Walt Disney World. It is even stated in the information provided to guests that Disney has this right and that there are numerous reasons why this could happen.""...the hotel and its staff reserve the right to enter your room for any purposes including, but not limited to, performing maintenance and repairs or checking on the safety and security of guests and property.""For the time being, this change with the ""Do Not Disturb"" signs is going to begin at three resorts:Disney's Contemporary ResortDisney's Polynesian Village ResortDisney's Grand Floridian Resort & SpaGuests currently staying at these resorts began finding information regarding these changes in their rooms. Over the course of the remainder of 2017 and into early 2018, these changes will go into place at all other Walt Disney World Resort hotels. While Disney has not given any official reasoning for this change, it is speculated to be in the mind of guest safety considering what happened this year in Las Vegas. The mass shooting took place from a hotel which had a high vantage point and provided clear sight of people below, which is similar to the design of the monorail resorts. Walt Disney World is always looking for ways to keep its guests entertained, enjoying their vacation, and also as safe as humanly possible. Numerous changes have been made over the years with some coming about due to situations that took place or just out of realizing it is for the better of everyone. The removal of ""Do Not Disturb"" signs and new security measures will roll out property-wide in the coming weeks and guests need to be aware.",2017-12-22 13:24:43,Walt Disney World Resort Hotels Adding New Security Measures &#8211; Removing &#8216;Do Not Disturb&#8217; Signs,,26924,http://www.inquisitr.com
108,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/23/las-vegas-shooting-survivors-counseling-holidays,"The Vegas Strong Resiliency Center offers counseling to those who experienced the attack, including police, at a time of year when losses feel particularly acute Last modified on Wed 20 Feb 2019 16.08 GMT A survivor of the Las Vegas mass shooting went Christmas shopping recently, hoping to forget – if just briefly – the night when bullets rained down on an outdoor concert, killing 58 in the crowd and injuring scores, including one who died next to her. Shopping for presents made her feel worse, though.  “She felt guilty for pretending that everything was normal when it really wasn’t,” said Amy Ream, a counselor at the Vegas Strong Resiliency Center, which provides therapy and other services for people affected by the 1 October attack. “It’s survivor’s guilt: ‘How could I be celebrating when this person’s family is not?’” Las Vegas therapists are seeing a surge in new clients this season; many attendees and staff of the Route 91 country music festival, casino workers, first responders, and people who lost loved ones that night are seeking help for the first time. Coming nine weeks after the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, Christmas is coinciding for many of them with symptoms of pent-up trauma such as flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety and intense emotions. The festive holiday mood is also making many survivors feel out of sync. “Some people feel lost, because they want to be there for the rest of their family yet are suffering inside,” said Ream. “I have some clients who don’t want to celebrate the holidays, period. They just want to forget this year.” The Vegas Strong Resiliency Center is decorated with handmade cards sent by San Bernardino and Orlando shooting survivors – messages like “We are with you Las Vegas” – as well as photos of candlelight vigils. A Clark County government initiative, the center holds group therapy sessions and provides tips on social media for coping with the holidays. To prepare for this season, national mental health organizations offered Las Vegas counselors free training in the nuances of trauma therapy. “We all knew the initial reaction was great, but we had to be prepared to support all these people that were going to come in in December, January and February,” said Dan Ficalora, of Bridge Counseling Associates. “Trauma takes one to two months to settle in and you have to handle these clients in a way that’s not hurtful, detaching the negative emotion from the experience so you can talk about it. This takes knowledge of how to de-escalate and train the client in relaxation.” He recommends that people with post-traumatic stress remember that they’re safe now, that it’s OK to talk about what happened, and that getting through social outings 15 minutes at a time is an adequate goal. Avoiding the Las Vegas strip on New Year’s Eve, where fireworks will pop overhead, is also advised. But for people who have lost someone, it’s holiday traditions that are painful, and Ficalora suggests that they plan something new that both respects the past and looks forward. That may be an act of homage to the person they lost; leaving an empty seat at the table can be cathartic, he said. Going out to do charity work or taking a trip are other possibilities. Once the holidays are over, he and other Las Vegas counselors expect a spike in need regarding substance abuse. First responders, in particular, have been asked to look out for each other. “In the past they’ve turned a blind eye to knocking back a couple extra beers,” said Las Vegas police chaplain Russ Goodrum. “Now they’re trying to bring pressure to care about one another’s struggles.” The thought that at any given moment another act of violence could occur – and the fear that it’s impossible to protect yourself – was causing even cops to feel unsafe, Goodrum said. “These [attacks] keep rolling, whether it’s in America or Europe or other places, and now that they’re using trucks and weapons of various kinds, looking for crowds and people en masse, there really isn’t a place where you can relax.” There was also a sense among some in law enforcement, he said, that they had failed their neighbors. “The vest will protect you from bullets,” Goodrum tells them, “but it’s the negative energy, it’s the fear, it’s the hostility, it’s the pent-up anger, it’s a lot of that out there that can bring you down. “We’re trying to make ourselves available to them for support and to remind them that it’s a lifelong process of protecting themselves, their relationships, their mental processes.” Some Route 91 shooting survivors have organized gatherings or charity events among themselves to counter these effects. “Finding that sense of belonging, and a sphere of influence to have an impact on after a trauma, can be really empowering to your recovery,” Ficalora said. “Las Vegas gets flak both externally and internally that there’s no community here,” he added. “But if anything, what happened in October showed that there really is a deep core of community here … Sometimes it takes a very terrible event to brush off the dust and show that that’s there.”",2017-12-23 04:00:18,'They just want to forget': Las Vegas survivors brace for holiday season,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Merriam-Webster, the venerable dictionary with the sassy Twitter feed, saw searches for certain words spike alongside major news events, thanks in part to a dizzying year of political scandals, tweets, gaffes and feuds. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, along with newsmakers like Anthony Scaramucci, among others, drove users to the dictionary's website en masse to look up words they knew or thought they knew — as well as the totally made-up. NBC News spoke with lexicographer and Merriam-Webster editor-at-large Peter Sokolowski to round up only the best words made famous in 2017. Trump painted a dark picture of the country in his inaugural address. ""This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,"" he declared, a turn of phrase that raised eyebrows in the Beltway and beyond. Searches for ""carnage"" on Merriam-Webster.com surged a staggering 21,540 percent. ""A word like carnage would not draw our attention,"" Sokolowski said. ""The point being here is when a prominent person like a newsmaker, such as the president of the United States, uses language in a very particular way it suddenly seems more specific or slightly more real to a lot of people, so it drove a lot of traffic and people went to the dictionary."" The terror in Las Vegas is the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. historyAn early look at Tuesday's front: https://t.co/H6NFWNWuGQ pic.twitter.com/hE39T2fRdW The word also made a comeback later in the year when the New York Daily News used it to criticize the political inaction after the mass shooting in Las Vegas in October. A month into Trump’s presidency, The Washington Post revealed its new slogan: “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” On cue, Twitter erupted to mock the motto. excited to announce our new HuffPost slogan: The Night is Dark and Full of Terrors But others seem to have been inspired. The furor caused a large spike in searches for the word ""democracy."" ""Because these are words that describe ideas, they require a lot of definition and thought,"" Sokolowski said. ""Feminism"" was Merriam-Webster's word of the year, and we have White House adviser Kellyanne Conway partly to thank. According to Sokolowski, searches of the word spiked during key events times during the year, like the Women's March on Washington, but when Conway said in February that it was ""difficult for me to call myself a feminist in the classic sense,"" it caused another surge. With Conway using the phrase ""in the classic sense,"" it put the definition of ""feminism"" in question and the word itself became the news, he said. Overall, look-ups for ""feminism"" increased 70 percent in 2017 over 2016, according to Merriam-Webster. This word first spiked in January after Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator and a top adviser to Trump's campaign, announced he would recuse himself from any Justice Department investigation into Hillary Clinton. But according to Merriam-Webster, look-ups surged 56,550 percent in March when Sessions recused himself from the FBI's investigation into the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, which includes whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Sessions insisted that he had no improper contacts with the Russians, but nevertheless stepped aside from the probe because of his involvement in the Trump campaign. Ivanka Trump, who serves as a top-level adviser in her father's administration, told CBS News in April that she didn't ""know what it means to be complicit"" in response to a question about her silence on the president's hard-line conservative approach to issues like immigration, LGBT rights, Planned Parenthood and climate change. ""This is an invitation to the dictionary; it was very clear that she didn’t know what the word means,"" Sokolowski said. ""The word itself was the story."" While Merriam-Webster saw a 1,200 percent spike in look-ups, ""complicit"" was Dictionary.com's Word of the Year. ""Saturday Night Live,"" meanwhile, took aim at the first daughter with a perfume commercial parody. Steve Bannon, the ousted White House chief strategist who sees himself as the torchbearer of the political movement that elected Trump president, has been called many things. But it was an April editorial in The New York Times calling him a ""Svengali"" that caused the word to jump to the top spot in look-ups, with a 2,805 percent increase, Sokolowski said. Merriam-Webster defines the word as “a person who manipulates or exerts excessive control over another"" — a term that ""probably isn’t in everybody's word bag,"" Sokolowski said, explaining the increased search traffic. Searches spiked again in August when The Washington Post reported that Bannon would be leaving the White House, billing him as Trump's ""Svengali."" Throughout the year, Trump used Twitter to tout his agenda, promote Fox News segments and blast reporting he didn't like as ""Fake News."" The prolific tweeter also had a few high-profile typos and misspellings — like unpresidented, heel and council when he meant unprecedented, heal and counsel — that drove Americans to the dictionary. Still, nothing roused the internet like ""covfefe."" In May, the president typed out the beginning of a typical lament — ""Despite the constant negative press covfefe” — and hit send around midnight. The tweet was up for hours before it was deleted, but it went on to become an international joke. Wakes up.Checks Twitter....Uh......📈 Lookups fo......Regrets checking Twitter.Goes back to bed. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who has since resigned, tried to clean up the gaffe by saying it wasn't a mistake or a misspelling, but was only understood by a close group of the president's advisers. Trump issued another tweet indicating that he was in on the joke. Who can figure out the true meaning of ""covfefe"" ???  Enjoy! Anthony Scaramucci was the White House communications director for six days, but he made a big splash entering and exiting the White House. The ex-Wall Street hedge fund manager and top Republican fundraiser, known as ""The Mooch,"" stirred a 16,721 percent increase in look-ups to the word ""Scaramouch,"" which is a stock character in an Italian comedy and also means ""a cowardly buffoon,"" according to the dictionary. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and Trump spent the summer escalating a war of words amid increased nuclear tensions between the two countries. After Trump gave a controversial speech to the United Nations in September in which he threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea and called Kim ""rocket man,"" a reference to his country's recent missile tests, Kim hit back. The North Korean strongman prompted head-scratching and a staggering number of dictionary look-ups when he called Trump a ""mentally deranged dotard."" Few people knew what it meant, and Merriam-Webster saw a 35,000 percent spike in look-ups after Kim's statement. ""Basically we're getting a vocabulary lesson for the nation as a consequence of the news,"" Sokolowski said. ""I can only assume it was an unusual translation, an obsolete translation."" ""It brought a huge amount of focus on one tiny little word,"" he added. NBC News reported in October that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was on the verge of resigning over the summer, at one point referring to the president as a “moron"" in his frustration. Thanks to the news, look-ups for the insult surged by 6,033 percent, according to Merriam-Webster. Tillerson later publicly refused to say if he had, in fact, called the president a moron. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his longtime business associate Rick Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury on 12 charges, including conspiracy against the U.S., in October as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. The news prompted massive look-ups for the words ""indictment"" (943 percent) and ""collusion"" (2,198 percent), Sokolowski said. Former President George H.W. Bush, whose son Jeb ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, did not mince words when it came to Trump in November. ""He's a blowhard,"" Bush told historian Mark K. Updegrove for his book ""The Last Republicans,"" according to CNN. The report made searches for ""blowhard"" spike more than 90,000 percent, according to Merriam-Webster. The dictionary's definition? ""Braggart"" or ""windbag."" Searches for ""surrogacy"" surged in December after news broke that Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., had asked female staffers about carrying his child. He offered one former staffer $5 million to act as a surrogate for him and his wife, according to an associate of the former staffer. Franks then announced he was leaving Congress, but not before look-ups of ""surrogacy"" rose 6,200 percent, according to Merriam-Webster. ""The important lesson of this year is, words do matter and that people are paying attention,"" Sokolowski said, ""and we know that from our data.""

111,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/25/obama-post-presidential-life-trump,"‘There is nothing more pathetic in life than a former president,’ said John Quincy Adams – but a year on, what to make of our most newly minted ex? Last modified on Wed 26 Feb 2020 17.59 GMT There’s the library. There’s the memoir. There might be a foundation. Maybe some paid speeches. Perhaps a new hobby, like oil painting. Maybe, in the case of George HW Bush, accusations of groping by eight women. The life of a former president has a few set pieces, but still plenty of room for surprise. John Quincy Adams was elected to Congress. “There is nothing more pathetic in life than a former president,” he is said to have concluded.  But what about our most newly minted “former”? In his first year as an ex-president, is Barack Obama headed the way of Jimmy Carter and a career of distinguished service, or the way of the Bushes and firm retirement? Obama’s executive afterlife so far is unique because his successor is unique, say close observers of the post-presidency. Mark Updegrove, a former director of the LBJ presidential library and the author of Second Acts: Presidential Lives and Legacies After the White House, said that Obama had demonstrated admirable reserve. “You have to give him credit for his remarkable restraint given the repudiation that he has received at the hands of Donald Trump, whose agenda seems to be based on undoing everything that Obama did and not much more,” said Updegrove. “In so doing, President Obama has observed this unwritten rule among former presidents to let their successors find their way in the office.” Justin S Vaughn, a professor of political science at Boise State University, made a similar observation. “Something that might be kind of interesting to watch is if Barack Obama’s post-presidential ambitions change as he sees his presidential legacy dissolve,” said Vaughn. “Every day it seems that President Trump manages to erase a little bit more of what Obama accomplished as president. “It seems to be personal, about Trump removing his predecessor from the history books, or the accomplishments of his predecessor from the history books. And I can’t think of another parallel to that.” Despite his restraint, Obama has spoken out when Trump has made a particularly painful stab at his legacy. Obama released a statement in June defending the Affordable Care Act, opposed withdrawal from the Paris climate deal and, most sharply, slammed Trump’s decision to repeal protections for childhood immigrant arrivals. “Let’s be clear: the action taken today isn’t required legally,” Obama wrote on Facebook in September. “It’s a political decision, and a moral question.” But Obama has given Trump noticeably wide berth, despite the palpable appetite from fans for Obama to play a continued role in their lives. Updegrove pointed out that a new $50 coffee table book by former White House photographer Pete Souza, Obama: An Intimate Portrait, is selling so fast the publisher can’t keep up. “That shows the immediate nostalgia that we have for Barack Obama, given the dramatic contrast between him and his successor,” Updegrove said. The enduring eagerness of Obama’s audience, and the power of his message, has emerged in other ways. Amid an inflammatory reaction by Trump to racist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, Obama tweeted a Nelson Mandela quote that became the most-liked tweet of all time (the window full of toddlers, at a daycare center in Washington, could not have hurt): ""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion..."" pic.twitter.com/InZ58zkoAm Obama’s Twitter presence suggests a new kind of post-White House life for former presidents, in which the public has access not only to the ribbon-cuttings and official statements but the kitesurfing vacations, too. Obama just posed for the ""I'm GREAT!"" pic you'd petty post after a breakup. pic.twitter.com/DkmjF6CgTJ Elsewhere you can see Obama wearing a Santa hat, congratulating Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and sending a very solid Valentine’s Day tweet. He also tweeted condolences after terror attacks in London, Manchester, Barcelona, and New York; after a mass shooting in Las Vegas – its own act of terror – and after natural disasters in Puerto Rico and Texas. That latter tragedy brought all five living ex-presidents together in October for a fundraiser for hurricane victims (Lady Gaga, also pictured, is not an ex-president). Nothing more beautiful than everyone putting their differences aside to help humanity in the face of catastrophe. #OneAmericaAppeal pic.twitter.com/2TPdPonvWv Certain of Obama’s post-White House activities suggest a longer trajectory. In May, the Obama foundation announced the creation of a “presidential center” on Chicago’s South Side, to accommodate a presidential library, a museum, an educational facility and the foundation itself. It will also serve as headquarters for the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance, the organization founded by Obama in 2014 to expand opportunities for boys and young men of color; and it will serve the national democratic redistricting committee, an initiative to reverse Republican gerrymandering led by former attorney general Eric Holder. Obama has attracted controversy in the last year for one of his most public post-presidential activities: fundraising. He recently collected a total of more than $1m for just three speeches to three different Wall Street firms, according to Bloomberg News. That’s on top of the reported $65m advance he and Michelle Obama received as part of a package deal for their respective memoirs. “He’s gone after an immense amount of money, between book deals and huge speaking fees – pretty much what Bill Clinton did too, just went out and just hoovered up the cash,” said Vaughn. “Which other presidents haven’t been as aggressive about.” Updegrove said Obama’s ability to raise money pointed to his post-presidential potential – he may have been the 44th US commander-in-chief, but he will always be the first African American president. “President Obama, given his enormous worldwide popularity, has an opportunity to be perhaps our most successful former president, in terms of his ability to raise money, in terms of the global reach that he has,” said Updegrove. “And we may well see that through the Obama Institute. “We clearly see ambitions for a very robust presidential library, museum, foundation and institute. What he’ll do with that remains to be seen.”",2017-12-25 08:00:20,Obama's post-presidential life: what does his second act have in store?,"politics and government,books and literature,united states politics and government,biographical information",1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

114,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/KqL6YSlztE4/,"Over the past eight months, Jimmy Kimmel has emerged as a prevalent political voice in the late-night world. It all began when Kimmel opened the May 1 episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! by recounting the birth of his son, William “Billy” Kimmel, who was born with a congenital heart defect and underwent open heart surgery at just three days old. Kimmel explained that this experience had opened his eyes to the heartbreak facing families who couldn’t afford to pay for their child’s medical care. Since then, Kimmel has become an ardent advocate for universal health care coverage. He has also used his show as a platform to speak out on other issues, including gun control and the controversies surrounding the Alabama Special Election. Here’s your comprehenensive guide to all the times Jimmy Kimmel has gotten political. Kimmel opened his first show after the April birth of his second child with wife Molly McNearney by tearfully revealing that their newborn son Billy had to have open heart surgery at just three days old due to a congenital heart defect. He then delivered an emotional plea for universal health care coverage that quickly went viral, garnering support from prominent Democratic political figures such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as a number of celebrities. “If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make,” he said. “I think that’s something that whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?” Kimmel’s next major foray into the national health care debate came amidst a September push by Senate Republicans to vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill, a proposal co-sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy that would have repealed major chunks of Obamacare had it passed. The late night host called out Sen. Cassidy for saying he would only support a bill if it ensured no child would be denied medical care because their family couldn’t afford it—a standard Cassidy had dubbed the Jimmy Kimmel Test during a May appearance on Live! “This new bill actually does pass the Jimmy Kimmel Test — but a different Jimmy Kimmel Test,” Kimmel explained. “With this one, your child with a preexisting condition will get the care he needs if and only if his father is Jimmy Kimmel. Otherwise you might be screwed.” After Sen. Cassidy brushed Kimmel’s criticism aside by saying that he was sorry Kimmel didn’t understand the bill, the Live! host fired back with a list of health organizations that were also opposed to the legislation, including the American Medical Association, American Hospital Association and American Cancer Society. “I don’t want to turn this into a Kanye-and-Taylor-Swift-type situation, but when Senator Cassidy was on my show in May, he told me that he believed that every American family regardless of income should be able to get quality health care. And I believed he was sincere. Sadly, the bill he unveiled last week with Senator Lindsey Graham indicates that he was not sincere. It is by many accounts the worst health care bill yet.” On the third night of Kimmel’s campaign against Graham-Cassidy, the late night pundit came out swinging at President Donald Trump, who had tweeted that he wouldn’t sign the “great bill” if it didn’t include coverage for pre-existing conditions. “For Donald Trump, this isn’t about the Graham-Cassidy bill. It’s about getting rid of Obamacare, which he hates, primarily because Obama’s name is on it. He likes to have his name on things,” Kimmel said. “He’d sign Qurans at the Barnes and Noble in Fallujah if it meant he could get rid of Obamacare.”  Following the Las Vegas shooting—the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history—Kimmel was brought to tears on the Live! stage discussing the tragedy that had occurred in his hometown. He dedicated that night’s opening monologue to calling for gun control, or as he refered to it, “common sense.” “What I’m talking about tonight isn’t about gun control; it’s about common sense,” Kimmel said. “Common sense says no good will ever come from allowing a person to have weapons that can take down 527 Americans at a concert. Common sense says you don’t let those who suffer from mental illness buy guns.” Leading up to the Alabama Special Election, Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore started a Twitter war with Kimmel by challenging the late night host to confront him “man-to-man” after Tony Barbieri—a comedian who has appeared on Live! under the stage name Jake Byrd—disrupted an event at an Alabama church where Moore was speaking. The feud then escalated when Kimmel not only tweeted a jab at Moore’s “Christian values” but responded to the summons on his show that night. “I happen to be a Christian too. And I will share what I learned at my church: at my church, forcing yourself on underage girls is a no-no,” he said, referencing the allegations of sexual misconduct Moore is facing from multiple women who say they were teenagers at the time. “Some even consider it to be a sin.” Kimmel’s crusade against Moore continued right up to the day of the Special Election, when he took a preemptive victory lap celebrating Moore’s defeat. “I don’t know the results yet, the polls just closed, but I do know Roy Moore shouldn’t even be in the race,” he said. “And I’m not talking about the Senate race, I mean the human race.”  Write to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.",2017-12-26 09:02:01,A Comprehensive Guide to All the Times Jimmy Kimmel Has Gotten Political,"politics and government,medicine and health,health insurance and managed care",4419,http://time.com

X OUR PICKS: Nearly three of four gun deaths in Wisconsin are suicides, many among rural, white men ages 45 and older, a new study says. The state’s proportion of firearm deaths that are suicides — 72 percent — is higher than the national average of 60 percent, according to the study by UW-Madison researchers in the Wisconsin Medical Journal. Though the state’s overall rate of deaths from guns is lower than the national average, the rate has been on the rise in recent years. Dr. John Frey, an author of the study, said the findings underscore a federal report last week showing that a surge in deaths from opioid overdoses, along with an uptick in suicides, led to the first two-year drop in life expectancy, in 2015 and 2016, since the early 1960s. “We’re doing better at cancer and heart disease, at things that medicine can address,” said Frey, a UW professor emeritus of family medicine and medical editor of the Wisconsin Medical Journal. “But the society factors that affect length of life are getting worse.” Frey and Wen-Jan Tuan, a data analyst for UW’s Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, looked at firearm deaths in the state as the nation marked the five-year anniversary this month of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. From 2000 to 2014, Wisconsin had 6,966 deaths from guns, including 5,020 from suicide, 1,723 from homicide and 223 from other causes, including accidental shootings and police shootings. Rates of suicides and homicides from firearms inched up during the second half of the period analyzed, and continued to increase in 2015 and 2016, years not covered by the study, Tuan said. The gun suicide rate was highest among men, whites, people age 45 and older and residents in the northern part of the state, which is the most rural of five regions. The rate was lowest in the southeastern region, the most urban. Suicides among older rural white men could stem from a shortage of mental health services in small towns, and reflect social isolation and displeasure about economic or social conditions, Frey said. “There’s a disintegration of community,” he said. “In many ways, suicide is an act of anger.” Doctors look for risk factors for suicide among patients, but “I think we’re doing a lousy job of that,” Frey said. Electronic medical records potentially could help doctors track a significant risk factor: people living by themselves. “But there’s no field for ‘lives alone,'” he said. The Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission assesses homicides in an attempt to curb them. The same approach could be applied to rural suicides, Frey said. “It’s kind of an epidemic that is invisible,” he said. “It has such a stigma, so people don’t talk about it.” From 2000 to 2014, southeastern Wisconsin had 1,381 gun homicides, 80 percent of the state’s total. Black men were 20 times more likely to die from homicides involving firearms than white men, with black women three times more likely than white women. Suicides among older rural white men and homicides among younger urban black men might seem like disparate problems. But they involve similar factors, including poverty, job insecurity and lack of education, Frey said. “Both of these issues have to do with factors in communities, what we call social determinants of health,” he said.

118,https://www.denverpost.com/2017/12/27/ask-amy-celebrate-the-giving-season-by-donating/,"Trending: Dear Readers: In the spirit of this “giving” season, I present my annual roundup of charitable organizations readers should consider supporting. Your donation may go further at a small local nonprofit than at a large charity. I reserve much of my own donation dollars for local organizations that give within my community of need. This year I made it a practice to also give to local organizations based in communities that were beset by natural (or human-caused) disasters. All contributions count. So do nonmonetary acts of kindness, such as shoveling a neighbor’s walk, bringing a casserole to a grieving person or simply abiding with someone in need through friendship. In researching these charities, I am reminded of how fortunate we are to live in an era where generosity and helping those in need is a core value. This is a subjective list. Your own giving should reflect your interests and values. Most (but not all) of the organizations listed below have a top (four-star) rating on Charitynavigator.org, which is an excellent source for researching a charity. Water Mission (watermission.org): Founded by an environmental engineer and his wife in South Carolina in 2001, this Christian-based charity is on the ground in Puerto Rico, installing solar-powered water systems to provide fresh running water in hundreds of rural and isolated communities destroyed by Hurricane Maria. World Central Kitchen (worldcentralkitchen.org): This relatively tiny nonprofit, started by Chef Jose Andres, hit the ground running (and cooking) in Puerto Rico five days after Hurricane Maria, and started feeding people immediately. To date, they have served well over 2 million meals to Puerto Ricans. According to the New York Times, “No other single agency — not the Red Cross, the Salvation Armynor any government entity — has fed more people freshly cooked food since the hurricane, or done it in such a nurturing way.” Music City Cares Fund (cfmt.org): This fund was established very quickly after the devastating mass shooting in Las Vegas in October, where 58 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. All donations to this fund (100 percent) go to support Las Vegasnonprofits helping shooting victims. Feeding America (feedingamerica.org) Type a ZIP code into this national organization’s search engine, and you can find a local food bank within its vast network which will gratefully receive your donation dollars. Direct Relief (Directrelief.org): This charity, which has a storied history, operates in all 50 states and 70 countries, delivering medicine, staffing medical clinics and providing medical safety nets to underserved populations. Founded in California after World War II by an immigrant who did well in America, this organization receives a stellar rating. Operations range from serving in Syria to assisting in Houston, Puerto Rico and providing support during the recent wildfires that have torn through California. International Rescue Committee (Rescue.org): Founded in 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein, the IRC delivers lifesaving care to people fleeing conflict and natural disaster. The IRC worked to resettle refugees in Europe dislocated from conflict in World War II, and their work continues in the heartbreaking crisis currently unfolding in Syria, throughout Africa and around the world. IRC helps people in crisis and continues the hard work through refugee resettlement. Polaris (Polarisproject.org): I first became aware of the work of Polaris through a family member’s advocacy. Human trafficking is modern slavery, and victims are often vulnerable people who are coerced, dislocated and then forced into slavery — often in the sex trade. Victims of trafficking are sometimes in our midst, at bus stops, motels and truck stops. Law enforcement, clerks and long-haul truckers are now being trained in ways to spot and rescue these individuals. Victims can text BeFree (233733) and be connected with an advocate. Save the Children (Savethechildren.org): When disaster strikes around the world, Save the Children is there with food, medical care and education. They help communities to rebuild through long-term recovery programs. The website has a cool gift catalogue; purchases help fund the organization’s worthy mission. Patient Services Incorporated (patientservicesinc.org): This organization was founded in 1989 by a clinical counselor who saw the devastating impact of the high costs associated with medical treatment of chronic illnesses. Their simple mission is to help people cover the high cost of health care, through offering “premium and copayment assistance.” Homes for Our Troops (Hfotusa.org): One of my favorites, this group raises money and then turns the funds into concrete action, building a new home or adapting an existing home for handicapped accessibility. The finished home is then given to a disabled veteran. All services and materials are donated.

The offseason is in full flight with the draft and free agency fast approaching. We continue our series which examines what each team needs to accomplish over the coming weeks and months. Next up is a look at Vegas. Last night as the Seattle Kraken unveiled their roster there was certainly a feeling of familiarity to when Vegas was on the clock four years ago. Sprinkled amongst the occasional household name were a group of players most common NHL fans had never heard of. The Vegas home opener is set for Oct. 12. The National Hockey League announced Wednesday night that the Seattle Kraken will kick off their inaugural season on the road against the Vegas Golden Knights. (Photo Credit: SinBin.vegas Photographer Brandon Andreasen) The New Jersey Devils and Vegas Golden Knights are opposites in every which way. They both play on different coasts, the Golden Knights are built to win right now, and the Devils are way under the cap. One day left before the big reveal! The Seattle Kraken are in the process of building out their roster as the 32nd franchise in the National Hockey League. The Expansion Draft is officially underway and boy oh boy do the Seattle Kraken have some decisions to make. From Carey Price to Vladamir Tarasenko to Mark Giordano to free agents Gabriel Landeskog and Alex Ovechkin, the number of star players available to the NHL’s newest team seems almost unbelievable. Vegas also acquires Brett Howden from the Rangers in a separate deal. So much for the Golden Knights having a quiet day leading up to the NHL’s roster freeze ahead of the expansion draft. Even though Howden is a former top prospect, a first-round pick of the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2016, his offense has not translated to the pro game. Ellis had spent his entire 10-year career in Nashville. The 30-year-old amassed 270 points (75 goals, 195 assists) in 562 games.

Just before the NHL entered a transaction freeze that lasts through Wednesday’s expansion draft, the Nashville Predators, Philadelphia Flyers, and Vegas Golden Knights completed a trade with a slew of big names.

Rosters freeze in a couple of hours, expansion lists are due slightly after that and will be released to the public tomorrow. The 22-year-old is coming off his first full season in the NHL.

City officials say as many as 350,000 tourists could show up for New Year’s weekend. There to greet them: more than 350 Nevada National Guard personnel, including 30 guardsmen at McCarran International Airport. At least 20 armed vehicles will be spread across the Strip and downtown Las Vegas, officials said. State lawmakers earlier this month nearly tripled funding to cover the security costs, the Las Vegas Sun reported. Revelers may also find police snipers surveying the Strip, authorities said, even as a musical fireworks show Sunday night explodes from the rooftops of seven Strip casinos. Many nightclubs and concert venues also have New Year’s Eve parties planned, the Sun reported, with Maroon 5, Foo Fighters, 21 Savage and others slated to appear across the region. Strollers, backpacks and glass bottles will be banned from the Strip, and minors won’t be allowed to stay in the area after 9 p.m. unless they’re with a parent or legal guardian. The Oct. 1 shooting, which took place during the last night of the annual Route 91 Harvest country music festival, left 58 people dead and 546 injured.

128,https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/less-religious-america-conservative-christians-got-president-s-ear-museum-day-court,"Jump to navigation Free Newsletters Advertisement Advertisement President Trump’s born-again-like embrace of evangelical politics was the biggest religion story of the year, but a shooting at a Texas church, a wedding cake that a Christian baker refused to make and the status of Jerusalem also grabbed headlines. And lest we forget, so did a 500-year-old schism, and a museum dedicated to a book thousands of years old. All told, it was a year in which America seemed more divided than it has been in a long time, while continuing trends of disaffiliation didn’t keep faith — in particular the conservative Christian kind — from playing an outsized role in the leadership of our nation. After decades waiting in the wings to influence American politics at the highest level, a who’s who of evangelicals, including figures such as Florida preacher Paula White and Texas pastor Robert Jeffress, showed up regularly at the White House for photo ops and policy consultations. Their ""unprecedented"" access was offered perhaps as a reward for their support, and Vice President Mike Pence was thought to have been key in arranging it. While the president's sexual history made them believers in situational ethics, on issues they cared about he followed a religious right playbook with the zeal of a convert. Apocalyptic fervor Trump appointed Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch, whom they believe will help chip away at Roe v. Wade. The president also rolled back contraceptive coverage, backed a bill to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and sought to fulfill his campaign pledge to delete the Johnson Amendment, which places limits on politicking from the pulpit. And he declared that America recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, triggering protests in the Muslim world and exciting apocalyptic fervor in America among some premillennialist Christians. Beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the religious left grew more vocal as William J. Barber II, Jim Wallis, Traci Blackmon, and other figures campaigned against the president’s policies on immigration, tax reform, and climate change. As the nation grew increasingly polarized, many pointed fingers at the role allegedly played by social media and tech giants in altering online debate. On Yom Kippur, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg atoned for the divisive role played by Facebook. And Silicon Valley teamed up with the ADL in an effort to combat hate speech. Still, haters were emboldened. In Portland, a white supremacist told a black train commuter and her hijab-wearing friend to ""go back to Saudi Arabia."" When bystanders stepped up in their defense, he stabbed them, killing two. Nationwide, assaults against Muslims surpassed the level registered after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. And a surge in anti-Semitism was also reported: Synagogues were vandalized and Jewish tombstones desecrated, though a wave of bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers turned out mostly to be the result of a hoax by an Israeli-American teenager. At a ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville — held to protest the removal of Confederate statues — a man linked to white supremacist groups rammed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19. Anti-racism protests spilled onto the football field, where Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players took a knee during the national anthem, in a religious-like gesture condemning police brutality against African-Americans. They were just doing what Jesus would have done, said Kaepernick's former San Francisco 49er teammate Eric Reid in response to criticism from the president and others. Churches targeted The nation’s plague of gun violence reached a new nadir when a man opened fire from his 32nd-floor Las Vegas hotel room, killing 58 concertgoers at a country music festival below. To maximize the bloodshed, he used a gun outfitted with a bump-stock to shoot like an automatic firearm. Churches were also targets. On Nov. 5, a man dressed in black tactical gear gunned down 25 people attending a service at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, including a pregnant woman. Her 8-month-old fetus was counted in the official death toll. It was Texas’ deadliest mass shooting and the fifth deadliest and worst in a place of worship in modern American history. And it wasn’t the only church shooting this year. On Sept. 24, a gunman fatally shot a woman at a church in Nashville and left a note describing it as retaliation for the mass shooting at an African-American church in Charleston two years ago. Churches debated how best to protect themselves from attacks. But Sutherland Springs was something other than a hate crime, as details emerged of the shooter having broken his infant stepson’s skull and beaten his wife, whose family were church members. Sexual predators Sexual harassment became a leading news topic, with scandals involving men in powerful positions preying on women and girls in vulnerable situations. It cost Hollywood director Harvey Weinstein, a major supporter of liberal causes, and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) their jobs. And it cost Alabama Republican senatorial candidate Roy Moore what should have been an easy election. Moore, a former state supreme court judge who once had a 5,280-pound granite statue of the Ten Commandments installed in the courthouse lobby, was reluctant to accept defeat and decried what he said was ""immorality"" sweeping over the land. The hashtag #metoo trended globally with thousands upon thousands of women sharing similar stories of sexual assault or harassment. In France, the Paris prosecutor’s office opened an investigation into accusations of rape by the respected Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan. Advertisement Advertisement In America, there were renewed allegations of sexual misconduct against the president, who dismissed them as – wait for it – ""fake news."" The toppling of other predatory men may have been seen as a watershed by much of the country, but many conservative white women were said to be less concerned by sexual harassment than the economy and national security. Wedding cake and ribbon-cutting Speaking of cultural shifts, two years after the Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationally, a Colorado baker asked the same tribunal for the right to conscientiously refuse to make a custom wedding cake for a gay couple. While many conservative Christians see themselves as discriminated against, surveys continued to document a generational shift in the nation’s religious makeup away from traditional Christianity, especially among the young. And a new record low was reached in the number of Americans who believe the Bible is the literal word of God. Still, the Congress that was sworn in on Jan. 3, 2017 was about as Christian as it was in the 1960s. A few blocks from the Capitol, a state-of-the-art, $500 million Museum of the Bible opened amid much prayer, ribbon-cutting and a sigh of relief by its main backer, antiquities collector Steve Green. A few months earlier, Green’s firm, crafts chain Hobby Lobby, agreed to pay a $3 million fine imposed by the Justice Department and to return thousands of illegally imported artifacts to Iraq. Muslim marriage equality Overseas, in Iraq, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory in the more-than-three-year fight against ISIS, after its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was reported killed over the summer. Christians and Yazidi refugees returning home faced an uncertain future. The future was a little brighter in neighboring Saudi Arabia for women, who will be allowed to drive starting next year. How about wearing a miniskirt? Well, that’s still out of the question, as made clear by the arrest of one woman who tried to this year and the outcry against her. In Tunisia, however, a Muslim woman can now marry out of the faith without the groom having to convert. Germany marked the 500th anniversary year of the Reformation, which was seen as cause for appreciating that, despite all the terrorism and strife in the world, at least Christians are no longer ""at war with each other.""

Buddhist and Muslims aren't getting along so well in Myanmar though. The pope brought attention to the plight of Rohingya Muslims but was criticized for not referring to them by their ethnic group's name until the next stop on his trip, Bangladesh. Into eternity In 2017, notable religious figures who died in America included gospel singer and TV star Della Reese; world religions scholar Huston Smith; Norma McCorvey, the ""Jane Roe"" of Roe v. Wade; founder of the SNAP abuse victims group Barbara Blaine; Christian apologist Nabeel Qureshi; Mormon Quorum of Apostles member Robert D. Hales; Muslim stereotype debunker Jack Shaheen, and the ""blind Sheikh,"" Omar Abdel Rahman, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Abroad, Indian Muslim leader Syed Shahabuddin, known internationally for urging a ban on Salman Rushdie’s ""Satanic Verses,"" died, as did former Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood figure Mahdi Akef, British Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, and Nigerian Imam Mohammed Bello Abubakar, who left behind 130 wives. Looking into the crystal ball What’s in store for 2018? Here are a few things to watch for: - How will religious institutions respond to the #metoo movement, with stories of abuse already making the rounds online via the #churchtoo hashtag? - The 50th anniversary of the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination on April 4 will likely be an occasion to reflect on how far the United States has come on race, and religious leaders will no doubt be prominent voices in that conversation. - Will the ban on travel from six predominantly Muslim countries — which Trump says will protect the nation from terrorists — be upheld by the Supreme Court against the challenges wending their way through lower courts? - As the ""brogrammers"" of Silicon Valley develop troubled consciences and yearnings for transcendent meaning, will any progress be made in the creation of a new religion based on Artificial Intelligence? - The canonization of martyred Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, long-stalled because of his ties to liberation theology, could take place next year and be a milestone in Pope Francis' reorienting of the Catholic Church’s priorities. - Ireland, which has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, will hold a referendum on abortion. It’s scheduled to take place weeks before the first papal visit to the country since 1978. - After the arrest of dozens of clerics this year, what will come of Crown Prince Salman’s efforts to bring Saudi Arabia’s religious establishment to heel and push for a more open brand of Islam in which their role is limited? - What will be the fate of Jared Kushner’s efforts to devise a peace plan in the Middle East after Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital? - Will the relationship between Israeli and American Jews be further strained after the Israeli government endorsed the ultra-Orthodox stance forbidding men and women to pray together at the Western Wall? - How will the Supreme Court rule in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case about the limits of free speech and religious freedom and on another case about California’s requirement that pregnancy centers post notices about publicly funded abortions?

129,https://www.denverpost.com/2017/12/27/las-vegas-new-years-eve-heightened-security/,"Trending: LAS VEGAS — An unprecedented number of law enforcement officers and National Guard members will be on duty when tens of thousands of people gather to ring in 2018 on the Las Vegas Boulevard, just three months after one of the world’s most famous roadways became associated with the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department will have every officer working Sunday, while the Nevada National Guard is activating about 350 soldiers and airmen after lawmakers earlier this month approved tripling the state funding for the event’s security measures. The federal government is also sending dozens of personnel to assist with intelligence and other efforts. “I’m confident every available resource is being used to make sure this New Year’s Eve will be safe,” Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said during a news conference Wednesday. Tourism officials expect about 330,000 to come to Las Vegas for the festivities that are anchored by a roughly eight-minute firework display at the top of seven of the destination’s casino-hotels. The show will start 10 seconds before midnight Sunday at the Stratosphere. The other firing locations are at the Venetian, Treasure Island, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Aria and MGM Grand. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security recently upgraded the city’s New Year’s Eve on its list of special events that due to its economic or social impact, length and attendance could be potential targets of criminal activity. For the first time, the celebration was ranked in the highest category, which also includes the Super Bowl. The designation of the Special Event Assessment Rating 1 leads to a substantial increase in federal resources. Lombardo said the assistance will include intelligence personnel who will analyze social media and other information, medical technicians and helicopters. The change in rating was not a direct result of the mass shooting carried out by a high-stakes gambler on Oct. 1. The man killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below. He then killed himself. Lombardo said no specific threat to the festivities has been discovered. Snipers will be posted for the first time during the event. Buses and other large vehicles will block key intersections to try to prevent anyone from plowing onto crowds. Clark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak said crews have installed nearly 800 steel posts along the Las Vegas Strip. The bollards are capable of withstanding a head-on collision from a 15,000-pound (6804-kilogram) vehicle traveling at 50 mph (80 kph). The county plans to install an additional 7,500. The number of National Guard soldiers and airmen activated in connection with Sunday’s festivities is more than double compared to last year. They will be at several locations, including McCarran International Airport. A legislative committee approved almost $357,000 to cover the cost. The control center for the show, located at the Rio All-Suites Hotel and Casino, will be staffed by officials from Clark County’s building and fire prevention department, fire department, police, Federal Aviation Administration, the fireworks company and organizers. Wind conditions are monitored. Sustained wind speeds that exceed 10 miles per hour can lead to the show’s cancellation. The expected visitation figures provided by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority shows a drop of 1.2 percent compared to last year. Visitors are expected to spend $254.3 million. More than 97 percent of the city’s nearly 149,000 hotel and motel rooms are expected to be booked.

131,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/dec/28/agencies-create-simulator-for-active-sh/,"ORLANDO, Fla. -- Using cutting-edge video game technology and animation, the U.S. Army and Homeland Security Department have developed a computer-based simulator that can train everyone from teachers to first responders on how to react to an active-shooter scenario. The training center is housed at the University of Central Florida in Orlando and offers numerous role-playing opportunities that can be used to train anyone in the world with a computer. ""With teachers, they did not self-select into a role where they expect to have bullets flying near them. Unfortunately, it's becoming a reality,"" said Tamara Griffith, a chief engineer for the project. ""We want to teach teachers how to respond as first responders."" The $5.6 million program -- known as the Enhanced Dynamic Geo-Social Environment, or EDGE -- is similar to those used by the Army to train soldiers in combat tactics and scenarios using a virtual environment. Originally designed for police and fire agencies, the civilian version is now being expanded to schools to allow teachers and other school personnel to train for active shooters alongside first responders. Homeland Security officials say the schools version should be ready for use by spring. In one simulation, the shooter rapidly fires through the front doors of an elementary school with an assault rifle and blasts his way down the hallway. Screaming children are running for their lives or frozen in fear. And teachers must quickly decide whether to barricade the doors or make a run for it with their students. Police officers arrive with guns drawn, working their way through the school. Finally they confront the shooter and end the threat. Each character in the simulation has numerous options, including someone playing the bad guy, said project manager Bob Walker. For example, each teacher has seven options on how to keep students safe, and some of the students in the program might not respond or be too afraid to react. So that becomes another problem to be solved. ""Once you hear the children, the screaming, it makes it very, very real,"" Walker said. The program can have the shooter be either an adult or a child. ""We have to worry about both children and adults being suspects,"" he said. The program's designers listened to real 911 dispatch tapes to understand the confusion and chaos that goes along with such frightening situations, Griffith said. They also talked to the mother of a child killed in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., who walked them through everything that happened that tragic day. ""It gives you chills when you think about what's happening on those tapes,"" Griffith said. ""It tore us apart to listen to her and what she went through."" But it all serves one main goal: to train educators to save lives when an armed attacker bursts through a school door. Another Enhanced Dynamic Geo-Social Environment program, which was launched in June, has an active-shooter scenario involving a 26-story hotel that includes numerous possible environments for first responder training: a conference center, a restaurant, or office spaces. As many as 60 people can train on the program at once and can be located anywhere. ""It's important that this provides agencies like fire and law enforcement an opportunity to train together,"" said Milt Nenneman, Homeland Security Science and Technology First Responder Group program manager in a recent Justice Department article. ""Very seldom do they have the opportunity to train together in real-life, and it is hard to get those agencies time away from their regular duties."" School safety advocates say safety training gets pushed to the back burner until a tragedy happens. Amanda Klinger, director of operations for nonprofit Educators School Safety Network, said this new program could help change that. ""I hope that people will sort of see this simulation as a really cool and engaging way,"" she said, ""to think about school safety.""

Although the Republicans currently hold all the cards in Washington, the year hasn’t gone as smoothly as the leadership might have wished. And it’s unlikely to get easier. A few predictions for the Republican Party in 2018: The same challenges that plagued the GOP in 2017 will overrun them in 2018. The civil war within the Republican Party that paved the way for Roy Moore to dominate the latter half of 2017’s news headlines will finally burst into full public view. The Robert Mueller-led investigation that Trump's lawyers foolishly predicted would close by the end of this year will in fact continue well into the new year. President Donald Trump will begin 2018 the way we he began 2017, with a triumphant address to a joint session of Congress. He’ll bask in the glow of successfully passing “historic” tax reform. He will then spend the better part of the year attacking members of his own party and the party leadership. A wave of retirements will sweep through the party as the increasing inevitability of a Democratic midterm wave sinks in. Those who opt to fight for re-election will be confronted with the uncomfortable choice of staying tied to Trump and the Republican base or creating distance from him and incurring their wrath. If these predictions sound dire, there’s good reason. 2017 was a year that saw the unthinkable happen all across America: White supremacists marched in Charlottesville; the worst mass shooting in history occurred at a music festival in Las Vegas; Alabama Republicans nominated an open racist for their Senate seat who turned out to be a sexual predator; and the president of the United States lead a seemingly unprecedented attack against the press and the First Amendment. But importantly, the year's seismic events have not occurred in a vacuum, and 2018 has the potential to be even more transformational. Retirements and resignations have already guaranteed that the landscape of Capitol Hill will be different in 2018 and by the end of the coming year, the entire composition of Congress could be upended. The year's seismic events have not occurred in a vacuum, and 2018 has the potential to be even more transformational. Democrats are poised to make significant, if not historic, gains in the midterm elections and could retake the majority in the House. But don't underestimate the potential for them to also take back the Senate. When 2017 began, who would have thought that the state of Alabama would elect a Democrat to the Senate. It would not surprise me if a state like Tennessee or Arizona does the same in November. Meanwhile, the threat that the Mueller investigation poses to this presidency cannot be understated. If this past year has taught us anything, it's that Mueller has the ability to completely upend the news cycle — and potentially this administration — without any warning. Moreover, as the investigation continues, so will the coordinated attacks against it from the White House and their allies at media outlets like Fox News. It almost seems inevitable that we'll reach a point where Trump will try and remove Mueller, setting up an extraordinary test of the limits of executive authority. And as all of this chaos continues to captivate and confuse voters, the Republican Party will be caught in the middle. If the GOP spends 2018 the way they spent 2017 — cowering, silent, hiding and complicit — they will be forced to retreat to their base’s most extreme positions and rhetoric. While it’s been said before, it’s worth saying again: This is a problem of the GOP’s own making. While it’s been said before, it’s worth saying again: This is a problem of the GOP’s own making. The party’s silence enabled the worst instincts of Trump and elevated the status and influence of people like Steve Bannon. Most elected Republicans in America have stood on the sidelines as Trump, Bannon and Fox News hijacked the Republican Party and used it to inflame racial tensions, challenge free press and distort the truth. With the 2018 elections bearing down on them, most Republicans may not be in the mood to challenge their new status quo and risk losing their jobs or incurring the wrath of their chief executive. It’s a gross gamble, but so far it’s paid off. Because while 2017 seems to have left many Republicans in office shaken, few seem to be feeling the consequences of their collective cowardice. So is this grace period finally ending? It’s far too early to tell, of course, but I believe that 2018 will be the year voters hold the GOP accountable for their collective cowardice. The bottom line is that the path to November will be a difficult one for the party of Lincoln, paved with conflict and turmoil.

The October massacre has led Las Vegas authorities to take implement heightened security measures, to say the least, on the famed Strip, where the Foo Fighters, Britney Spears, and Bruno Mars will perform for crowds who will see unprecedented precautions to ensure their safety. Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal that not only will the airport and Strip see snipers stationed in abundance (the city generally only employs spotters during the holiday fireworks), but 300 National Guard troops and at least 1,500 cops will patrol the most sensitive areas of the city. Further the area of the Strip near the Mandalay Bay hotel (where Paddock fired from the 32nd floor in a meticulously planned attack) will be closed. CNN also reports that intelligence gathering efforts will include social media reports, and even though Sheriff Lombardo emphasizes that there’s currently no known threat, Vegas will be on its highest alert level: Lombardo said the Homeland Security Department has elevated Las Vegas’ New Year’s Eve festivities to a Level 1 on its special-events protocols — the highest security level. The higher rating is due to a several factors, including the number of attendees and economic impact to the city, he said. Lombardo emphasized the preparations are a precaution and do not mean there are any known threats to the city. Previously, a Level 3 alert was used in Vegas for New Year’s festivities, and given that the National Guard troops who are present have been effectively doubled since past years, it’s clear that officials are leaving nothing to chance. Indeed, Clark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak told the LA Times, “Nobody puts on a New Year’s Eve show like Las Vegas, and never will it be as safe as it will be this year.” After a violence-filled year, let’s hope 2018 arrives quietly and without incident.

135,http://www.ibtimes.com/drexel-professor-george-ciccariello-maher-resigns-after-receiving-threats-over-2634531,"An outspoken Drexel University professor who received death threats after stirring controversy on Twitter over several current events including October’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, whom Fox News called ""perhaps the most consistently controversial figure in higher education this year, has resigned Thursday. George Ciccariello-Maher, an associate professor of politics and global studies, will “no longer work” at Drexel University after Dec. 31 due to continued threats of violence and death made against him, he said in a lengthy statement posted on social media Thursday. “This is not a decision I take lightly; however, after nearly a year of harassment by right-wing, white supremacist media outlets and internet mobs, after death threats and threats of violence directed against me and my family, my situation has become unsustainable,” he said in the statement. “Staying at Drexel in the eye of this storm has become detrimental to my own writing, speaking, and organizing.” In the lengthy social media post, Ciccariello-Maher went on to provide his opinion on free speech on college campuses, remarking that “we are at war, and academia is a crucial front in that war.” Ciccariello-Maher, who joined the Drexel community after having taught political theory at U.C. Berkeley, San Quentin State Prison, and the Venezuelan School of Planning in Caracas, also included messages to the faculty and his students at the university, who he said have “earned [his] admiration and the admiration of many by standing up for [their] rights.” “In the face of aggression from the racist Right and impending global catastrophe, we must defend our universities, our students, and ourselves by defending the most vulnerable among us and by making our campuses unsafe spaces for white supremacists,” he wrote in the Thursday afternoon post.  Ciccariello-Maher was placed on administrative leave since October after he made controversial comments on social media on Oct. 2, a day after 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd of music festivalgoers in Las Vegas, killing 58 people and injuring nearly 500, which prompted death threats against him. “White people and men are told that they are entitled to everything,” Ciccariello-Maher wrote Oct. 2 in a tweet. “This is what happens when they don’t get what they want.” The professor wrote in the op-ed published in the Washington Post that threats started to come in after conservative media outlets highlighted his tweets on the shooting. The university did not fire him then instead placed him on leave in order to ensure campus safety. Drexel confirmed the professor's resignation on Thursday, citing his decision “to pursue other opportunities.” “Drexel University has accepted his resignation and recognizes the significant scholarly contributions that Professor Ciccariello-Maher has made to the field of political thought and his service to the Drexel University community as an outstanding classroom teacher,” the university said in a statement. “Drexel University wishes Professor Ciccariello-Maher well in his future pursuits.” Ciccariello-Maher also came under the scanner with his comments in March that took on the U.S. military, saying it made him want to “vomit or yell” to see an airline passenger give up a first-class seat to a service member. He had first raised eyebrows and drew severe criticism when he tweeted on Christmas Eve 2016 that all he “wanted” for the holidays was a “white genocide.” He later said the tweet was a joke, explaining it as a “satirical jab at a certain paranoid racist fantasy and that white genocide does not exist.”",2017-12-29 00:01:13,Drexel Professor George Ciccariello-Maher Resigns After Receiving Threats Over Controversial Tweets,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

There’s still much to celebrate – but their inspirational vision needs an urgent update Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 18.35 GMT There’s a million things to love about Hamilton, the musical that has opened in London to reviews as glowing as those that greeted its debut on Broadway. The lyrics are so ingenious, so intricate and dexterous, that the show’s creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, has a claim to be among the most exciting writers, in any medium, in the world today. Rarely have I seen an audience delight in the tricks and rhyming pyrotechnics of language the way I saw a preview audience react to Hamilton a fortnight ago. As I say, there are countless other pleasures. The staging is inventive, the melodies memorable and, by having black and minority ethnic actors play Alexander Hamilton and his fellow founding fathers, the musical instantly offers a powerful new take on America’s tragic, enduring flaw: race. But it was the idealism of the show – which venerates Hamilton and George Washington and unabashedly romanticises the revolution that birthed the United States of America – that struck a particular chord for me.  In 2018, it will be 20 years since I published a book called Bring Home the Revolution. Begun when I was still in my 20s, it too was an essay in idealism, arguing that the American uprising of 1776 and the constitution that followed in 1787 were a rebellion against a system of government under which we Britons still laboured two centuries later – albeit with an overmighty, overcentralised government in place of the bewigged King George. The American revolution, I argued, was our inheritance, a part of our patrimony mislaid across the Atlantic. From a written constitution to a system of radically devolved power to the replacement of monarchy with an elected head of state, it was time for us to bring home the revolution that we had made in America. With impeccable timing, my hymn of praise for the US constitution appeared a matter of months before what looked a lot like a US constitutional crisis, with the impeachment of Bill Clinton over perjury charges arising from his denials of a relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. “So you want us to live the American dream?” one interviewer asked. “All a bit of nightmare now, isn’t it?” That, or something like it, has happened at intervals ever since. If it wasn’t a hideous, only-in-America mass shooting, it would be an election in which a man with fewer votes defeated an infinitely more qualified opponent who had won more. Usually, I have managed to deflect these challenges, arguing that my book was a homage to a founding ideal, not to the necessarily flawed reality. But it’s time for me to admit my doubts about its core idea – its admiration for the US constitution and system of government. For this first year of the Donald Trump presidency has exposed two flaws in the model that I cannot brush aside so easily. The first is that Trump has vividly demonstrated that much of what keeps a democracy intact is not enshrined in the written letter of a constitution, but resides instead in customs and conventions – norms – that are essential to civic wellbeing. Trump trampled all over those as a candidate – refusing to disclose his tax returns, for example – and has trampled over even more as president. Convention dictated that he had to divest himself of private business concerns on taking office, to prevent a conflict of interest – but in the absence of a law explicitly forcing him to do so, he did no such thing. The same goes for appointing unqualified relatives to senior jobs, sacking the director of the FBI with no legitimate cause, or endorsing an accused child molester for the US Senate. No law told him he couldn’t, so he did. I once thought the US constitution – a document crafted with almost mathematical precision, constructing a near-perfect equilibrium of checks and balances – offered protection against such perils. And there’s no denying that that text, as interpreted by the courts, has indeed acted as a partial roadblock in Trump’s path, delaying and diluting his Muslim-focused “travel ban”, for example. But this year of Trump has also shown the extent to which the US has an unwritten constitution that – just like ours – relies on the self-restraint of the key political players, a self-restraint usually insisted upon by a free press. Yet when confronted with a leader unbound by any sense of shame – and shamelessness might just be Trump’s defining quality – America is left unexpectedly vulnerable. Of course, there is a remedy, and its name is impeachment. Scholars are clear that Trump has already provided sufficient legal grounds for such a move – the case against him is far more compelling than the one against Bill Clinton. But impeachment proceedings are triggered by the House of Representatives, followed by a trial in the Senate, and nothing will happen so long as Republicans control both houses of Congress. In 2017 we saw with new clarity that the strength of the US constitution depends entirely on the willingness of those charged with enforcing it to do their duty. And today’s Republicans refuse to fulfil that obligation. They, like Trump, are without shame. This was a fatal oversight by Hamilton, James Madison and their fellow framers of the constitution. They did not reckon on a partisanship so intense it would blind elected representatives to the national interest – so that they would, repeatedly, put party ahead of country. The founders did not conceive of a force like today’s Republican party, willing to indulge a president nakedly hostile to ideals Americans once held sacred. My 1998 self asks me whether, say, the Westminster parliament would really be so different if confronted by a Trump-like would-be autocrat. Would individual MPs suppress their own revulsion and back him, fearing deselection by party activists if they did not – much as congressional Republicans won’t move against Trump lest they face the wrath of his base? It’s conceivable. And yet a parliamentary vote of no confidence is a lower hurdle than impeachment. Put simply, it would be easier to get rid of a British Trump. And these weaknesses in the US model have prompted me to see others. The second amendment does not compel Americans to allow an unrestricted flow of guns into the hands of the violent and dangerous, but the fact that the argument hinges on interpretations of a text written more than two centuries ago is itself a problem. It means America, in the words of that great revolutionary Thomas Paine, is too often “like dead and living bodies chained together”, today’s generation shackled to the words of their ancestors. And yet, despite everything, I still see so much to admire in the founding achievement of America. The society remains innovative, restless and creative: it’s still capable of producing a work of genius like Hamilton. But its next act of renewal might be to update or amend the text that gave it birth, to declare that no human invention, no matter how great, can remain stuck. Were he around, I suspect that “bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman” would agree.

145,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/513946818/0/milwaukee/home~Las-Vegas-security-guards-fatally-shot-in-hotelcasino/,"LAS VEGAS — Two Las Vegas security guards were fatally shot Saturday while investigating a disturbance in a room at a hotel-casino and the suspected shooter is facing critical injuries after turning the gun on himself, police said. The gunman’s motive wasn’t known but investigators believe it was an isolated incident. “I want you to know right now that this has nothing to do with terrorism,” Capt. Robert Plummer told reporters outside the scene of the shooting. The shooting happened before 7 a.m. at Arizona Charlie’s Decatur, which is located west of the Las Vegas Strip. According to police, the suspect, Christopher Olague, ran from the hotel-casino after the shooting and into a nearby neighborhood where he tried to enter two homes but the residents were able to keep him out. Police found him in a laundry room accessible through a garage of the second home after he appeared to have shot himself in the head, Lt. Dan McGrath said. According to McGrath, Olague tried to enter the first home with the intention of stealing a car and also tried to take a vehicle on the street. Police described Olague’s condition as a “non-survivable wound.” The victims’ identities were not released. Police said the uniformed security guards were a man and a woman in their 40s and that one was armed. Their identities and their causes of death will be released by Clark County Coroner’s Office. McGrath said the circumstances of what happened in the hotel room still unclear. The hotel-casino’s office did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The shooting comes a day before law enforcement officers expect tens of thousands of New Year’s Eve revelers on the Strip and three months after the city dealt with the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Officials have been trying to reassure residents and visitors that the city is safe, especially in the wake of the Oct. 1 shooting. A high-stakes gambler killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below. He then killed himself.",2017-12-30 22:46:16,2 Las Vegas security guards fatally shot in hotel-casino,,36,http://www.jsonline.com/

AP Photo/Ng Han Guan Note: This article was updated at 4 p.m. From spectacular fireworks in Hong Kong and Australia to a huge LED lightshow at the world's tallest building in Dubai, a look at how revelers around the world are ringing in 2018. Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, has again served as the focal point of New Year's Eve celebrations — though this year authorities decided against fireworks and chose a massive LED lightshow on the structure. That was in part due to safety in the city-state in the United Arab Emirates, which saw a massive skyscraper fire on New Year's Eve in 2015. The display, running down the east side of the 2,716-foot tower, showed Arabic calligraphy, geometric designs and a portrait of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE's first president. But a display of neighboring nations' flags didn't show Qatar's flag. The UAE joined Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in boycotting the tiny energy-rich nation in June over allegations Doha supports extremists and has too close ties to Iran. Qatar, which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, denies supporting extremists and shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran. Tens of thousands of Parisians and tourists were heading to the Champs-Elysees to attend a firework show at Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe monument, at the end of the famous avenue with its lines of trees sparkling with lights. Officials have warned the display might be canceled at the last minute due to a storm expected to hit France overnight. New Year's Eve celebrations were placed under high security in France, which has been hit by a series of attacks by Islamic extremists in recent years. French Interior ministry said 100,000 police officers and soldiers and 40,000 rescuers have been deployed across the country — including 2,500 on the Champs-Elysees. Bidding 2017 farewell, Pope Francis has decried wars, injustices and environmental decay which he says have ""ruined"" the year. Francis on Sunday presided at a New Year's Eve prayer service in St. Peter's Basilica, a traditional occasion to say thanks in each year's last hours. He says God gave to us a 2017 ""whole and sound,"" but that ""we humans in many ways ruined and hurt it with works of death, lies and injustices."" But, he added, ""gratitude prevails"" thanks to those ""cooperating silently for the common good."" In keeping with past practice, the pope on New Year's Day will celebrate Mass dedicated to the theme of world peace. Fireworks lit up the sky above Sydney Harbor, highlighting the city's New Year's celebrations. The massive fireworks display included a rainbow waterfall cascade of lights and color flowing off the harbor's bridge to celebrate recently passed legislation legalizing gay marriage in Australia. Over a million people were expected to gather to watch the festivities. Security was tight, but officials said there was no particular alert. Sydney officials said the event would generate some $170 million for the city and ""priceless publicity."" Nearly half the revelers were tourists. Tens of thousands of New Zealanders took to streets and beaches, becoming among the first in the world to usher in 2018. As the new year dawned in this southern hemisphere nation, fireworks boomed and crackled above city centers and harbors, and party-goers sang, hugged, danced and kissed. In Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city, tens of thousands gathered around Sky Tower as five minutes of nonstop pyrotechnics exploded from the top of the structure. But on nearby Waiheke Island, 30 kilometers (20 miles) away, authorities canceled the planned fireworks display because of drought conditions and low water supplies for firefighters. Thousands of Ugandans were gathering at churches across the country to mark the end of 2017. The raucous events, during which some preachers are known to make dubious predictions, have become such a staple of New Year's Eve festivities that the country's longtime president, Yoweri Museveni, sometimes makes time to make an appearance at a church. Still, many in this East African country prefer to celebrate at crowded beaches on the shores of Lake Victoria or in darkened halls listening to the music of pop stars who take turns offering crowd pleasers until midnight. Police warned revelers not to burn car tires in celebration, citing safety reasons, to discourage a favorite activity of those, especially in the countryside, who cannot afford real fireworks. As Russians count down the last moments before 2018 ticks over into each of the country's 11 time zones, President Vladimir Putin is calling on them to be considerate and conciliatory with each other in the new year. ""Say the most cherished words to each other, forgive mistakes and resentment, admit love, warm up with care and attention,"" Putin says in a televised message broadcast on Sunday just before midnight. ""Let the trust and mutual understanding always accompany us,"" he was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies after his statement aired in Kamchatka, the easternmost time zone. Moscow is preparing for fireworks and outdoor gatherings, despite weather that's less than festive. Usually festooned with snow at New Year's Eve, the Russian capital this year is slogging through a long spell of intermittent rain and constant gray skies. Germans will ring in 2018 under tight security from police mindful of widespread sexual abuse of women in Cologne two years ago and of a terrorist attack on a Christmas market last year. Police in Berlin added 1,600 officers on duty and said that large bags and knapsacks would not be allowed on the ""Party Mile"" leading from Brandenburg Gate, where thousands were expected to celebrate at midnight. Police in Frankfurt imposed similar restrictions in the celebration area along the Main River in the country's financial capital. Two years ago, New Year's in Cologne was marred by groping and theft committed against hundreds of women, in most cases by migrants. On Dec. 19, 2016, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri drove a stolen truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people. A major windstorm was causing problems in Scotland, but organizers expected Edinburgh's famed Hogmany New Year's Eve celebration to be unaffected. Storm Dylan is battering parts of Scotland with gusts of up to 80 miles per hour, with forecasters saying injuries are possible because of flying debris. Forecasters have not, however, put wind warnings in place for Sunday night, when the Hogmany celebrations are planned. Event organizers say the forecast for Edinburgh indicates that the celebrations will not have to be curtailed. The Edinburgh celebration is one of the most popular in Britain and regularly draws visitors from many parts of the world. Many Japanese celebrated the arrival of the Year of the Dog in the traditional way of praying for peace and good fortune at neighborhood Shinto shrines, and eating New Year's food such as noodles, shrimp and sweet black beans. Barbecued beef and octopus dumpling stalls were out at Tokyo's Zojoji Temple, where people take turns striking the giant bell 108 times at midnight, an annual practice repeated at other Buddhist temples throughout Japan. North Korea's nuclear and missile programs cast a shadow over Japan's hopes for peace, said 33-year-old cab driver Masaru Eguchi, who was ready to be busy all night shuttling shrine visitors. ""The world situation has grown so complex,"" Eguchi said, adding that he also worried about possible terrorism targeting Japan. ""I feel this very abstracted sense of uncertainty, although I really have no idea what might happen."" Security was tight in the southern Indian city of Bangalore to prevent a repeat of incidents of alleged groping and molestation of several women during last year's New Year's Eve celebrations. Sunil Kumar, the city's police commissioner, said at least 15,000 police officers were on duty and were being aided by drones and additional closed-circuit television cameras. Last year, police first denied that any sexual harassment had taken place during the celebrations in Bangalore, India's information technology hub. But later, police detained at least six men after several video clips of women being attacked by groups of men spread on social media. Hours before midnight, authorities had already reported that scores of people had been injured by celebratory firecrackers in the Philippines, which has some of the most raucous New Year's celebrations in Asia. Although the number of injuries has tapered off in recent years, largely due to hard economic times and government scare campaigns, the figures remain alarming. President Rodrigo Duterte signed an order in June confining the use of firecrackers to community-designated areas, such as near shopping malls and parks. Many Filipinos, largely influenced by Chinese tradition, believe that noisy New Year's celebrations drive away evil and misfortune. But they have carried that superstition to extremes, exploding dangerously large firecrackers and firing guns to welcome the new year despite threats of arrest. Security measures were ramped up across Turkey, which was hit by a New Year's attack a year ago that killed dozens. In Istanbul alone, 37,000 officers were on duty, with multiple streets closed to traffic and large vehicles barred from entering certain districts. Several New Year's Eve street parties were canceled for security reasons. Early on Jan. 1, 2017, an assailant shot his way into Istanbul's Reina nightclub, where hundreds were celebrating New Year's. Thirty-nine people were killed — mostly foreigners — and 79 wounded. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. On Sunday, some 100 people gathered outside the nightclub to remember the victims of the attack. Romanians prepared to usher in a new year in which the focus is expected to be an anti-corruption fight as the government seeks to push through legislation that critics say will make it harder to punish high-level graft. Television stations broadcast live from supermarkets full of last-minute shoppers, while beauty salons reported full bookings as revelers geared up for traditional celebrations of copious meals that can run to hundreds of euros (dollars). Others meditated and prayed at Orthodox churches and monasteries. In rural eastern Romania, villagers danced traditional pantomime-like jigs to welcome the new year, wrapping themselves in bear furs or dressing as horses. In his New Year message, President Klaus Iohannis praised Romanians who staged the largest protests since the end of communism. Tens of thousands of revelers will ring in the new year in Las Vegas under the close eye of law enforcement just three months after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Tourism officials expect about 330,000 people to come to Las Vegas for the festivities, which are anchored by a roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven casino-hotels. Acts including Bruno Mars, Britney Spears, Celine Dion and the Foo Fighters will keep partiers entertained before and after midnight at properties across Sin City. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department will have every officer working Sunday, while the Nevada National Guard is activating about 350 soldiers and airmen. The federal government also is sending dozens of personnel to assist with intelligence and other efforts.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  Spectacular fireworks have lit up the skies in Hong Kong, Australia and elsewhere in Asia as revelers ring in 2018. A look at how people around the world are marking the end of the year: Tens of thousands of Parisians and tourists were heading to the Champs-Elysees to attend a firework show at Napoleon’s Arc de Triomphe monument, at the end of the famous avenue with its lines of trees sparkling with lights. Officials have warned the display might be cancelled at the last minute due to a storm expected to hit France overnight. New Year’s Eve celebrations were placed under high security in France, which has been hit by a series of attacks by Islamic extremists in recent years. French Interior ministry said 100,000 police officers and soldiers and 40,000 rescuers have been deployed across the country — including 2,500 on the Champs-Elysees. ___ Bidding 2017 farewell, Pope Francis has decried wars, injustices and environmental decay which he says have “ruined” the year.Related Articles

			Probe: Officials, journalists, activists among firm’s spyware targets Francis on Sunday presided at a New Year’s Eve prayer service in St. Peter’s Basilica, a traditional occasion to say thanks in each year’s last hours. He says God gave to us a 2017 “whole and sound,” but that “we humans in many ways ruined and hurt it with works of death, lies and injustices.” But, he added, “gratitude prevails” thanks to those “cooperating silently for the common good.” In keeping with past practice, the pope on New Year’s Day will celebrate Mass dedicated to the theme of world peace. ___ Fireworks lit up the sky above Sydney Harbor, highlighting the city’s New Year’s celebrations. The massive fireworks display included a rainbow waterfall cascade of lights and color flowing off the harbor’s bridge to celebrate recently passed legislation legalizing gay marriage in Australia. Over a million people were expected to gather to watch the festivities. Security was tight, but officials said there was no particular alert. Sydney officials said the event would generate some $170 million for the city and “priceless publicity.” Nearly half the revelers were tourists. ___ Tens of thousands of New Zealanders took to streets and beaches, becoming among the first in the world to usher in 2018. As the new year dawned in this southern hemisphere nation, fireworks boomed and crackled above city centers and harbors, and party-goers sang, hugged, danced and kissed. In Auckland, New Zealand’s biggest city, tens of thousands gathered around Sky Tower as five minutes of nonstop pyrotechnics exploded from the top of the structure. But on nearby Waiheke Island, 30 kilometers (20 miles) away, authorities canceled the planned fireworks display because of drought conditions and low water supplies for firefighters. ___ Thousands of Ugandans were gathering at churches across the country to mark the end of 2017. The raucous events, during which some preachers are known to make dubious predictions, have become such a staple of New Year’s Eve festivities that the country’s longtime president, Yoweri Museveni, sometimes makes time to make an appearance at a church. Still, many in this East African country prefer to celebrate at crowded beaches on the shores of Lake Victoria or in darkened halls listening to the music of pop stars who take turns offering crowd pleasers until midnight. Police warned revelers not to burn car tires in celebration, citing safety reasons, to discourage a favorite activity of those, especially in the countryside, who cannot afford real fireworks. ___ As Russians count down the last moments before 2018 ticks over into each of the country’s 11 time zones, President Vladimir Putin is calling on them to be considerate and conciliatory with each other in the new year. “Say the most cherished words to each other, forgive mistakes and resentment, admit love, warm up with care and attention,” Putin says in a televised message broadcast on Sunday just before midnight. “Let the trust and mutual understanding always accompany us,” he was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies after his statement aired in Kamchatka, the easternmost time zone. Moscow is preparing for fireworks and outdoor gatherings, despite weather that’s less than festive. Usually festooned with snow at New Year’s Eve, the Russian capital this year is slogging through a long spell of intermittent rain and constant gray skies. ___ Germans will ring in 2018 under tight security from police mindful of widespread sexual abuse of women in Cologne two years ago and of a terrorist attack on a Christmas market last year. Police in Berlin added 1,600 officers on duty and said that large bags and knapsacks would not be allowed on the “Party Mile” leading from Brandenburg Gate, where thousands were expected to celebrate at midnight. Police in Frankfurt imposed similar restrictions in the celebration area along the Main River in the country’s financial capital. Two years ago, New Year’s in Cologne was marred by groping and theft committed against hundreds of women, in most cases by migrants. On Dec. 19, 2016, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri drove a stolen truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 19 people. ___ A major windstorm was causing problems in Scotland, but organizers expected Edinburgh’s famed Hogmany New Year’s Eve celebration to be unaffected. Storm Dylan is battering parts of Scotland with gusts of up to 80 miles per hour, with forecasters saying injuries are possible because of flying debris. Forecasters have not, however, put wind warnings in place for Sunday night, when the Hogmany celebrations are planned. Event organizers say the forecast for Edinburgh indicates that the celebrations will not have to be curtailed. The Edinburgh celebration is one of the most popular in Britain and regularly draws visitors from many parts of the world. ___ Many Japanese celebrated the arrival of the Year of the Dog in the traditional way of praying for peace and good fortune at neighborhood Shinto shrines, and eating New Year’s food such as noodles, shrimp and sweet black beans. Barbecued beef and octopus dumpling stalls were out at Tokyo’s Zojoji Temple, where people take turns striking the giant bell 108 times at midnight, an annual practice repeated at other Buddhist temples throughout Japan. North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs cast a shadow over Japan’s hopes for peace, said 33-year-old cab driver Masaru Eguchi, who was ready to be busy all night shuttling shrine visitors. “The world situation has grown so complex,” Eguchi said, adding that he also worried about possible terrorism targeting Japan. “I feel this very abstracted sense of uncertainty, although I really have no idea what might happen.” ___ After spending an exhausting year that saw a presidency toppled by a corruption scandal and nuclear-armed North Korea firing missile after missile, South Koreans enter 2018 in need of a happy distraction. The upcoming winter Olympics just might do it. Thousands of people filled the streets near Seoul’s City Hall for a traditional bell-tolling ceremony to usher in the new year. The group of dignitaries picked to ring the old Bosingak bell at midnight included Soohorang and Bandabi — the tiger and bear mascots for the Pyeongchang Winter Games and Paralympics in February and March. Tens of thousands of people were expected to flock to eastern coastal areas, including Gangneung, the seaside city that will host the Olympic skating and hockey events, to watch the sun rise on 2018. ___ Security was tight in the southern Indian city of Bangalore to prevent a repeat of incidents of alleged groping and molestation of several women during last year’s New Year’s Eve celebrations. Sunil Kumar, the city’s police commissioner, said at least 15,000 police officers were on duty and were being aided by drones and additional closed-circuit television cameras. Last year, police first denied that any sexual harassment had taken place during the celebrations in Bangalore, India’s information technology hub. But later, police detained at least six men after several video clips of women being attacked by groups of men spread on social media. ___ Hours before midnight, authorities had already reported that scores of people had been injured by celebratory firecrackers in the Philippines, which has some of the most raucous New Year’s celebrations in Asia. Although the number of injuries has tapered off in recent years, largely due to hard economic times and government scare campaigns, the figures remain alarming. President Rodrigo Duterte signed an order in June confining the use of firecrackers to community-designated areas, such as near shopping malls and parks. Many Filipinos, largely influenced by Chinese tradition, believe that noisy New Year’s celebrations drive away evil and misfortune. But they have carried that superstition to extremes, exploding dangerously large firecrackers and firing guns to welcome the new year despite threats of arrest. ___ Security measures were ramped up across Turkey, which was hit by a New Year’s attack a year ago that killed dozens. In Istanbul alone, 37,000 officers were on duty, with multiple streets closed to traffic and large vehicles barred from entering certain districts. Several New Year’s Eve street parties were canceled for security reasons. Early on Jan. 1, 2017, an assailant shot his way into Istanbul’s Reina nightclub, where hundreds were celebrating New Year’s. Thirty-nine people were killed — mostly foreigners — and 79 wounded. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. On Sunday, some 100 people gathered outside the nightclub to remember the victims of the attack. ___ Romanians prepared to usher in a new year in which the focus is expected to be an anti-corruption fight as the government seeks to push through legislation that critics say will make it harder to punish high-level graft. Television stations broadcast live from supermarkets full of last-minute shoppers, while beauty salons reported full bookings as revelers geared up for traditional celebrations of copious meals that can run to hundreds of euros (dollars). Others meditated and prayed at Orthodox churches and monasteries. In rural eastern Romania, villagers danced traditional pantomime-like jigs to welcome the new year, wrapping themselves in bear furs or dressing as horses. In his New Year message, President Klaus Iohannis praised Romanians who staged the largest protests since the end of communism. ___ Tens of thousands of revelers will ring in the new year in Las Vegas under the close eye of law enforcement just three months after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Tourism officials expect about 330,000 people to come to Las Vegas for the festivities, which are anchored by a roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven casino-hotels.Related Articles

150,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/dec/31/developing-deputies-down-after-being-called-suburb/,"A man fired more than 100 rounds at sheriff's deputies in Colorado early Sunday, killing one and injuring four others, before being fatally shot himself in what authorities called an ambush. Two civilians were also injured. Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said deputies came under fire almost immediately after entering a suburban Denver apartment and trying to talk with the suspect, who was holed up inside a bedroom. ""I do know that all of them were shot very, very quickly. They all went down almost within seconds of each other, so it was more of an ambush-type of attack on our officers,"" Spurlock said. ""He knew we were coming and we obviously let him know that we were there."" The wounded deputies tried to pull the fallen officer, identified as Zackari Parrish, out of the line of further gunfire but were unable to because of their own injuries and only managed to ""crawl to safety,"" Spurlock said. The incident occurred around 5:15 a.m. at Copper Canyon Apartments, a landscaped apartment complex in Highland Ranch, 16 miles (28 kilometers) south of Denver. Authorities had left the home about four hours earlier to address a noise complaint but returned in response to reports of a disturbance at the home. There were two men inside the home when deputies arrived and someone let them inside, Spurlock said. The disturbance was initially reported to be domestic but turned out to be noise-related, he said. ""The suspect was just making a ton of noise and annoying everyone around him,"" Spurlock said. Resident Steven Silknitter, 50, told The Denver Post that he heard 15 to 20 shots. ""It was back and forth — unbelievable,"" said Silknitter, who lived in the Denver suburb of Aurora during a 2012 movie theater shooting that left 12 dead. ""Where do you move to?"" he said, shaking his head in exasperation. ""It's everywhere."" The suspect was well-known to authorities in the Denver area but had no criminal record, said Spurlock, who declined to name him until his identity was confirmed. The sheriff did not release any details about the weapons and ammunition used except to say the suspect had a rifle. He also did not know if law enforcement had any prior knowledge of firearms being in the home but the possibility always weighs on deputies' minds. ""We respond to every call anticipating that everyone has a gun. This is Colorado. Everybody has a gun,"" Spurlock said. Parrish, the slain officer, was 29 and a married father of two young children. He came to the department seven months ago after working as an officer for the nearby Castle Rock Police Department. Spurlock called him a ""good kid"" who was eager to work. ""His wife told me today that he loved this job more than he had loved any job he ever had,"" the sheriff said. The three deputies and one police officer injured were listed in stable condition. Authorities identified them as deputies Michael Doyle, 28; Taylor Davis, 30; Jeffrey Pelle, 32; and Castle Rock police officer Tom O'Donnell, 41. The two civilian injuries were not life-threatening. Pelle is the son of Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle. The sheriff said his son underwent surgery from injuries suffered in the attack and was recovering. President Donald Trump expressed sorrow, writing on Twitter, ""My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @dcsheriff, and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all!"" The shooting occurred on the final day of a year that saw the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas.

John Leyba/The Denver Post via AP David Morgan of Highlands Ranch, Colo., holds an American flag as a procession of law enforcement vehicles accompany a hearse carrying the body of a sheriff's deputy shot and killed while responding to a domestic disturbance Sunday, Dec. 31, 2017, in Highlands Ranch, Colo.  AP Photo/David Zalubowski Note: This story was updated at 8:30 p.m. DENVER — A man fired more than 100 rounds at sheriff's deputies in Colorado early Sunday, killing one and injuring four others, before being fatally shot himself in what authorities called an ambush. Two civilians were also injured. Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said deputies came under fire almost immediately and were shot ""very, very quickly"" after entering a suburban Denver apartment and trying to talk with the suspect, who was holed up inside a bedroom. ""They all went down almost within seconds of each other, so it was more of an ambush-type of attack on our officers,"" Spurlock said. ""He knew we were coming and we obviously let him know that we were there."" The Douglas County coroner identified the suspect as 37-year-old Matthew Riehl. A YouTube user named Matthew Riehl posted a YouTube video Dec. 13, saying he wanted to replace Spurlock and railing against the sheriff and other officers in profane, highly personal terms. The wounded deputies tried to pull the fallen officer, Zackari Parrish, out of the line of further gunfire but were unable to because of their own injuries and only managed to ""crawl to safety,"" Spurlock said. The incident began around 5:15 a.m. at Copper Canyon Apartments, a landscaped apartment complex in Highland Ranch, 16 miles south of Denver. Authorities had left the home barely an hour earlier in response to a complaint of a ""verbal disturbance"" involving two men, the sheriff's office said. One of the men told them the suspect ""was acting bizarre and might be having a mental breakdown"" but the deputies found no evidence of a crime. When deputies were called back, a man who had left came by to give them a key and granted permission to enter the home, leaving again before shots were fired. ""The suspect was just making a ton of noise and annoying everyone around him,"" Spurlock said. Four officers, including Parrish, were shot from a bedroom around 6 a.m., forcing the retreat. A SWAT team entered the apartment at about 7:30 a.m. in an exchange of gunfire that left the gunman dead and another officer injured. Vira Cover, who lives in a building about 50 yards away from the shooting, was woken up by a phone call from her fiance, Steve Silknitter, who warned her about what was happening and urged her to stay inside. Soon afterward she said she heard about 15 to 20 very loud shots fired over about 30 seconds or a minute. She sat on the couch with her cats and called Silknitter back before turning on the television to try to find out more about what was happening. ""I couldn't believe this was happening in our backyard,"" she said. Silknitter heard the shots fired too but from about a half mile away, stopped at a police roadblock as he tried to get back home from work. Then he said he saw police in tactical gear speed past him in a pickup truck. Silknitter said he lived 2 miles away from the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado where 12 people were killed in a shooting in 2012. He said he never would have expected anything like this in his apartment complex, where the only noise you might normally hear is children running around upstairs. ""Where do I move to where I don't have to worry about someone shooting us?"" asked Silknitter, who is now considering getting a concealed weapons permit. The suspect was well-known to authorities in the Denver area but had no criminal record, said Spurlock, who declined to name him until his identity was confirmed. Riehl said in his Dec. 13 YouTube video, called ""Fire Sheriff Spurlock,"" that he would run as a libertarian, ending with holiday greetings and a vow to ""fire all these bums come early next year."" Riehl is vague about his political beliefs and personal grievances, though his animosity clearly ran deep. He flashes the business card of an officer who, he says, shows up at homes after sunset with an attractive woman and ""will then ambush you from behind the door."" A video posted on Nov. 28 shows a traffic stop by a police officer in the city of Lone Tree — apparently taken inside the officer's car — that Riehl said was done illegally. He alleges the officer clocked the wrong driver, identifying the officer by name in the video and calling him ""dirty."" ""Scumbag, dirtbag, liar,"" he says as the officer questions the driver. ""He's the boss, huh? He's the Nazi in charge with the stripes on his shoulder and the fake badge."" The sheriff did not release any details about the weapons and ammunition used except to say the suspect had a rifle. He also did not know if law enforcement had any prior knowledge of firearms being in the home but the possibility always weighs on deputies' minds. ""We respond to every call anticipating that everyone has a gun. This is Colorado. Everybody has a gun,"" Spurlock said. Parrish, the slain officer, was 29 and a married father of two young children. He came to the department seven months ago after working as an officer for the nearby Castle Rock Police Department. Spurlock called him a ""good kid"" who was eager to work. ""His wife told me today that he loved this job more than he had loved any job he ever had,"" the sheriff said. Gov. John Hickenlooper ordered flags on all public buildings immediately lowered to half-staff until Tuesday evening in Parrish's honor. The three deputies and one police officer injured were listed in stable condition. Authorities identified them as deputies Michael Doyle, 28; Taylor Davis, 30; Jeffrey Pelle, 32; and Castle Rock police officer Tom O'Donnell, 41. The two civilian injuries were not life-threatening. Pelle is the son of Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle. The sheriff shared a picture of him and two other family members by his son's hospital bed on his office Twitter account. All four, including Jeffrey Pelle, who underwent surgery, are smiling and giving a thumbs-up gesture. President Donald Trump expressed sorrow, writing on Twitter, ""My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @dcsheriff, and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all!"" The shooting occurred on the final day of a year that saw the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas. __ Associated Press writers Sadie Gurman in Washington, Terry Tang in Phoenix and photographer David Zalubowski in Denver contributed to this report.

158,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/jan/01/new-year-starts-cold-in-nyc-20180101/,"NEW YORK -- New Yorkers, celebrity entertainers and tourists from around the world packed into a frigid Times Square on Sunday to mark the start of 2018 with a glittering crystal ball drop, a burst of more than a ton of confetti and midnight fireworks. It was only 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the city, and the celebration was less crowded than in other years. Some of the metal pens, usually packed with people, were only half-full. Some revelers, bundled up in hats, gloves, face masks and numerous layers of clothing, jogged to keep warm, as others bounced and danced. Some stood and shivered. Security in the area was at an all-time high after a year that saw several fatal attacks on large crowds, including one in Times Square last spring. Mariah Carey made it through her set on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest after bungling the performance the previous year. She dressed in a floor-length gown and a furry white coat, performing her 1990s hits ""Vision of Love"" and ""Hero."" The dazzling finale of the show was the traditional drop of a Waterford Crystal ball down a pole atop 1 Times Square. This year, the ball was 12 feet in diameter, weighed 11,875 pounds and was covered with 2,688 triangles that change colors like a kaleidoscope, illuminated by 32,256 LED lights. When the first ball drop happened in 1907, it was made of iron and wood and adorned with 100 25-watt light bulbs. The first celebration in the area was in 1904, the same year the city's first subway line started running. Reveler Colleen Keenan, who along with her son braved the cold in Times Square, said the celebration was ""a beautiful experience"" and that ""there's nothing like it."" Remle Scott, 22, and her boyfriend Brad Whittaker, 22, of San Diego, arrived shortly after 9 a.m., saying they were trying to keep a positive attitude as temperatures hovered in the teens. Each was wearing several layers of clothing. ""Our toes are frozen, so we're just dealing with it by dancing."" Scott said. Some wore red scarfs that read ""Happy New Year"" and others donned yellow and purple hats as a pizza deliveryman sold pies to the hungry crowd. In a prime viewing spot near 42nd Street, Alexander Ebrahim grinned as he looked around at the flashing lights of Times Square. ""I always saw it on TV, so I thought why not come out and see it in person,"" said the 19-year-old from Orange County, Calif. ""It's an experience you can never forget."" Michael Waller, 45, made a snap decision on Saturday evening to drive straight from Columbus, Ohio. He made it to Times Square at 8 a.m. and waited all day in front of the ball. ""I didn't want to stay home for this, by myself,"" he said. The New Year's celebration was the city's second-coldest on record. The coldest ball drop celebration was in 1917, when it was only 1 degree. As revelers celebrated in Times Square, police were taking no chances with security. Garages in the area were emptied of cars and sealed off. Detectives were stationed at area hotels working with security officials to prevent sniper attacks. Thousands of uniformed officers lined the streets. Cement blocks and sanitation trucks blocked vehicles from entering the secure area where spectators gathered. Revelers had to pass through one of a dozen checkpoints where they were screened and then screened again as they made their way to the main event. At the corner of 48th Street and Seventh Avenue, Chris Garcia, his girlfriend Zayra Velazquez and her brother Edgar Valdez stood rigidly, having waited in the cold for almost six hours. Valdez, 19, said he felt ""pretty safe"" at the event. ""They checked us pretty good,"" he said. ""Police checked what we had, and another scanned us with metal detectors."" The Police Department estimates that it costs $7.5 million to protect the event. In Las Vegas, revelers were ringing in the new year under the close eye of law enforcement just three months after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Tourism officials expected about 330,000 people to go to Las Vegas for the festivities, which are anchored by a roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven casino-hotels. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department was to have every officer working Sunday, while the Nevada National Guard activated about 350 soldiers and airmen. The federal government also sent dozens of personnel to assist with intelligence and other efforts. PRAYER FOR THE WORLD Pope Francis on Sunday decried wars, injustices, social and environmental degradation and other man-made ills which he said spoiled the year. Francis presided at a New Year's Eve prayer service in St. Peter's Basilica, a traditional occasion to say thanks in each year's last hours. In his homily, the pope said God gave to us a ""whole and sound"" year, but ""we humans in so many ways ruined and hurt it with works of death, with lies and injustices."" ""The wars are the flagrant sign of this repeated and absurd pride,"" he said. ""But so are all the little and big offenses against life, truth, brotherhood, that cause multiple forms of human, social and environmental degradation."" Francis added: ""We want to, and must assume, before God, our brothers and Creation our responsibility"" for the harm. Despite the gloom, Francis said ""gratitude prevails"" thanks to those who ""cooperate silently for the common good."" He singled out parents and educators who try to raise young people with a sense of responsible ethics. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday issued a ""red alert"" for more unity in 2018 after what he called a year of setbacks. Nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise, inequality is growing, climate change is accelerating and the world is seeing horrific violations of human rights, he said. Global anxieties about nuclear weapons were the highest since the Cold War. The Portuguese diplomat made no mention of specific countries in his brief New Year's message. Guterres said he took office a year ago with an appeal that 2017 would be a year of peace ""Unfortunately -- in fundamental ways, the world has gone in reverse,"" he said. ""On New Year's Day 2018, I am not issuing an appeal. I am issuing an alert -- a red alert for our world."" REMEMBERING VICTIMS Some 100 people gathered outside an Istanbul nightclub Sunday to remember the victims of a deadly New Year's attack a year ago. The group, holding carnations, observed a moment of silence. Among them were families of victims and consular and local officials. Islamic, Christian and Jewish prayers were recited. Early on Jan. 1, 2017, an assailant shot his way into the Reina nightclub where hundreds were celebrating the New Year. Thirty-nine people were killed -- mostly foreigners -- and 79 wounded. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Lead suspect Abdulkadir Masharipov was apprehended in a police operation after two weeks in hiding. He is on trial along with 56 others. MIDEAST, EUROPE Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, again served as the focal point of New Year's Eve celebrations -- though this year authorities decided against fireworks and chose a massive LED light show on the structure. That was in part due to safety in the city-state in the United Arab Emirates, which saw a massive skyscraper fire on New Year's Eve in 2015. The display, running down the east side of the 2,716-foot tower, showed Arabic calligraphy, geometric designs and a portrait of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE's first president. But a display of neighboring nations' flags didn't show Qatar's flag. The UAE joined Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in boycotting the nation in June over allegations Doha supports extremists and has too close ties to Iran. Qatar, which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, denies supporting extremists and shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran. Tens of thousands of Parisians and tourists were heading to the Champs-Elysees to attend a firework show at Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe monument, at the end of the famous avenue with its lines of trees sparkling with lights. New Year's Eve celebrations were placed under high security in France, which has been hit by a series of attacks by Islamic extremists in recent years. French Interior ministry said 100,000 police officers and soldiers and 40,000 rescuers were deployed across the country -- including 2,500 on the Champs-Elysees. Fireworks lit up the sky above Sydney Harbor. The fireworks display included a rainbow waterfall cascade of lights and color flowing off the harbor's bridge to celebrate recently passed legislation legalizing gay marriage in Australia. Germans were to ring in 2018 under tight security from police mindful of widespread sexual abuse of women in Cologne two years ago and of a terrorist attack on a Christmas market last year. Police in Berlin added 1,600 officers on duty and said that large bags and knapsacks would not be allowed on the ""Party Mile"" leading from Brandenburg Gate, where thousands were expected to celebrate at midnight. Police in Frankfurt imposed similar restrictions in the celebration area along the Main River in the country's financial capital. Two years ago, New Year's in Cologne was marred by groping and theft committed against hundreds of women, in most cases by migrants. On Dec. 19, 2016, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri drove a stolen truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people. Security was also tight in the southern Indian city of Bangalore to prevent a repeat of incidents of alleged groping and molestation of several women during last year's New Year's Eve celebrations. Sunil Kumar, the city's police commissioner, said at least 15,000 police officers were on duty and were being aided by drones and additional closed-circuit television cameras.

159,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/jan/01/shooter-targets-lawmen-kills-one-201801-1/,"DENVER -- A gunman fired more than 100 rounds at law enforcement officers in Colorado early Sunday, killing one and injuring four others before being fatally shot himself. Two civilians were also injured. Killed in the attack was Zackari Parrish, a 29-year-old deputy who had worked for the Douglas County sheriff's office for seven months, Sheriff Tony Spurlock said at an afternoon news conference. He described Parrish as a ""smiley kid"" who was eager to serve. He is survived by a wife and two young children. Describing his meeting with the deputy's widow, the sheriff said, ""When I held her hand and looked in her eyes, I could see her life was over."" Spurlock said the man has had encounters with law enforcement authorities in the area, though he had no criminal history. Hours after the attack, numerous questions remained, including the public identification of the gunman, his motive, the type of weapon he used, what exactly happened leading up to the attack and where the officers were positioned in relation to the suspect. The gunfire shattered a quiet morning at the Copper Canyon Apartments, which describes itself on its website as having some of the ""friendliest apartments"" in Highlands Ranch, Colo., about 15 miles south of Denver. Sheriff's deputies were first called to the apartment at 1:30 a.m. when a man told officers that his roommate was acting bizarrely and might have been having a mental breakdown. The sheriff's office said the officers left less than an hour later after determining that no one had committed a crime. About four hours later, authorities were called for what was described as a ""domestic disturbance,"" the sheriff said. Four deputies who arrived within minutes of one another went inside after the suspect's roommate, who had left the apartment, went back and gave the officers a key to get in, according to the sheriff's office. As outlined by the sheriff, what happened next was murky. The officers were talking to the suspect for about 30 minutes, and at some point the gunman barricaded himself in a bedroom. ""The suspect was just making a ton of noise and annoying everyone around him,"" Spurlock said. Parrish was shot multiple times. The other officers, who were hit in areas not covered by their protective vests, were in stable condition, the sheriff said. The wounded officers tried to pull Parrish out of the line of further gunfire but were unable to because of their own injuries and only managed to ""crawl to safety,"" Spurlock said. As the injured officers extricated themselves, the gunman continue to fire ""for some time"" until he was shot and killed by the officers, Spurlock said. A SWAT team went inside the apartment around 7:30 a.m., the sheriff's office said. The suspect was shot and killed, and an officer from another police department was injured during an exchange of gunfire. The wounded officers are Michael Doyle, 28, Taylor Davis, 30, Jeff Pelle, 32, all of whom are sheriff's deputies; and Tom O'Donnell, 41, an officer with the Castle Rock Police Department. All were listed in stable condition, Spurlock said. The gunman also shot two civilians, who suffered injuries that weren't considered life-threatening. Spurlock described what happened as ""almost an ambush-type of attack"" and said the gunman fired ""very, very quickly"" with a rifle, though it was unclear what type. ""He knew we were there, and he knew we were coming,"" the sheriff said. He predicted a prolonged investigation that would draw on footage from body cameras worn by the officers. The sheriff did not release any details about the weapons and ammunition used in the attack, except to say the man had a rifle. He did not know whether law enforcement authorities had any previous knowledge of firearms being in the home but said the possibility always weighs on deputies' minds. ""We respond to every call anticipating that everyone has a gun. This is Colorado. Everybody has a gun,"" Spurlock said. Family members of Pelle rushed from their homes in Northern Colorado to the hospital after getting word he had been shot. Pelle was in visible pain when his family saw him in the intensive care unit after he emerged from surgery, his sister, Shanna Jessen, said in a phone interview. She said he seemed less concerned with his condition than with how his two young nephews had taken the news that their uncle had been shot. Jessen described her younger brother as a broad-shouldered former football player who was ""built like Superman"" with a sensitive ""marshmallow heart."" Jessen said Pelle had been shot under the armpit and that the bullet had traveled down his torso to his hip. She said he was doing ""remarkably well"" after surgery. He comes from a law enforcement family. Pelle's father, Joe, is the longtime sheriff of Boulder County, Colo. Jessen said her brother has been in law enforcement for about seven years and has been looking forward to celebrating his fifth wedding anniversary on Tuesday. Gov. John Hickenlooper ordered that flags on all public buildings be immediately lowered to half-staff until Tuesday evening in Parrish's honor. President Donald Trump expressed sorrow, writing on Twitter: ""My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County dcsheriff, and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all!"" A resident of the apartment complex, Steven Silknitter, said he was trying to make his way past a police cordon Sunday morning when he heard what sounded like a fierce exchange of gunfire. ""Fifteen to 20 gunshots,"" he said. ""Return fire and then more fire."" Silknitter, 50, described the apartment complex as a mix of families, couples and older residents and said neither he nor his fiancee, Vira Cover, had ever felt unsafe there or knew of any reports of violence. ""Highlands Ranch is one of the safest places in the Denver area,"" said Cover, 50, who was on the sofa when she heard gunshots. ""I cannot believe this happened in our backyard."" Silknitter said he lived 2 miles away from the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting in 2012. He said he never would have expected anything like this in his apartment complex, where the only noise he might normally hear is children running around upstairs. ""Where do I move to where I don't have to worry about someone shooting us?"" asked Silknitter, who said he is now considering getting a concealed weapons permit.

There is much you can do with thinking through a New Year’s column. In review, 2017 was a tumultuous year. Our politics were fractious. Republicans failed to legislatively disassemble Obamacare but then succeeded in their tax reform. President Trump and the news media were at war. James Comey at the FBI was fired, triggering the Mueller investigation into Russian collusion which grinds on. The Justice Department is accused of tanking an investigation into the Clinton emails and accusations about “pay to play” with the sale of Uranium One to the Russians. Neil Gorsuch goes to the Supreme Court. Internationally, North Korea intensified as a nuclear threat and China rose in influence. There was worsening unrest in Yemen and Iran, and the U.S. embassy plans to move to Jerusalem. The biggest story perhaps is the near total destruction of ISIS in Syria and Iraq. In 2017, the United States suffered hurricanes and wildfires. Racial tensions persist. Opioid-related deaths mounted. There was Howard Weinstein, Anthony Weiner, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and Judge Roy Moore. We had terror attacks, and the awful dark insanity of the Las Vegas mass shooting. Last year, the Patriots won the greatest Super Bowl comeback of all times, and the Houston Astros won a Cinderella World Series. The Academy Awards were embarrassed by announcing the wrong winner for best film. Making predictions for the coming year is fun to do. I take the Patriots over Minnesota in the Super Bowl, and then Tom Brady announces his retirement. The New York Yankees will crush Major League Baseball in a barrage of home runs harkening back to the great Yankee teams of the 1960s. Even though I haven’t seen it, “The Post” will win the Academy Award simply because it is about an iconic liberal news outlet, The Washington Post, taking on the power of a conservative government, starring Meryl Streep as a woman who comes to terms with her authority. The Academy Awards won’t be able to resist this. My choices for the best film in 2017 otherwise go to “Three Billboards Outside of Ebbings, Missouri,” “Lady Bird” or the remarkably brilliant animated “Loving Vincent.” Trying to predict events in politics or international affairs is a fool’s errand. There are simply too many complexities and moving parts. Perhaps the best approach is to hope for some peace and equanimity and an absence of unpleasant surprises in 2018. I want to take the transition from 2017 to 2018 to reflect on writing on the editorial pages of this particular newspaper in this particular locality and its politics. Most of the columns here are political in nature, and it is obvious that I write a column that is moderately conservative and that the great predominance of columns and letters written on these pages are politically very liberal. I am hesitant in making the following observation about many of those other entries, and I truly hope this is taken in the constructive manner in which it is meant. Much is written on these pages reflecting a visceral hatred of the current president using language that is extraordinary in its venom. Just last week a writer likened the president to Dante’s circles of hell and the Trump administration to Nazi Germany. Another writer described Republican politics as a “war on the American people.” There is at times an extremism and repetitiveness among these writings that will only speak to those who share that hatred. Reading some of these columns and letters seems like those authors are yelling in an echo chamber. Yes, of course the current federal government with Republicans in power takes positions that are contrary to those of liberals. It was not that very long ago that the federal government had Democrats in power with policies that were contrary to conservative positions. That is the way of democracy. It is completely appropriate to disagree with policies and positions, but perhaps it would be useful to take a deep breath and separate those disagreements from hyperbolic personal attacks, and to remember that there are large swaths of the American public who agree with the policies that those on the left find unacceptable. In the space between reviewing the events of the year past and anticipating the near future is a moment to pause and think about important matters that are not political. The new year is an opportunity to be thankful for the people who share our lives: for family and friends, co-workers and colleagues. It is a chance to be thankful for work. As a physician, I have the good fortune of never having to end my day thinking that I’ve wasted my time. At the point of moving from one year to the next, it is important to remember that the most valuable commodity we have is certainly not money, but is time. It is also a chance to be thankful for simply being alive. Life is this remarkable phenomenon, an inestimable gift. Those among us who had have problems or losses in their family or with their friends, those who have difficulty providing economically, and those who are in poor or perilous health should get our thoughts for the new year. For you, a happy new year. Jay Fleitman, M.D., of Northampton writes a monthly column. He can be reached at opinion@gazettenet.com.

Michael Wolfe, 37, pleaded guilty to vandalism and hate crime charges on Tuesday and received his sentence the next day. After the 15-year prison sentence, Wolfe will also serve 15 years probation.
Advertisement Wolfe was facing a potential life sentence before the plea deal. The spokesman for the State Attorney's Office of Brevard and Seminole County said in a statement that Wolfe was sentenced as a Habitual Felony Offender and also received a hate crime enhancement. Imam Muhammad Musri, the senior imam and president of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, said the sentence sends a message that hate crimes will not be tolerated. ""The intent is to really deter similar kinds of hate crime. After what we've seen in Texas at the church, this is needed,"" Musri told Florida Today, referring to the mass shooting at a Christian church that killed 26 people. ""Our schools, our churches, our theaters, it's a red line. It's heartbreaking. The hate must stop.""
Advertisement In January 2016, surveillance video at the Masjid al-Mumin mosque in Titusville, Fla. caught Wolfe using a machete to break windows, lights and surveillance cameras. He then left a slab of raw bacon at the front door of the mosque. Pork is prohibited under Islamic law. Police said the total cost of damage Wolfe inflicted on the mosque totaled about $800, according to the Orlando Sentinel.",2017-12-06 23:47:55,"Florida man gets 15 years for vandalizing mosque with machete, bacon",,1706,http://www.upi.com/

By John Woodrow Cox | Washington Post LAS VEGAS — The varsity cheerleaders had just finished practice when Natalia Baca stepped out into the school parking lot and spotted a tall, dark-haired teenager holding a bouquet of multicolored sunflowers. “Will you go to homecoming with me?” he said as she approached with her identical twin, Gianna, who had helped orchestrate the moment. Natalia pressed both hands against her cheeks and grinned, because no one had ever asked her to the dance before. “Yes,” Natalia answered, already imagining what she would look like in her open-back, iridescent white dress that flashed shades of pink and blue in the sunlight. They hugged and talked for a few minutes before she and Gianna had to go. The seniors, age 17, were running late for a country music concert. The Las Vegas sun had long faded beneath a distant mountain range on that first day in October, so the twins hurried back inside Faith Lutheran High to change clothes. Jason Aldean, Natalia’s favorite singer, was scheduled to perform the final set at that weekend’s Route 91 Harvest festival. Reading this on your phone?

It was a Sunday, a school night, so most people in the crowd of 22,000 would be adults, but some kids would be there, too, including 10 students from Faith, a private Christian academy in an affluent community of gated neighborhoods nine miles west of the Strip. And in that evening’s earliest moments, before the gunman high above them pulled the trigger, the twins and their classmates were eager for the week ahead — first the music, then the homecoming dress-up days, the silly lip-sync competition, the pep rally, the football game and, at last, on Saturday, the dance. About the time Natalia said yes in the parking lot, Faith juniors Shae Turner and Delaney Sylvester settled in 50 yards from the stage, right of the catwalk, on the side nearest Las Vegas Boulevard and the Mandalay Bay Resort. The morning before, Shae had posted a photo to Instagram from Friday night. In it, the two girls each posed with one hand positioned on a hip so their purple festival bracelets, that weekend’s status symbol, would be in view. The best friends, both in brown cowboy boots, stood with their backs to the neon-lit stage, eyes bright and smiles radiant. They’d each turned 17 just weeks before. Beneath the image, Shae wrote a caption: “country music makes us happy #route91.” For seven months, she had looked forward to this weekend. “Happy early Birthday present,” her mom had texted March 3 with an image of the ticket confirmation. “OMG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!” Shae wrote back, with four heart emoji. “I’m freaking out… like on the verge of tears thank you!” The girls planned for weeks what they would wear to the festival and during homecoming week. Shae — the daughter of two FBI agents who had inherited her parents’ attention to detail – narrowed her Route 91 outfit options to seven before she texted photos to Delaney and they cut it down to three. They went to Forever 21 in a mall on the Strip to pick up yellow skirts and shirts for the school’s “Color Day” — “Nobody owns yellow,” Shae, the junior class treasurer, had unsuccessfully argued to her fellow student council members. At Delaney’s prodding, Shae picked a pair of four-inch floral Steve Madden heels for the dance that, by the time they headed to the register, she adored. For the festival weekend, Shae’s mom, Elena Turner, rented a room and stayed with the girls through Sunday morning at the Delano hotel, next to Mandalay Bay, so they wouldn’t have to drive home after each evening’s performances. In the lobby, before they headed to Route 91’s opening night, Elena gave them one last reminder. “If there’s an active shooter in the crowd,” she began, and Shae knew what came next. She’d been hearing that speech from her parents, who had met during their FBI training, for at least five years, ever since a movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., left 12 people dead. “Run until you can’t run,” Elena continued. “Hide until you can’t hide. Fight until you can’t fight.” Her daughter smiled. “Mom, don’t worry,” Shae said. “Everything will be fine.” Marie Langer’s mother, Susan, assumed everything would be fine, too. It was, after all, a country music festival, filled with people who’d come to take a break from their problems, not start any. Her daughter, also a Faith junior, had raved all weekend about how friendly the other concertgoers were. Determined to see Aldean up close, Marie had valeted her 2016 white Ford Mustang at Mandalay Bay at 2:30 that Sunday afternoon and walked over to the festival site a half-hour before the first band went on the main stage. She and a classmate, Summer Stadtlander, both 16, were so giddy that, on their way, they’d skipped together up Las Vegas Boulevard. Summer had texted Marie that morning, saying she’d just listened to “so much jason aldean and I’m so excited now.” “ME TOO,” Marie responded. Then: “IM EXCITED TO BE FRONT ROW.” Then: “AND TOUCH HIM.” Marie, an accomplished equestrian show jumper, had twice traveled to Europe and was a veteran of superstar concerts – Rihanna, Drake, Nicki Minaj – but something about Aldean’s simple, Georgia-bred twang always made her feel good. She had followed his tour schedule for two years, hoping to hear him in person, before her chance finally came that Sunday. The 15-acre venue was mostly empty when the girls arrived, giving them their choice of places to stand along a railing that lined the catwalk. “Should we go on the right side today?” Marie asked, but Summer suggested they stick with the left, near where the friends had stood both previous nights. They normally did homework on Sundays but wanted no distractions on this one. Before they got there, Marie had already finished her American Revolution reading guides and Summer her Algebra II assignment. At 4:50 p.m., Marie — whose fingernails were painted paisley and plaid, because that was the most country design she could think of — sent her mom a photo of a guitar pick she’d caught when a member of the Josh Abbott Band tossed it out. Not long after, a stagehand gave her a copy of Big & Rich’s set list. “Oh my gosh,” Marie shrieked, bouncing up and down. At 7:51, her mom texted to ask who was playing. “Waiting for Jake Owen then Jason aldean,” Marie responded. “Be safe. We luv u tons.” “Luv u.” At 9:30, her mom sent a final message: “Call house phone uf emergency. Cell phone going off.” Then the lights went dark and the crowd roared as Marie pointed her phone’s camera to record Aldean’s entrance. His introduction video, a collage of mud, pickups and cowboy hats, appeared on a massive screen behind the stage. “The suspense right now is insane,” Marie told a girl standing next to her. In the crowd behind them, about 30 yards back and to the right, Natalia felt the same. She’d gotten a ticket for Sunday just hours earlier, delighting her not only because of Aldean but because Gianna would be there, too. She and her twin did almost everything together. It had been that way from the beginning, when the girls were born eight weeks premature and began their lives fighting to keep them. They’d never spent more than 48 hours apart. Now the sisters were sharing the first music festival they’d gone to without a parent, and Aldean was on stage, crooning about people tougher than they look. “They ain’t seen the blood, sweat and tears it took to live their dreams,” Natalia sang along as she danced with friends, and Gianna, a dozen feet away, did the same with her boyfriend. About 15 minutes into the set, a few others in their group told Natalia that they were heading to the bathrooms, in the back of the venue, and asked if she needed to go, too. She did, but refused to miss a single song. “I’ll just wait,” she said. “It’s okay.” She stayed, swaying and laughing until 10:05 p.m., when the sound of pops from somewhere faraway cut through the music. “Did you hear that?” she asked a friend. Maybe, she thought, someone had set off fireworks. Natalia peered up above the stage and into the night sky, searching for bursts of light. All she saw was darkness. — “Get down!” someone in the crowd shouted as Natalia watched Aldean rush offstage amid a second barrage. She dropped to her knees and covered her head. A friend, Kaitlyn Burton, 19, huddled alongside, clutching Natalia’s hands. “What’s happening?” Natalia asked, unaware that, just in front of where she was hunkered, a half dozen people had already collapsed to the turf, struck by bullets fired from Mandalay Bay’s 32nd floor, 400 yards away. Natalia looked up, trembling as she searched for Gianna in the chaotic,howling mass of bodies crouched and crawling around her. Her twin was nowhere in sight. “God, please help us,” she prayed, but now the wails grew louder, and the crackle drew closer. Then, suddenly, what felt like a steel medicine ball slammed into her right shoulder blade, striking with such force that she was shoved to the left, losing her grip on Kaitlyn’s hand. Natalia’s back stung, as though it had been lit ablaze. “Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!” she cried. The impact jolted her friend, too. Even before Kaitlyn saw the blood, she knew what that meant. “Natalia’s been shot,” she yelled at her boyfriend, Riley Van Buskirk, who until then had remained standing, frozen in shock. He stared down at the hole in Natalia’s back, then stripped off his long-sleeved denim Wrangler shirt and wrapped it diagonally around her chest and back, hoping it would apply enough pressure to slow the bleeding. As he helped her up, Riley felt the cracked bones along Natalia’s shoulders grind against each other. He feared what the bullet had done inside her. Overwhelmed, Natalia couldn’t process what was happening — the words that Kaitlyn had spoken or the burn now spreading from her back to her chest. And as she staggered to her feet, Natalia still didn’t see Gianna. Had her twin been shot, too? Then came more gunfire. “Run!” Kaitlyn hollered. At that moment, Shae, the daughter of the FBI agents, was already sprinting with her friend Delaney toward a row of outdoor beer vendors. When they reached them, the girls dove to the ground, cowering just beneath a purple billboard that overlooked Las Vegas Boulevard. “LIVE MUSIC,” it advertised, with an arrow pointing back toward the ongoing massacre behind them. Shae, who suspected it was gunfire as soon as she heard it, had immediately grabbed her friend’s arm and begun pushing through the crowd. She decided that fleeing toward the venue’s rear or east-side exits, along with thousands of other people, would leave the girls too exposed. Instead, Shae headed toward the nearest cover on the venue’s western edge. Now, with bullets spraying overhead, they were trapped. Shae pressed her cellphone against her ear. “Mom,” she said, “someone is shooting into the crowd.” “Are you sure?” asked Elena, who was in her bedroom, about to go to sleep. “Yes, I’m sure.” Then, what sounded to Elena’s trained ear like machine-gun fire exploded through the phone’s speaker. Stay calm, her mom told her. Stay calm. Elena, voice quavering, asked whether they could make it to Shae’s car, parked over the fence and across the street at Mandalay Bay. No, Shae said, because she thought the shots might be coming from that direction. The girls knew they had to make a choice: Stay put and risk a gunman finding them, or move and risk being sniped out in the open. Hands clutched, each promised to stay with the other, before Delaney, in a pause between salvos, suggested they keep going. The beer vendors were arranged in a semicircle that jutted out into the venue, so between bursts, they crept farther along, terrified of running into the end of a barrel around every bend. When they reached the far side, the girls realized that they were, again, trapped. A gate along the fence in front of them remained shut, and behind them, in the festival’s center, was nothing but uncovered space. “We can’t get out,” Shae told her mom. “There’s no exit.” Another blast of gunshots erupted. They looked for somewhere to hide, but this time, the space beneath the nearest canopy was already full. They couldn’t get in. The girls were exposed. “What do we even do?” asked Delaney, who’d begun to cry. Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from the Bay Area and beyond. It was then that a bald man who looked to be in his late 40s scrambled over, blanketing their bodies with his own. “Stay down,” the stranger said, as he placed his hand on Delaney’s head, pressing the American flag on her camouflage baseball cap against the pavement. And when that volley had subsided and the man had left, Delaney glanced back toward the fence. “Shae,” she said, “a gate opened up.” Up next to the stage, Marie and Summer, the other pair of Faith juniors, stood from where they’d ducked behind the catwalk, opposite Mandalay Bay, and darted toward an east exit. The girls, who’d both taken videos of the chaos by then, didn’t understand the moment’s gravity until they saw — sprawled across a bloodied landscape of plastic cups, crushed beer cans and trampled cowboy hats — the wounded and the dead. Marie’s eyes stayed on her cellphone as they rushed past. She didn’t have her home number saved, and as she tried to dial it, her hands wouldn’t stop shaking. “Marie, what’s wrong?” answered her mother, Susan. “There’s a shooting. There’s a shooting. Shooter, shooter,” she blurted, barely able to pronounce the words. “You have to stop. What are you saying?” Susan asked. Still on the phone with her mom, she and Summer escaped the venue and hurried across Giles Street, where they reached the edge of a church parking lot enclosed by a seven-foot-high wrought-iron fence. “What do we do?” the 16-year-olds askeda pair of police officers on the other side, strapping on what looked like riot gear. “You need to get over here right now,” one of them said. Marie set her phone down on the fence’s brick base, then put her cowboy boot on the edge and hiked up her floor-length lime-green dress. She and Summer gripped the metal bars and pulled themselves up and over, bruising the backs of their legs on spikes that lined the top. The girls leapt into the parking lot. Marie reached back for her cell. “My phone’s at 4 percent,” she told her mom. “I have to go.” Across the road, on the festival grounds, Riley and Kaitlyn had just helped Natalia into a white medical tent where the injured were being brought for treatment. She slumped onto a plastic chair. A passing medic asked how she was doing. OK, Natalia said, even though she wasn’t. For years, the teenager had wanted to be a nurse, to help people who were worse off than she was. And there they were, screaming and staggering all around her. Go to the others, she told the medic. A man sitting next to Natalia was pressing his palms together, as if in prayer, because the fingers on one of his hands had been blown off. She recognized a guy she’d known for years lying on a cot nearby. He’d been shot in the stomach. “I need help,” he said, and Riley called out for it, but no one came, because everyone needed help. On the pavement, where blood had begun to pool, Natalia saw a man to her right with a bullet wound on the back of his neck. She watched a small group crowd around him, pressing over and over on his chest. He didn’t move. “We lost him,” she heard someone say, and they left him alone. Now Natalia began to feel lightheaded, and Kaitlyn noticed her lips turning purple. “You need to stay with me,” her friend said. A medic suggested Natalia might need sugar. Riley grabbed her a Coke, and she sipped on it, struggling to keep her eyes open. Then the police arrived and, with the tent filling, they ordered anyone who wasn’t hurt to leave. Before she did, Kaitlyn leaned down, pressed both hands against her friend’s face and reminded Natalia of her twin. “Think about Gianna,” she pleaded. “She’s been with you her entire life. She couldn’t do anything without you.” The gunfire sounded louder – closer – than before, and now Marie was trembling, sobbing, hyperventilating. She and Summer had inched down the fence line and taken refuge with six or seven others behind a dark Ford pickup near the church parking lot’s entrance. The police continued to order people in their direction, north up Giles Street, which left both girls convinced that a gunman was on foot, making his way toward them. A short, blond woman held them both in her arms, trying to calm Marie. “What’s your name?” she asked. “Where do you go to school?” Marie, though, could barely speak. Out in the road, pickup after pickup pulled up as victims were piled into the beds. “Where’s the nearest hospital?” the girls heard people yell. The injured who didn’t reach the trucks were brought to paramedics gathering behind the 16-year-olds in the parking lot. “Honey, don’t look over there,” the woman told them. “Don’t do that to yourself.” A group brought over another woman, who was wearing only pants and a blood-soaked bra. Her face ashen, she didn’t say a word. “Her husband was shot,” one of the men explained. The relentless sights of carnage only intensified Marie’s fear that here, huddled behind a truck, her life could end. She peered back down the road, still waiting for a man with a rifle to appear in the night. One block west, in the pyramid-shaped Luxor on the other side of the festival grounds, Shae and Delaney hid in a bathroom, worried about the same thing. Shae’s parents were in their car, speeding toward the Strip, but they had remained on the phone with her. Their siren blaring in the background, she could hear them coordinating with other investigators already responding to the rampage. “If it’s a male shooter, he’s not going to go into the women’s restroom,” Shae’s dad had told her, so when they raced into the Luxor, the girls found one on the first floor and locked themselves in a handicapped stall. Shae sat with her back against the wall, leaning down to watch the door. A woman burst through, shrieking. Shae’s heart pounded. Had someone chased the woman there? Was the shooter in the hotel? She waited, hoping a man’s feet wouldn’t follow. None did, but she feared that the woman’s hysterics could draw a gunman’s attention. “Should I try to calm her down?” she asked her dad. “You can try,” he said. Shae opened the stall door and told the woman, who had been separated from a sister and a friend, that her parents worked for the FBI. The best thing for all of them to do, Shae said, was to stay calm. The woman stopped screaming. “It’s going to be okay,” Shae said, and the teenager hoped that was true. Back in the white tent, a medic, hands quivering, struggled unsuccessfully to insert an IV into Natalia’s right arm. Her friends were gone, but still lingering in her mind were Kaitlyn’s last words about Gianna, her missing twin. The girls looked so much alike that, for years, most people could only tell them apart by the scar on Natalia’s knee from a bicycle accident. “Mirror images,” their parents called them, because Natalia was right-handed and Gianna was left-handed. Her sister had to be all right, Natalia thought. She had to be. Then a man in shorts, a white T-shirt and a reversed baseball cap walked up. Dean McAuley, a 46-year-old firefighter down from Washington state for the festival, had just helped carry a young woman about Natalia’s age into the tent, but the pulse he’d detected when he found her on the ground had already disappeared. McAuley couldn’t bring her back. Maybe, though, he could do something for Natalia. He took a torn piece of blue shirt and tied it around her forearm, revealing a vein for the IV. He asked where she’d been shot. On her back shoulder, she told him. McAuley searched for an exit wound but couldn’t find one. His stomach knotted. The risk of severe internal bleeding, McAuley knew, was enormous. He checked her heartbeat and felt it racing. Her body was compensating for the shock, he suspected, but what would happen when that wore off? Ten minutes – that’s how long McAuley thought he had to save her life. “I’ll be right back,” he said. “Keep your eyes on me.” The firefighter found someone coordinating care in the tent. Just outside, McAuley was told, ambulances had gathered to take people to the hospital. He returned to Natalia and asked if she could stand. Yes, she said. He held her hand with one of his and her IV bag with the other. “There will be an ambulance waiting for us,” he told Natalia. When they got outside, none remained. The sound of gunshots had subsided by then, but McAuley could still hear frantic chatter blaring over first responders’ radios. “Active shooter.” “Multiple shooters.” He helped Natalia shuffle across Giles Street and into the same parking lot where Marie and Summer were sheltering. McAuley lowered her onto a lawn chair behind a white SUV. “What can I do for you?” he asked, taking a knee in front of her. “I want to call my parents,” Natalia said. He dialed. Her dad, Mike Baca, picked up. McAuley explained who he was and that he was with his daughter, who had been shot. “Is she alive?” Mike asked. McAuley gave her the phone. She said she couldn’t feel her legs. “Just breathe,” Mike told her, before he and his wife headed for their car. After hanging up, McAuley saw an older man jogging toward an Audi parked behind them. Reluctantly, he agreed to take them to a hospital. McAuley helped Natalia inside. He ordered the driver to turn on his hazard lights, find an ambulance and chase it. The man did, blowing through red lights along the way. In the back seat, Natalia told McAuley that her left arm had gone numb. She was struggling to breathe. “Do you have dogs?” he asked. Natalia said she had two, Kosmo and Vdara, both Boston terriers. He took out his phone and showed her a picture of Molly, his 100-pound Great Pyrenees. McAuley’s other hand moved to her wrist. At any second, he knew, Natalia’s pulse could plummet. He scrolled through photos of his wife and 5-year-old son. “You have a beautiful family,” she said. He asked about hers. Did she have any siblings? A twin, she said, who’d also been at the concert. “Do you know where she is?” “No,” Natalia said. At last, they pulled up to Sunrise Hospital. McAuley found a wheelchair and eased her into it, and then began pushing it up a driveway toward the trauma bay. They could already hear the moans. “Close your eyes,” he told her. “Don’t look around.” Natalia stared down, and on the ground she saw an American flag bandanna, spotted with blood. Nearing the brightly lit entrance, Natalia raised her head. She saw doctors and nurses desperately trying to triage maimed, wailing arrivals being unloaded along the curb. She saw bodies in the beds of pickup trucks. “Please help,” came the cries. “Please help.” McAuley wheeled her past the sliding doors and through a wide corridor that staff members later called “the sea of blood.” She’d been shot in the back, McAuley explained to a nurse. She had no exit wound, he said, but appeared to be stable, at least for now. He looked at Natalia. “You’ll be fine,” McAuley said. “I’ll see you later.” She forced a smile. “Thank you,” she told him, before the firefighter ran back outside to help others. A nurse changed her IV and wrote something in marker – vital signs, she thought – on her forehead. “It’s really hard to breathe,” she said, but in a hospital that would treat 199 patients from the festival that night, nobody had time to care for her yet. One victim after another sped by atop gurneys, their wheels streaking a tile floor that had transformed from beige to red. The air smelled of iron. “Watch out. Watch out,” she heard. “Cardiac arrest,” she heard. Natalia thought about her sister. It was in this hospital where their lives had begun. Where Gianna had been born first, crying, and Natalia had come out a minute later, making no noise at all. Where the doctors had been forced to resuscitate her because she wasn’t breathing. Where the girls had gone home, together, after just four days in recovery, stronger than anyone expected. Natalia closed her eyes. “Talia!” she heard a voice call. She looked up, and there, atop another gurney, was her twin. “What happened?” asked Gianna, her left thigh bleeding from a bullet that had passed straight through it. Natalia motioned to her shoulder. “I love you,” Gianna said. “I love you,” her sister responded. — The Monday morning sunlight leaked through the shades and into hospital room 272, where Natalia had spent the night in intensive care. A brace was wrapped around her neck, and on her face, a clear tube fed oxygen into both nostrils. Hours earlier, another tube that drained air and blood seeping from her punctured lung had been shoved between two ribs as Natalia, screaming, clenched a nurse’s hand. The bullet, she would learn, had traveled the distance of four football fields, pierced her right shoulder blade and fragmented. Slivers of metal had scattered throughout her chest cavity, slitting the lung, but missing her arteries, her trachea, her heart. A larger chunk of shrapnel, however, had veered to the left after impact, burrowing beneath her skin and over her spine before it struck Natalia’s opposite shoulder blade, fracturing that one, too. A change in the bullet’s trajectory of just centimeters might have killed her, but here she was with her sister, who was lying on a recliner nearby, gauze wrapped around her left thigh. Now Natalia just wanted to sleep, so she closed her eyes. Then came a sound so clear in her mind that, for a moment, she swore it had to be real: gunshots. Before he killed himself in Room 32135 at Mandalay Bay, Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds, injuring at least 450 people for reasons that remain unknown. But the wounds from the worst mass shooting in modern American history weren’t only physical. Among the most traumatized was Marie. Even after she and Summer left the church parking lot and made it to the safety of their homes, Marie couldn’t shake a debilitating sense of dread. Too distraught to sleep alone, she asked her mother to lie in bed with her until morning. At 7:15, the 16-year-old’s phone buzzed with a text from Summer, who had just learned about the enormity of what they survived: “Omfg 50+ dead. I can’t believe this.” “Oh my god summer. I woke up crying so many times,” Marie texted back, unable to imagine going to school that day. But Shae, who’d gotten home at 4 a.m., had never considered not going. She knew her parents would work on the investigation all day, and she didn’t want to stay home alone. She’d be fine, Shae told herself. She put on leggings beneath a pink nightgown, because it was “Pajama Day” at Faith, and headed to school, where she walked into her first class and approached her British literature teacher. “I don’t have my homework because it’s in my car,” Shae said, explaining that it was still parked at the crime scene. “I’m really surprised that you’re even here,” her teacher replied.

Sign Up Shae joined her classmates in the high school gym for an impromptu assembly. “It’s not the ideal way to start homecoming week,” Dan Buikema, Faith’s guidance director, told the 1,100 students, who listened in silence. He updated them on Natalia and Gianna but said he knew the massacre’s impact on Faith would extend well beyond the twins. The school was still trying to determine the number of students who had attended the concert, eventually counting 10. The youngest, an eighth-grader, had tripped on a body while fleeing with her mother and was left covered in blood. There were at least 17 more Faith students who had family or nonschool friends at the festival, and several were close to someone hurt or killed. “We’ve seen this kind of stuff happen around the world,” Buikema continued. “We’ve not seen this happen in our community.” Their community was Summerlin, a 35-square-mile collection of palm-tree-lined golf courses, $600,000-plus homes and augustly named neighborhoods: Reverence and the Summit, Affinity and Chardonnay. “The Summerlin Bubble,” people sometimes called it, and at the center was Faith, one of Nevada’s most highly regarded schools. At nearly $12,000 a year, Faith Lutheran Middle School and High School offered sixth- to 12th-graders the opportunity to pursue an array of interests, from programming drones to producing films to climbing rock faces. Its campus of red-brick buildings, which included two gymnasiums and a 772-seat performing arts center, looked like a university. Every 2017 graduate, the school advertised, had gone on to attend college. Faith didn’t try to shelter its students from people who were suffering – groups traveled on mission trips every year – but they knew that theirs was a world of privilege and comfort. Now, in the gym, a teacher played guitar, leading the assembly in a hymn. “All the earth rejoice. He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,” sang students sitting on the bleachers around Shae, who wanted to join but just couldn’t get the words out. It struck Shae in her next class that, somehow, she’d never cleaned the scrapes on her knees from the night before. She went to the nurse’s office, raising her nightgown and leggings to wipe away bits of asphalt embedded in her shins. Marie pulled into Faith’s parking lot Tuesday morning and saw what she’d seen every morning for years: other kids, walking, talking, laughing. She began to sob. Marie used to be one of them, she thought, doing and saying normal things, believing everything was okay. But now nothing felt OK. Marie hurried to her first class, AP English, and immediately had to leave. “I don’t know if I can do this,” Marie texted her mother. A day earlier, the teenager had spent hours at home watching news coverage of the shooting on TV. In her next class, the teacher, who hadn’t been told that Marie was at the festival, asked whether she could stay after school to take a test she’d missed. Suddenly, Marie was stricken with the sense that everything she’d cared about most – grades, the SAT, admittance into a top-tier college with an equestrian program – didn’t matter. “No,” she said. “I can’t take it after school.” Later, in a hallway, she and Summer talked about what was happening to them. “It feels so weird walking around,” Marie said. “It feels like we’re different,” Summer said. Nothing left the girls more convinced of that than how they reacted to noises. The roar of a motorcycle sent Summer sprinting to her front door. “What’s wrong?” her mother asked. “I don’t know,” Summer responded. Marie couldn’t stand a classmate zipping an eraser stick in and out, and in her living room on Tuesday night, the sound of a slamming door terrified her. Marie’s ears rang. She shrieked. Her mother, Susan, rushed in from the kitchen. For 15 minutes, she watched her daughter weep. Later that evening, Marie noticed someone parked across the street in their cul-de-sac. She checked every lock and closed every shutter. She set the alarm. When she got up to her bedroom, though, Marie realized her phone charger was still downstairs. She woke up her mom. “I need you to come with me,” Marie said. When they walked back down, the car was gone. She didn’t understand. If it had pulled away, she would have heard it. Marie insisted she had seen someone. But now came a more unsettling possibility. Maybe, Marie thought, it had all been in her mind. Shae sat on the ground outside her class, considering the right words to say as a camera was positioned in front of her. She’d been asked to describe her experience for a video the school planned to show during that week’s chapel services. Shae wore a long-sleeve plaid shirt and her hair in braided pigtails because it was Faith’s “Wilderness Explorer Day” in honor of the Disney movie “Up,” the theme for homecoming. “I know that I got out of that situation because God was with us, and I definitely know that He’s still with me now,” she said in the interview. “I have moments in the day that I really just feel a struggle, and I just feel like I can’t – like I just want to hole up in myself and not deal with any of it, but I know that I can’t do that.” Shae had never not dealt with things. She was an honor-roll regular and editor in chief of the Crusader Chronicle, Faith’s student newspaper. In third grade, her mother recalled, Shae came home one day complaining that the other kids didn’t take their assignments seriously enough. She labored to stay composed all week and tried to help Delaney, who’d hidden with her in the Luxor restroom, do the same. When she was asked to write a first-person account for the Chronicle about their escape, Shae gave it this headline: “I’m not a victim, I’m a survivor.” She couldn’t bear to watch, though, when a teacher played a TV interview with Natalia and Gianna in class that included clips of the bloodshed. As Shae looked down at her desk, she noticed classmates staring. “Shae, stop reliving it,” whispered a friend sitting next to her. In a chapel service, when a student yelled at the speaker, she clutched the arms on her chair and sat up, panicked. “I need to get out of here,” Shae thought, before a friend told her that it was part of the presentation. She left school early one afternoon to be with her mother, who had worked on the investigation most of the week but wanted to take Shae to get a manicure. Elena sat on their couch, and Shae laid her head on her mom’s lap for a few minutes before they headed to the nail salon. “How are you?” Elena asked in the car. “Everyone keeps telling me that I’m so strong,” she said, “but I just don’t feel strong right now.” Elena told her there was nothing wrong with that, and then they went inside the salon and Shae got her fingernails painted periwinkle blue to match a homecoming dress she no longer wanted to wear. It was Friday morning, the beginning of Natalia’s fifth day in the hospital, and a doctor had just pulled the chest tube out from between her ribs. All week, she and Gianna had been the focus of unrelenting attention. The twins had done interviews on “Good Morning America” and “Inside Edition.” They’d heard from producers for “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Dr. Phil.” ABC’s “20/20” had even flown Dean McAuley, the firefighter who had helped Natalia get to the hospital, back from Seattle to orchestrate an emotional on-camera reunion between the two. Amid all of it — the hundreds of messages on Facebook, the stream of well-wishers, the repeated questions about what it felt like to witness and face death — the twins remained unflinchingly positive. The online conspiracy theorists fixated on their smiles, insisting it was evidence that their stories weren’t true. But Natalia had been that way — “#keepsmiling,” she’d written next to a photo of herself in the hospital — since she was little. Her outlook was born of a compassion so deep that when she returned from a ninth-grade mission trip to Mexico, she announced to her parents that she wanted to become a traveling nurse, move to Africa and treat victims of Ebola. Twenty-two hours after being shot, still in the intensive care unit, Natalia wrote on Instagram: “I am so blessed to be alive at this moment of time.” Now, though, on Friday, the last of the TV cameras had left, and with them went the distractions. Natalia finally had time to consider what she might miss during her last homecoming weekend before graduation. With the chest tube out, she had only one question for her doctor: “Can I go to the football game tonight?” Two hours later, her sister rolled on an electric scooter through a tunnel of pompom-shaking cheerleaders and into the gymnasium, where hundreds of students gathered for a pep rally stood to applaud. “We would like to dedicate this assembly and the rest of our cheer season to Gianna and Natalia Baca,” a girl announced on a microphone. Then the cheer team performed, and the lip sync competition began. The freshmen went first, followed by the sophomores and juniors and, at last, the seniors. Between songs, the narrators recounted highlights of “our Faith Lutheran adventure”: the first dances and dates, cars and crushes. Natalia knew the entire lip-sync routine and had so looked forward to performing with her classmates one more time, to hitting her mark as the seniors romped to the final song, “We’re All in This Together.” Instead, she watched on FaceTime from her hospital room, blowing into a deep-breathing device, hoping that her lung wouldn’t collapse so that, maybe, she could make the football game. — The prayer had been said and the moment of silence had been held, and now, between the stadium’s bleachers, teenagers lining a pathway held up their phones, ready to record. Faith’s high school principal, Scott Fogo, waved up at the public-address booth and then pointed at who was behind him: Gianna, driving her scooter, and Natalia, less than five hours removed from the hospital, in a wheelchair being pushed by their dad. “Ladies and gentlemen, will you direct your attention to the 35-yard line,” the announcer said over the loudspeaker, his voice rising. “Welcome back Natalia and Gianna Baca.” The crowd stood and clapped as Faith’s cheerleaders surrounded the girls. “We love you, Bacas!” they chanted in unison. The principal, eyes watery, watched from a few feet away. He wore a maroon T-shirt that on the front showed an image of the girls above the hashtag #BacaStrong and on the back included a verse from 2 Corinthians about God’s comfort in times of trouble. Fogo, bald, bespectacled and known among students for his reassuring hugs, had given out more of them that week than any other in his career. He and his staff had done all they could think of – bringing in comfort dogs, calling traumatized students at home when they missed classes, prepping teachers for the inevitable questions and breakdowns, arranging for three counselors to attend the dance, just in case. “I don’t know what I say to my kid,” parents had told Fogo, so he helped set up a meeting for them with a Harvard-trained psychiatrist. He had even researched the aftermath of the Columbine High School rampage and discovered that a student who’d witnessed the violence hanged himself a year later. By Friday, he and Faith’s counselors had already begun to work on a plan for the months ahead, when they knew things would return to normal for many in the community but might not — then, or ever — for at least 10 of their kids. Fogo waited as Natalia’s dad parked her wheelchair next to Gianna. The twins faced the cheer team they co-captained, and in front of Natalia were the personalized black boxes that the girls stood on during games. Neatly stacked on top of hers was a megaphone and two gold pompoms. “Natalia,” it read. “Varsity Cheer 2018.” A tear tumbled down her cheek, and when the local TV journalists noticed it, they crept closer and pointed their lenses. Then out came the microphones, and back came her smile. “I haven’t seen a big crowd in, like, a week, so it was very overwhelming,” she told the reporters. “This school is family to me, so I didn’t want to miss it.” They backed away, and she eased out of the wheelchair. “Go, Crusaders! Go!” her teammates shouted. She leaned against the fence behind her, lightly bouncing one foot to the rhythm and tapping her hands together. Natalia knew she would never cheer at another football game. “Go, Crusaders. Go,” she mouthed in silence as her smile disappeared. Beyond the end zone, Shae and Delaney had just come into the stadium, both wearing #BacaStrong shirts. They walked toward the far side of the field to watch friends on the dance team, the two of them holding hands, just as the girls had done five nights earlier when they fled the concert. “I just don’t want to lose her in the crowd,” Delaney said. A dark-haired classmate in a polo shirt stopped to give Shae a hug. He’d heard she was at the festival. “That’s crazy. You’re okay, though, right?” the teen asked Shae, who, to him, looked no different. “Yeah,” she said and nodded, because the real answer was too hard to explain. Shae and Delaney spotted Summer. She’d come without Marie, who had finally made it through a day of classes but decided not to attend the game or any of the homecoming weekend activities. The girls compared how they were feeling. “I’m actually good today because I didn’t go to school,” Summer said. Delaney thought she’d made progress, too. “I only cried once,” she said. “Guys, I took off my bracelet,” Summer told them, referring to the purple Route 91 Harvest band. “I need to take mine off,” Shae responded. “I’m leaving it on,” Delaney said. “Even for tomorrow?” Summer asked, referring to the dance. “It’s kind of a constant reminder.” “It’s just like a — I’m lucky. I was lucky,” Delaney said. “It doesn’t make me sad anymore.” Shae, glancing down at her left wrist, said nothing. Natalia limped over the curb onto the sidewalk, and as the fading sunlight cut through the palm trees on Saturday evening, her iridescent white dress flashed shades of pink and blue, just as she’d imagined. But Natalia, one hand holding Gianna’s and the other squeezing her phone, didn’t seem to notice. It was just past 5 p.m., and they were waiting on the sprawling lawn outside the JW Marriott to get their homecoming photos taken, along with dozens of other Faith teens. Two local stylists had done their hair free at home, and a friend had bought them flats, because neither twin could stand in heels. The sisters had already decided to skip the dance. “There’s loud music. I don’t want to go,” Natalia had told her mom, and Gianna agreed. Still, both girls wanted pictures. Now Natalia checked her phone for the third time. Parker, the teen who’d asked her to homecoming, was running late. “Where’s your date?” asked Gianna’s boyfriend. “He’s coming at 5:30,” she said, but at 5:30, he still hadn’t arrived. Another parent walked over to say hello. “Both of you are here?” she said to the girls, surprised. “Where are your dates?” “Parker’s coming,” Natalia said. She checked her phone again. “He’s got 2 minutes,” someone announced at 5:43. One minute later, he made it. She grinned, and they shared a gentle embrace. He slipped a white rose corsage on her left wrist, and she held the matching boutonniere up to his navy blue lapel. “I’m just going to act like I’m doing it,” she said, laughing. Now they needed to get a portrait, so she motioned for him to shiftto her left. “I can move this arm,” Natalia said. From the camera’s view, she looked like any other girl, hair curled, eyelashes long, makeup pristine. The dress’s open back, though, revealed a patch of ivory bandages, the only evidence that the bones in her shoulders were fractured, that her chest was littered with bullet fragments. Parker put his arm around her, smiling as he searched for a spot to rest his hand. They posed with Gianna and her boyfriend and, later, a few other classmates. Then Natalia hugged her date goodbye and shuffled toward an awaiting truck. “Six o’clock. Take your pill,” a family friend said, because it was time for her painkiller. The woman helped her into the back seat, and 51 minutes after it began, Natalia’s homecoming ended. Across town, Shae was at Delaney’s house, struggling to find the right expression for their pictures. None of them felt quite right. “What’s wrong with us?” Shae asked, especially frustrated because 2016’s homecoming had cemented their friendship. Both had just come out of serious relationships and bonded over silly, finger-on-their-chin poses and a long night on the dance floor. When Brevin, the boy taking Shae, arrived, the girls got into the back of his family’s Ford Mustang. With their dates up front, Shae and Delaney took selfies together, and the night finally started to feel the way it was supposed to. The four of them had gone out in the same car, with the top down, on the night Brevin asked Shae to the dance. On the way, the girls had begged him to play country music, and he’d refused, and they’d all laughed about it ever since. Now, on the way to homecoming, he asked if they wanted to hear country music. Not tonight, the girls told him. They pulled up to the school and spotted Fogo, who was welcoming students. Shae and Delaney walked straight to the principal and hugged him, together. At a table in the cafeteria, the girls ate chicken and salad with their dates and talked about the decorations inside the gym. Shae had helped set up everything until midnight Friday and then again Saturday morning. “Wait till you see it,” she told Delaney. “It’s really pretty.” Shae had worried all week that she and her classmates wouldn’t enjoy the dance, but she’d invested so much of herself to make sure they did – covering the bleachers in black tarp, assembling light towers wrapped in linen, putting together a gazebo threaded in faux ivy around the dessert table, painting a miniature house that looked just like the one that floats away in the movie “Up.” On their way out of the cafeteria, the girls ran into Summer and exchanged hugs and compliments about their dresses. “I’m just going to warn you guys, there are a lot of balloons in there,” said Shae, who knew that, a day earlier, one had popped just as Delaney walked into the gym and she’d ducked to cover her head. But her best friend was too excited to worry about that, so Shae, Delaney and their dates headed across the courtyard. Reading this on your iPhone or iPad?

The rap song “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” thudded from the speakers as they walked through the gym’s double doors, where hundreds of students were bouncing in the dark beneath white ceiling drapes. The four of them passed white-clothed tables decorated with white rose petals and Mason jars filled with white lights that looked like fireflies. They sat on a bench along the side of the gym, and Shae took off her floral Steve Madden heels. Hand in hand, the girls approached the dance floor, maneuvering along the edge, outside the scrum. They found friends near the front, below the DJ booth, and began to dance. “Stanky Legg” came on, and the students roared. Delaney, beaming, let go of Shae’s hand. The bass boomed louder. The crowd grew larger. Shae felt her chest tighten. “I’ll be back,” she told a friend standing next to her. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yeah, I just need a minute,” she said, slipping away before Delaney could notice. Shae went to the principal. “It’s a little overwhelming,” she said, and he told her to take a break if she needed to. Shae picked up her phone and rushed toward the doors, fleeing beneath an arch of rainbow-colored balloons on her way out. On the far side of the courtyard, she stood barefoot along the edge of the sidewalk, her pink toenails buried in the grass. A string of lights between two poles hung overhead, illuminating the scrapes on her legs that still hadn’t healed. She called her dad. “I just can’t have fun,” Shae told him, her voice faltering. “I want to, but I can’t.” When he’d finished assuring her that it was going to be okay and they’d hung up, she stepped away from the light. Then Shae sat down and wept. Natalia finished her strawberry ice cream with gummy bears and watched an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” before she headed to her bedroom. Crumpled in the corner was the poster Parker had brought to the school parking lot when he asked her to the dance, just before she and Gianna left for Route 91. “HOMECOMING,” it read. He’d gone that evening without her. She lay down and closed her eyes. Natalia normally slept in complete darkness but couldn’t do that anymore, so she left the door open and the lights above her mirror on. As she began to fall asleep, Natalia knew what was coming. A sound so clear that, each night, she had to tell herself it wasn’t real: gunshots.

Maybe that’s why he chose to cast non-actors in his latest directorial effort, “The 15:17 to Paris,” which recently released a dramatic new trailer worthy of its clunky title. Returning to ground he found fertile in 2016’s “Sully,” Eastwood depicts the true story of passengers on a French train who overtook an armed terrorist in 2015, preventing a potential mass shooting. Eastwood cast many of the real passengers to play themselves in the movie, including three Americans: Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, and Spencer Stone. In the trailer, the three off-duty soldier are joking around about European Coke cans when they suddenly hear shots fired. Filmed in dramatic slow motion, passengers run down the aisles as the butt of a rifle dangles menacingly from an anonymous hand. The trailer then jumps to scenes of the Americans’ military training, childhoods, and conversations pondering life’s greater purpose.  Supporting the newly minted actors are Jenna Fischer, Judy Greer, Ray Corasani, PJ Byrne, Tony Hale, and Thomas Lennon. Warner Bros. will release “The 15:17 to Paris” on February 9, 2018.

ABC “senior investigative correspondent” Brian Ross greeted Gen. Michael Flynn’s plea deal with Robert Mueller by claiming Flynn is “prepared to testify that President Trump, as a candidate, Donald Trump, ordered him — directed him to make contact with the Russians which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said to this point.” It was a nuclear explosion. Within minutes the stock market plunged 350 points. It quickly became clear that it was flat wrong. Later, ABC News added on the evening news what they disingenuously called a “clarification” – actually, Trump directed Flynn to contact the Russians after the election, which not only isn’t scandalous, it’s completely expected for a new president. After more uproar, they finally found it to be a “serious error” and suspended Ross for four weeks without pay. It’s a classic journalistic mistake to try and be first to report something before it’s verified. But in the Trump era, when liberals believe the president is a uniquely dangerous threat to America – even the world -- any news that could lead to speculation about Trump’s impeachment or resignation is like catnip. Journalists are prone to over-hype anything that could spell “The End.” This suspension might be an adequate punishment….if Ross hasn’t made a long line of whopper mistakes. Conservatives remember the movie-theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado in 2012 and how Ross came on in “breaking news” mode to announce there was a “Jim Holmes” on a list of Colorado Tea Party Patriots…as if that was a perfect starting point to find mass shooters. It wasn’t. But there are more. -- In 2001, Ross claimed the anthrax used in deadly attacks after 9/11 in Washington and New York was coated with bentonite, a chemical compound found only in biological weapons made by Saddam Hussein’s henchmen in Iraq. Former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer remembers “I explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong. Brian Ross went with it anyway -- and one week later issued a murky, hard to understand correction.” -- In the first month of the Iraq War in 2003, Ross reported Saddam’s cousin Ali Hassan Al Majid (or “Chemical Ali”) had been killed. Several media outlets forwarded that report. Six months later, U.S. officials announced they had him in custody. -- In 2006, Ross claimed Pakistani officials had arrested Matiur Rehman, an al-Qaeda explosives expert who kept an “official” list of terrorist recruits, and could lead to Osama bin Laden. Pakistanis denounced the report as ‘fictitious.” ABC consultant Alexis Debat had warned ABC it was not true a day after the report had initially been broadcast. -- Also in 2006, Ross breathlessly relayed that then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert was under FBI investigation for bribery in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. “Justice Department officials describe the 64-year-old Illinois Republican as very much in the mix of the corruption investigation.” This prompted the Justice Department to deny there was any federal probe of Hastert, who demanded a retraction and threatened to sue ABC. None of these whoppers ever led to any suspension of Ross, who’s been at ABC since 1994. His liberal colleagues have given him six Peabody Awards and six George Polk investigative reporting awards, so his reputation inside the network was apparently unscathed by his large errors. It’s a little bizarre these days that sexual harassers like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer are dumped abruptly, while Brian Williams has an hour-long nightly show on MSNBC and Brian Ross gets a slap on the wrist. These supposed guardians against “fake news” look like fact-mangling isn’t really a serious offense. Brian Ross should be fired.

He was 61. His death, after sustaining head injuries in a fall at his home, was announced on Twitter by his nephew Patrick Carney, the drummer for the Black Keys. Ralph and Patrick Carney collaborated on writing and recording “Bojack’s Theme” for the animated Netflix series “Bojack Horseman.” Mr. Carney emerged from Akron, Ohio, in the late 1970s as a member of Tin Huey, a band on the arty side of new wave, and became a busy studio musician. Although best known for playing saxophones of all sizes, his arsenal also included clarinet, trumpet, violin, harmonica, panpipes, keyboards, trombone, ukulele and banjo. “I try to play every instrument ever made,” he once told a television interviewer. His long list of studio credits reflects not a colorless sideman for hire but a versatile musician with a distinct sensibility: whimsical, rowdy, eclectic, wry, historically informed, sometimes spooky, sometimes absurd. He could make his saxophones honk, croon, cackle and lament. Mr. Waits often relied on Mr. Carney, beginning with his album “Rain Dogs” in 1985. He once described Mr. Carney as “guided by some other source of information,” adding, “He’s like a broken toy that works better than before it was broken.” Mr. Carney was born on Jan. 23, 1956, in Akron. His first instrument was banjo, which he began playing in junior high school. An entirely self-taught musician, he turned to saxophone at 15 and immersed himself in jazz, from traditional to avant-garde. Soon after finishing high school, Mr. Carney joined Tin Huey, a new wave band that stretched genre boundaries. It released an album on Warner Bros. in 1979, “Contents Dislodged During Shipment,” but had no hits and split up in the early 1980s. Tin Huey has convened occasional reunions, including the 1999 album “Disinformation.” Through the next decades, Mr. Carney’s playing was welcome at sessions for albums like “Mesopotamia” by the B-52’s, St. Vincent’s “St. Vincent,” the Black Keys’ “Attack and Release,” the Waitresses’ “Wasn’t Tomorrow Wonderful?” and “Case/Lang/Veirs,” by the singers Neko Case, K.D. Lang and Laura Veirs. He also provided music for spoken-word recordings by the writers William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and Kathy Acker. Mr. Carney’s albums as a leader included “Ralph Sounds” in 1997, “I Like You (a Lot)” in 1999, “This Is! Ralph Carney” in 2003 and “Seriously” by Ralph Carney’s Serious Jass Project, a swing-flavored group, in 2011. Other projects in which he was involved include the Oranj Symphonette, which specialized in the music of Henry Mancini. Three days after the mass shooting at a church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, Mr. Carney posted “Lament for Charleston,” a somber saxophone-chorale elegy, on his Bandcamp site The Kronos Quartet heard it and had him perform it with them. Mr. Carney’s music was also at home on animated television series for both children and adults, including “Encyclopedia” and “The Motion-Enhanced Chronodirectional Adventures of Romanov.” The director Laura Torell has been working on a documentary, “This Is Ralph Carney,”  for more than a decade. Mr. Carney is survived by his partner, Megan Hinchliffe; his daughter, Hedda Carney; and his brother, Jim. Mr. Carney did not claim lofty inspiration. “I just pick up an instrument and blow,” he told The Plain Dealer of Cleveland in 2003. “Especially if it’s a horn.” Advertisement",2017-12-27 16:17:02,"Ralph Carney, Saxophonist for Tom Waits and Many Others, Dies at 61",,1,http://nytimes.com
175,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/offtopic/~3/MzE8SpThjKo/ct-republicans-gun-background-checks-20171205-story.html,"WASHINGTON — Rare bipartisan consensus around legislation to improve the national background check system for gun purchases is in jeopardy after House Republicans linked the measure to a bill allowing gun owners to carry concealed weapons across state lines. The House is expected to vote and pass the combination bill Wednesday over the objections of House Democrats, who accused Republicans of ""trickery"" and ""sabotage"" in tying the background-checks bill to a concealed-carry measure that the National Rifle Association called its ""highest legislative priority."" In the Senate, Democrats have labeled the concealed-carry legislation a nonstarter, while key Senate Republicans cautioned that pairing the bills is a recipe for the demise of both. ""When you put them together it makes it harder for us to do what we can do, and can do now,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the Senate's No. 2 Republican and a co-author of the background checks legislation. ""I want to separate those two out, get the Fix NICS bill passed and hopefully save some lives."" The background-checks legislation, which forces federal agencies and incentivizes states to better report offenses that prohibit individuals from buying firearms, is the first gun bill in years to secure the support of Democrats, Republicans, gun-control advocates and the NRA. Bill authors credit its narrow focus - shoring up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS - for keeping together an otherwise unwieldy coalition of support. They caution against upsetting the balance by loading up the bill with other measures. ""When we were negotiating in a very bipartisan, good-faith way, the understanding was the NICS-fix bill would be considered on its own,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., an original co-sponsor of the bill. ""Combining them would be completely unwise and unacceptable, and everyone knows it."" But supporters of the House GOP effort say that the concealed-carry legislation is a logical complement to the background checks bill. ""Taken together, these two bills preserve and protect the rights guaranteed to us by the Second Amendment,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said Tuesday. ""I believe that both bills complement each other in keeping people safe."" Lawmakers began drafting legislation last month to improve reporting to the background check system after it emerged that the shooter in a deadly attack on a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, could have been prevented from buying guns if the military had reported a domestic violence charge to the NICS database. The background- checks effort has been more successful than a Democratic-led push to respond to the October mass shooting in Las Vegas with a ban on ""bump stocks"" - an add-on device that turns a semiautomatic weapon into an illegal, automatic one. The bump-stocks matter is largely on hold in Congress, as GOP lawmakers, under NRA pressure, defer to a new Justice Department effort launched Tuesday to ""clarify whether certain bump stock devices fall within that definition"" of ""machine gun,"" a prohibited category of firearm. The Senate Judiciary Committee is nonetheless expected to discuss bump stocks at a hearing Wednesday that is also slated as the official start to the Senate's debate about improving NICS reporting. Gun-control advocates urging along the Senate process are excoriating House Republicans for what they see as complicating the debate. ""Instead of doing what's right, Congress is attempting to do what the gun lobby wants them to do, which is to pass this concealed-carry reciprocity law,"" said Mark Kelly, who co-founded the gun-control group Giffords with his wife, former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who left the House after becoming a victim of gun violence in her home state of Arizona. Kelly said that he and Giffords are ""both offended and outraged that Republicans are trying to tie this bad piece of legislation to something that's trying to do something positive."" Giffords and the liberal-leaning litigation and policy organization Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit Monday against the Justice Department, alleging that the agency has failed to turn over documents showing how the gun lobby is attempting to influence federal firearms policy, including by pushing concealed-carry reciprocity after the Las Vegas shooting. The Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit. Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the decision about how to package these bills has always been up to lawmakers. ""We support both bills, and if they get combined we'll support the combined bill - and if they're not combined we'll support both bills separately,"" Keane said. ""They're both good bills and they both should pass, and Americans should be allowed to exercise their constitutional right."" NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker applauded the House for being ""on the eve of voting for the biggest expansion of self-defense rights in modern American history."" But some Democrats in the Senate are shrugging off the House's maneuver as an empty threat - both because of Cornyn's resistance and because by their count, only a handful of Senate Democrats might possibly vote for concealed-carry legislation. It would take the support of eight Democrats, in addition to every Senate Republican, to clear the 60-vote procedural hurdles a gun bill would face. ""I don't think it changes anybody's vote,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a lead author of the background-checks bill. ""I don't think the votes are there in the Senate to pass concealed carry.""

Snyder’s We Are All Newtown. Begg was a first responder when—five years ago today—a gunman took the lives of 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School. “I want to recognize the valiant efforts of the first responders,” Begg continues, “and the families whose loved ones actually made it to the ER….We all tried our best.” Snyder’s three-film series follows doctors with mass-shooting experience who are “investigating the issue of gun violence as one of a public health crisis,” Snyder told The Atlantic. “We have heard the rising voices of emergency health workers who are on the front lines of gun violence each day. They are the ones who spend sleepless nights replaying moments of trying to stop bleeds and informing loved ones in waiting rooms about the suicides, homicides, and mass shootings that make up the nearly 34,000 gun deaths each year. They are also often in the best positions to analyze how many of these deaths might be preventable, informed by increased research and policy reform.” After responding to each respective mass shooting, many of the doctors featured in the film formed attachments to patients and victims’ families. “In my experience, these doctors are stoic and heroic voices in this struggle to keep Americans safe,” Snyder said.

178,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/guns-nonfatal-shooting-newtown-las-vegas/548372/,"Why? Because there's very little known about the thousands of victims who survive deadly shootings. The massacre in Las Vegas this October earned a macabre superlative: the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, with 58 innocents killed and more than 500 injured. The outpouring of attention and support was swift and far-reaching. CNN published portraits of all 58 victims. A man from Chicago made 58 crosses to honor the fallen. Zappos offered to help pay for the 58 funerals. An anonymous man even paid for 58 strangers’ dinners in memory of those who died. But what about the hundreds who were shot but didn’t die? A 28-year-old woman who was shot in the head at the concert is undergoing aggressive rehab after spending nearly two months in the hospital. A 41-year-old man is learning how to drive with his hands after he was paralyzed from the waist down. And many victims have relied on money raised through GoFundMe to support their medical care. The hardships facing those gravely injured in Las Vegas represent a horrific microcosm of gun violence in America generally—horrible deaths provoke widespread reaction, while the wounds of many multiples more take their toll largely unnoticed, unnumbered, and unstudied. Fatal gun violence is often categorized in ways that make it easy to track and study. That’s how researchers know that the murder rate in the United States has declined steadily over the past three decades. But what about gun violence that does not result in death? That is far trickier to measure. That’s because nonfatal gun violence has mostly been ignored. As a result, policy makers, law-enforcement officials, public-health experts, urban planners, and economists are all basing their work on information that is unproven or incomplete. Without more data—without identifying who commits shootings, where, how, and against whom; without plotting their rise and fall, to correlate with potential contributing factors; without analyzing those questions on a national, regional, local, neighborhood, and individual basis—it’s impossible to tell which public policies and interventions could be most effective at reducing gun violence. At least one recent study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, suggests nonfatal shootings have actually risen since the early 2000s. Based on what data does exist, they appear to constitute, by far, the largest portion of the country’s gun violence: Six out of every seven people who suffer a gunshot wound survive (excluding suicide attempts). Most of these injuries aren’t the result of mass-casualty events like the wrenching violence in Las Vegas or last month’s church massacre in Sutherland Springs, Texas; instead, they are the product of equally tragic incidents largely hidden from view. “This country has a real challenge—an epidemic of firearm injury,” said Sandro Galea, the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health. He co-authored the Journal study with a team led by Bindu Kalesan, the director of the Center for Clinical Translational Epidemiology and Comparative Effectiveness Research at Boston University. “There’s a gulf of understanding on this issue,” Galea said. Richard Aborn, the president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, agreed. “Nobody’s ever focused on this,” he said. “That impedes us from understanding the gun-violence problem—and other, related activity.” Largely ignoring nonfatal shootings means that Americans are both vastly underestimating and misunderstanding gun violence. Underestimating, because researchers are only barely beginning to measure the personal, familial, local, and societal costs of what Kalesan and others estimate are more than a million shooting survivors living in the United States; and misunderstanding, because nonfatal shootings can be quite different from those that result in death. The dearth of research makes it near impossible to fully illustrate the realities of gun violence to the broader public. As of now, for example, nobody really knows how often people are shot by their intimate partners, how many victims are intended targets or bystanders, how many shootings are in self-defense, how such incidents affect community investment and property values, or how much it costs taxpayers to care for victims. In order to come up with their estimate of a million shooting survivors, Kalesan and her colleagues had to rely on imperfect data from hospital emergency-room reports. As a result, survivors of gun violence are largely invisible, even to the people who work closely on the issue—including policy makers, academics, and medical professionals. According to Thomas Weiser, an associate professor of surgery at Stanford University Medical Center, Americans unwittingly turn a blind eye to gunshot victims’ medical needs, economic hardships, capacity for work, and ability to socially integrate. “We know very little about [gunshot]-trauma patients after they leave the hospital,” Weiser said. Weiser warned Sarabeth Spitzer, a third-year medical student at Stanford University, that nonfatal gunshot injuries might be a bad research topic. Weiser told her that a combination of poor foresight, neglect, and a deliberate choking-off of funds had left the field with virtually no data and no analysis to work from. Plus, as with all gun-related matters, it’s a minefield of controversy, which can severely limit access to grants and other funding. But Spitzer, a child of post-Columbine America, said the topic seemed a natural fit to her: For one thing, she intends to become a trauma surgeon. So she lobbied the university to help. Lucky for her, Stanford was willing to pay for a detailed national database of hospital care and payment data, which is why researchers now know, from a paper Weiser and Spitzer published in April, a great deal more about the costs of hospitalization for gunshot victims. “We took a straightforward question—of cost data and insurance—that remarkably didn’t have an answer,” Weiser said. Their study found over $700 million dollars a year just in post-emergency-room hospitalization costs—borne primarily by Medicaid and other government sources, or by victims themselves. Just 21 percent of the gunshot patients had private insurance. These costs can be filed under what Aborn calls the “closet consequences of nonfatal shootings.” They are not insubstantial. Another paper prepared by Kalesan and her team, which is still under peer review, finds that the hospital readmission rate for gun injuries is higher than for automobile accidents. Other research reveals that victims of nonfatal shootings are quietly carrying enormous physical and psychological burdens. Kalesan has been interviewing gunshot survivors for a study on the long-term effects on both the wounded and their families. One of her subjects, a woman who was shot in the arm during a workplace incident 15 years ago, recently told Kalesan, “I’m still waiting for my old self to come back.” Another man was shot in the head while standing in the street; he has a traumatic brain injury and can speak only three words. His mother cares for him full-time; they live on $650 a month in government benefits. At the University of Toronto, Jooyoung Lee is working on a similar project, writing a book based on his research tracking shooting victims in Philadelphia. Lee has observed, particularly among those shot by hollow-point bullets, that recurring pain can drive shooting victims to opioid addiction. That, in turn, can push them into dangerous situations and risky behavior as they try to feed their habit, which can lead to more trauma, incarceration, or medical intervention—all of which only compound a single gunshot’s effect on an overburdened health-care and criminal-justice system. Kareem Nelson, the founder of Wheelchairs Against Guns in New York City, a nonprofit aimed at protecting kids from bullying, gangs, and gun violence, speaks of the tremendous strain on caregivers, most often mothers and grandmothers with limited time and resources. “Families are already struggling” in neighborhoods with gun violence, he said. “So, when a child gets shot, a mother has to go through hoops. It’s really, really hard.” Again, a single gunshot’s effect is compounded, especially when both victim and caretaker are removed from the job force and stripped of their economic productivity. Some initial research is also starting to assess the effects that all shootings—not just homicides—have on neighborhoods, from economic development to property values to the quality of life for those who live there. “There” means places such as Mosby Court in Richmond, Virginia, and Copeland Street in Boston’s Roxbury neighborhood. From outward appearances, the two seem more different than they really are. Mosby Court is a low, sprawling public-housing development, with wide streets and lines of laundry drying in the afternoon sun. Copeland Street’s aging four-floor-walkup apartment buildings and three-level converted condos squeeze next to one another, casting shadows on foreboding entryways. But they are kindred communities. In early April, each neighborhood suffered the nonfatal shooting of a young black child innocently walking in their neighborhood: a 7-year-old girl in Richmond, a 6-year-old boy in Boston. “In the summer, we all sit out here enjoying the weather,” said Kieth Miller, who was sitting on the gray steps of his Copeland Street building, the same building where that 6-year-old boy lives. But the stoops and a park on the street were empty on that sunny April weekday afternoon. The shooting had occurred a few days earlier, as the boy walked to the corner store with his father, the intended target. “Nobody wants to be out now,” Miller said. This is the gun violence Donald Trump bemoaned during his presidential campaign—he framed it, as many Americans do, as a problem exclusive to black communities. African American parents, he said, “have a right to walk down the street of your city without having your child or yourself shot.” But it is a sentiment that runs counter to available data: Kalesan’s study, covering 2001 to 2013, shows nonfatal-assault victimization rates declined among African Americans and increased significantly for whites. The likelihood of a white person getting shot by an assailant and surviving rose 40 percent over those 12 years, while the likelihood for black Americans remained fairly steady; fatal shootings declined slightly for both races over that time. If they so choose, Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have an opportunity to push forward a major project to close the data gap and potentially inform evidence-based approaches to gun violence: the Panel on Modernizing the Nation’s Crime Statistics. Assembled by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, at the request of the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the panel issued a book-length report last year on the need to change current crime definitions and classifications. It highlighted nonfatal shootings as a priority. “The nation as a whole lacks reliable measures of shootings,” the authors wrote. The second part of the report, with specific recommendations, is expected to be published next year. But the research community fears the likelihood of its implementation has declined drastically with the departure of the more supportive Obama administration. Those fears grew when FBI Director James Comey, a key cheerleader for the crime-statistics effort, was fired in May. Current FBI Director Christopher Wray did not respond to inquiries about the project. Nor did the White House press office. But the researchers I spoke to see the president and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, as disinterested in numbers-driven approaches to crime and violence. Their fears are grounded in the administration’s hostility to data and evidence-based policymaking on everything from climate change, to the effects of voter-ID laws, to animal welfare. Perhaps the most analogous example is the National Commission on Forensic Science, which was established by the Obama administration to advise the Justice Department on the best use and practices of DNA, ballistics, and other forensic sciences in solving and prosecuting cases. The commission was developing uniform standards for forensic testimony, but Sessions discontinued the body, and its plan for forensic standards, in early April. “If you had asked me three years ago, I would have been more optimistic,” Janet Lauritsen, a professor at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, and the panel’s chair, said. Now? Well: “You have to have an appreciation for facts and a budget to implement it.” The roots of the gun-research problem go back nearly 100 years. In 1929, when federal law-enforcement officials unveiled the country’s first standardized method of tracking crimes, they divided assaults into just two categories in the inaugural Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook: simple (usually a misdemeanor) and aggravated (often a felony). Serious urban crime plagued cities, but it was a wholly different time. On the one hand, it was the year of the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre in Chicago, when gangsters associated with Al Capone killed seven men, five of whom were members of a rival gang; on the other hand, the UCR handbook explained that shooting at or into trains should not count as a violent crime because “they are usually offenses of malicious mischief by children.” Because of the widespread adoption of the UCR’s criteria, police departments to this day fail to report shootings as separate, countable crime statistics; instead, an unknown number of shootings are lumped in with all the other aggravated assaults, like stabbings, pool-cue beatings, or attacks with a bat. “The shooting data has been problematic from the start, and that’s because of this aggravated-assault category,” Lauritsen said. “That legacy has been around for 90 years.” Newer reporting systems—gathered through law-enforcement associations, victim surveys, health-care providers, and independent organizations such as the Gun Violence Archive—have all published useful data, but each is operating piecemeal. Taken together, these data collections don’t come close to a complete and direct accounting of gun violence—unlike, say, incidents of cancer, which are rigorously tracked with robust federal funding. The study Kalesan and her colleagues published earlier this year in the American Journal of Epidemiology concluded that nonfatal gun violence was rising as of 2012. They used data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, a network created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Consumer Product Safety Commission that relies on a sampling of hospital emergency-room reports. However, the study’s findings aren’t infallible. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System has been criticized as incomplete for how its data is compiled—changing the specific hospitals sampled and not accounting for shooting causes that are reported as “unknown.” A few months after the study’s publication, a rebuttal appeared in the Journal from researchers at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy and the University of California, Davis. After adjusting for purported flaws in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, they found that the rate of nonfatal shooting assaults rose for a few years starting in 2003, but then declined to almost exactly where it started. This much is certain: Nonfatal shooting assaults are a major, persistent public-health problem. And without more thorough data collection on gunshot victims, the information that’s available to the public will be imperfect at best—and deeply flawed at worst. Without modernized crime statistics, researchers simply cannot answer questions like: Who pulled the gun? Did he or she deliberately fire it? Who, if anyone, was struck? What happened to the victim? The case information collected by hospitals is not typically coded for any connections to the case information collected by law enforcement, so it’s almost impossible to match victims to any arrested perpetrators or seized firearms, which would yield a trove of useful data—criminal histories, relationships between victims and shooters, socioeconomic status, weapon types. Some police departments do carefully track shootings, but most keep that data internal. In New York City, for example, police track nonfatal shootings rigorously, Aborn said, starting from when victims walk into an emergency room with a gunshot wound. “We really like to unpack shootings,” he said. “It’s almost an epidemiology approach: understanding what’s causing the disease. Without that data, it’s very hard to do that kind of analysis.” But other cities can’t tell you how many people are shot in their own jurisdictions, said David Kennedy, the director of the National Network for Safe Communities at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. That includes many of the biggest cities in the country. When the Major Cities Chiefs Association routinely surveys its members for violent-crime data, only 40 of its 69 member agencies are usually able to provide the number of nonfatal shootings. And when The Baltimore Sun tried last year to compare lethality rates for shootings, it found that only half of the country’s 30 biggest cities even keep that data. Researchers and analysts tend to go where the data—and the funding—is. Over the years, that has meant looking at homicides, not at nonfatal shootings—because murders are sufficiently rare and well documented to provide reasonably comprehensive information. That gap widened after Congress passed the Dickey Amendment in 1996, which, along with accompanying budget cuts to the CDC, effectively took the federal government out of the business of funding gun research. Though it was ostensibly designed to prevent federal backing of biased anti-gun propaganda, the National Rifle Association-backed law has had a huge chilling effect: Since, academics found themselves with little hope of attracting funding, many of them steered clear of gun-violence research. Former President Barack Obama tried, with limited success, to reverse this course. He directed the CDC to resume financing the small amount of gun-related research that is allowable under the Dickey language, but little has happened. The money has mostly gone to maintaining the CDC’s database on fatalities. Nongovernmental research funding has made up some of the difference—but it tends to go to policy-oriented work in line with the funder’s mission or to splashier topics like mass shootings. Perhaps it’s not surprising then, given the barriers, that those few who do specialize in researching nonfatal shootings tend to be disproportionately passionate about the topic—which often translates into personal support for stricter gun-control measures. That makes them easy targets for gun-rights groups looking to attack them for bias. This past December, Doctors for Responsible Gun Control called for Kalesan to be fired, citing her social-media posts as evidence of anti-gun animus. Her co-author, Galea, was placed on a “watch list” of professors with a “radical agenda” for his gun-violence op-eds in The Boston Globe. Kalesan and Galea say they don’t have any financial conflicts of interests to disclose when they publish on gun control. Indeed, gun-control groups aren’t in the habit of funding research on a significant scale. Though they’ve tried to close some of the data gap—the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive, for example, now catalogues shooting victims through media and law-enforcement reports—they don’t have industry-sized piles of money to toss around. With limited resources, most organizations concentrate on lobbying for and against legislation rather than on funding research to undergird their arguments. Significant drives for federal gun-control legislation tend to come after widely publicized tragedies like the Pulse nightclub, Sandy Hook, and Gabby Giffords shootings. Indeed, Democrats resurrected their gun-control push immediately after Las Vegas and again after Sutherland Springs. To be sure, it may be politically savvy to push for reform when the nation appears to be united against gun violence. But the legislative measures most often put forward are things like assault-weapons bans and the use of terror watch lists for background checks. Those bills may resonate with many Americans, but they have no connection to the vast majority of shootings. Most gun violence is not a mass-media event. It takes place one shot at a time, on city streets and rural properties, with non-assault weapons, usually between people who know each other. A woman shot during the Las Vegas massacre may share similarities with one shot by her partner, but there are too many variables to treat both events as if they were the same—or as if regulation to prevent one kind of violence would likely stop the other. Most shootings also never result in an arrest, according to FBI assessments, but news-making mass shootings rarely go unsolved. Those perpetrators typically die or get arrested at the scene, or soon after. The hundreds who put bullets in other people every day, however, are far less likely to be apprehended. Unlike homicide cases, there are rarely elite detectives and prosecutors investigating nonfatal shootings, just overtaxed precinct detectives with little authority to commandeer the resources of patrol officers, crime-scene specialists, or testing labs. Worse, according to many advocates I spoke to, nonfatal shootings are too often viewed as occurring among criminals, drug dealers, and drug users—none of whom summon much sympathy from policy makers or law enforcement. What’s more, state resources to help those victims, including therapy, relocation assistance, and compensation funds, often go only to those who were not involved in the commission of a crime at the time of the shooting, like innocent bystanders. This effectively sends the message that those injured while engaging in a drug deal, carrying an unlicensed weapon, or starting a fistfight don’t deserve help. That’s a shame, Lee said, because that’s often exactly when both criminals and victims are most in need of the help those services provide. “A lot of times it’s a turning point in their life path,” he said. “By denying them funds, the state is essentially denying people those opportunities.” There is, Lee said, “a perception by police, by politicians, by health-care providers, that they are guilty in their own demise. That has a lot of implications on the care and treatment they can receive afterward.” Thea James was working in the Boston Medical Center trauma unit on Patriots’ Day in 2013 when Boston Marathon bombing victims arrived. James, the associate chief medical officer and the director of the Violence Intervention Advocacy Program, also had several young men freshly admitted from that weekend’s spate of gun violence. Her staff didn’t blanch when a bombing victim lashed out verbally at a nurse’s innocent cheery greeting. “We understand that is a manifestation of trauma,” James said. “But if one of my [shooting victims] said that, [nurses would] be calling public safety.” Instead of getting the help and sympathy that other victims of violence receive, black men in urban areas in particular are penalized, James said. When they act out, refuse to cooperate, or clash with people, authority figures yell at them, manhandle them, and further marginalize them. But “that’s not bad behavior—it’s a manifestation of their trauma,” James said. James’s program is one of more than 30 in a national network that provides help to shooting victims, from mental-health counseling to job-training programs. Most, like hers, are at urban trauma centers that see the bulk of a city’s shooting victims and where population density justifies their existence. Gunshot victims in rural areas rarely get such interventions. “We grab them while we have them, and we start developing a relationship with them,” she said. “They just have to say yes.” Three-quarters of them do, and accept some post-hospitalization assistance from the program. Some 175 shooting victims a year end up at Boston Medical Center, the Boston University-affiliated hospital in the city’s downtown, according to James. Almost all shooting victims will suffer some psychological trauma, James said, impairing their ability to navigate a life that, in most cases, was already difficult. It’s worth pausing to consider what this means. Each year in Boston, 200 or so people return home from the hospital after having been shot, adding their trauma to a small number of already troubled neighborhoods. And Boston is a relatively low-violence city. The national conversation on gun violence often includes mental health—but usually in the context of preventing the next mass-murder, not in ameliorating the daily struggles and stressors that are exacerbated in crowded, impoverished neighborhoods. Joao DePina, for example, believes that his brother, Michael DePina, would be alive if better mental-health interventions were available. Michael was shot to death at age 29 in 2014, in what Joao believes was the end of a back-and-forth set of shootings with a rival. On the surface, it fits into a 20-year narrative of retaliatory gun violence in Boston’s Cape Verdean community. But Joao, a longtime peace activist who is now running for city council, said it had more to do with long-standing mental-health problems stemming from Michael’s difficult childhood in the foster-care system. “He had a lot of anger and animosity,” he said. “He couldn’t control those things.” Reverend James Wilkins, a pastor in Richmond, understands. “My granddaughter survived but has a brain injury,” Wilkins said. She was 11 when she went outside to ride her scooter five years ago; she took a 40-caliber bullet to the back of the head. Now 17 years old, she doesn’t have the full use of some parts of her body, but she gets good grades and after working her first job earlier this year, she is focusing on her studies. Wilkins, a former street criminal who did time himself, saw a second tragedy in the man who shot his granddaughter—a 22-year-old just out of prison at the time. “He was in a dark place, crying out, with anger and pain,” he said. “I was one of those. I grew up in a prison household. The only role model you know is a man in jail telling you to hold down until he comes back.” “That 15-year-old kid who gets a gun and pulls the trigger,” Nelson said, “that’s a person who needs some help.” The National Network of Hospital-Based Violence Intervention Programs plans to develop a database from member programs like James’s to provide data on interventions and outcomes. If that data proves that James’s program works, perhaps she won’t have to keep scrambling for her $750,000 budget. Over the program’s 10 years, she has seen funding come and go from the city of Boston, a federal Shannon Grant, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the 2009 economic-stimulus fund, the Boston Public Health Commission, the Department of Justice, the Massachusetts state budget, and various private donors. A little farther south on the gray Boston University School of Medicine campus, Kalesan does her gun research in her spare time, off the clock from her day job running the Center for Clinical Translational Epidemiology and Comparative Effectiveness Research. Her hope of getting funding for her gun-related studies has turned to despair. “I trained to be a pharmaceutical trialist,” Kalesan said. When she did that work, funders “would hunt us down to give us money.” Lee is fortunate enough to have a book deal to write up the research he conducted over two years in Philadelphia, when he had a foundation-paid fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania and a small government grant. He has had more luck getting funded for his sociological studies of street rap than for his gun research. Nevertheless, bit by bit, they and others are contributing to a body of evidence that could help change how the country and its policy makers respond to gun violence. At the current pace, however, that will take many years—and many, many more victims. Enjoy unlimited access to The Atlantic.

        Jim Dalrymple II Posted on December 21, 2017, at 8:51 p.m. ET Stephen Paddock, right, and his brother Eric. Stephen Paddock, the gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history from his Las Vegas hotel room, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the mouth, according to a newly released coroner's report. Clark County announced Paddock's cause of death Thursday, describing it as suicide via ""an intraoral gunshot wound to the head."" All 58 people killed in the shooting died from gunshot wounds, the report said. Broken windows at Mandalay Bay where Stephen Paddock opened fire. The shooting occurred late on Oct. 1, when Paddock began firing from the window of his 32nd floor hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip. Paddock targeted a concert taking place across the street, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds of others.

181,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/horoscopes/~3/PpBt759sBZY/ct-john-conyers-son-20171205-story.html,"WASHINGTON — The son of Rep. John Conyers Jr. - the embattled congressman who announced his sudden retirement Tuesday - may be headed for his father's seat, carrying on a decades-long political dynasty in Michigan. Conyers, D-Mich., resigned Tuesday amid allegations of sexual harassment; in doing so, the erstwhile dean of the House endorsed his eldest son, John Conyers III, to take his place representing Michigan's 13th Congressional District, which includes Detroit. The younger Conyers has been one of his father's fiercest defenders as the 88-year-old faced increasing pressure from Democratic leaders to step aside when a growing number of female former aides accused him of mistreatment and unwanted advances. ""It's very unfortunate to see him fight so long for so many people and to automatically have the allegations assumed to be true,"" John Conyers III told reporters last week, according to NBC affiliate WDIV. ""And of course, with sexual assault, women are to be believed. But in this instance, he has no history of this. ""And I think that if we're not going to make [Sen.] Al Franken resign when we have evidence of him groping a woman while she was asleep . . . it's disconcerting to me to see the way my father is being treated after he's given so much to this country, not just for black people but for people alike."" Of his father, he added: ""He fights for everyone."" Here's what we know about John Conyers III. He lacks political experience. Conyers is 27 and from Detroit. He attended Morehouse College as well as New York University, according to his contributor bio on HuffPost. That bio, whose details The Washington Post has not yet confirmed, identifies Conyers as ""a partner at Detroit's first minority run hedge fund"" and ""a seasoned multi-discipline consultant who has provided fundraising and social media services to both political and business clients."" It also says he served as an intern in the Department of Community Outreach in the Israeli Embassy in Washington. ""John is committed to melding community engagement, entertainment and politics,"" the bio states. He caused public headaches for his father in 2010. In 2010, MLive.com reported that John Conyers III was cited for speeding in his father's Cadillac Escalade - or rather, the government-leased vehicle his father used as a member of Congress. There were also reports that year that the younger Conyers had driven the vehicle to a rap concert and that it was broken into, according to MLive.com. The then-20-year-old reported to police that two laptops had been stolen from the Cadillac, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of concert tickets. After the incident, the elder Conyers apologized. Conyers resigns from Congress amid harassment allegations, endorses son to succeed him ""I have just learned about the inappropriate use of a congressional vehicle by my son over the Thanksgiving holiday,"" he said in a statement at the time, according MLive.com. ""I am sorry it happened and will make sure that it does not happen again."" The Detroit Free Press reported that the congressman said he reimbursed the Treasury Department more than $5,600 for his son's unofficial use of taxpayer money. A photo on social media at the time showed his son in a Cadillac with a bottle of French champagne, according to an MLive.com article. The story's headline: ""The fabulous online life of John Conyers III, or why his family needs to do damage control immediately."" He's an opinionated writer. In a HuffPost op-ed, under the headline ""Orange Watergate: The Inevitable Impeachment of the 45th President,"" Conyers wrote that the ""reactionary and cavalier nature of the president will ultimately be his down fall. ""As his approval ratings tumble and confidence wanes, expect the weight of possible impeachment to make his already poor decision making worse. Self-preservation is ultimately the downfall of the narcissist."" In the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Conyers wrote that the national debate should be about gun control, not mental illness, explaining: ""I have dealt with Major Depressive Disorder since I was 15 years-old. I've not once thought about murder. I know right from wrong. ""My friends with bi-polar and depression and multiple personality disorder don't think about hurting others, if anything we think about hurting ourselves."" ""So if you grapple with mental illness do not let the medias stigmatization of our ailments make you self-conscious,"" he wrote in his October op-ed. ""As much as they love to make us their scapegoats, It's not our fault. You, as well as I, know we know right from wrong. When they need someone to blame they look to us first, when it's time to lend their hand to help us they're nowhere to be found."" He's a rapper. In a 2013 song, ""Rich Glorious,"" Conyers talked about his battles with the media amid his mother's 2012 bribery conviction, as well as the Cadillac mishap, according to Roll Call. ""Hey f - making a living, boy, I'm trying to make history. So picture me letting the news nitpick at me,"" Conyers said in the rap video, which showed an image from a news story about the incident. He's up against his cousin for the congressional seat State Sen. Ian Conyers, John Conyers Jr.'s great-nephew, told the New York Times that he intends to run as well in the special election.

          / CBS News It was Dec. 14, 2012, and Liza Long headed to work at Carrington College-Boise. It was just another Friday morning until Long, the mother of four children, logged on to Facebook, where news of a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, was just beginning to emerge. ""I just put my head down on my desk and started to cry,"" Long, 42, told CBS News. But it wasn't that Long knew any of the families that had lost a child. ""I had children about that age too. It's every mom's worst nightmare. But I realized right away it's every mom's worst nightmare on two fronts, not just one."" Her first thought, she later wrote, was ""What if my son does that someday?"" Only a day before Sandy Hook, Long had to forcibly restrain her second oldest son, Michael -- then 13 -- to prevent him from running out into oncoming traffic, and then had him transported to an acute care psychiatric hospital. The incident -- which left Long covered in bites and bruises from her son -- was hardly something new. For close to eight years, Long, then a single mother, and her other children had been coping with Michael's abrupt, violent behavior. (In writing and speaking out about her family's experience, she refers to her son as Michael, though that's not his real name.) These outbursts were so frequent and frightening that Long and her children worked with child protective services and together set up a protocol for how best cope and stay safe whenever Michael spiraled out of control -- when he bit, punched and screamed, or pulled knives and threatened to hurt or kill his mother and siblings.  The first police report  about an incident when Michael threatened them with a knife was written up when he wasn't even 10 years old. Michael never remembered the episodes after they occurred. ""We drilled on it like you might drill on a fire plan,"" said Long, who recently published her memoir, ""The Price of Silence: A Mom's Perspective on Mental Illness."" ""If my son became unpredictable and violent the younger children knew where to go. They'd go to the nearest place where they could lock the door. They'd grab their iPod or their books or something to color, head to the car and lock the door, or head to my room and lock the door, and my older son would call the police because in this country that's what you do."" Life was always unpredictable. Diagnosis after diagnosis and at least a dozen psychiatric drugs brought no relief. ""We had no idea whether a day would be a good day or a go-to-jail day,"" she said. The night of the Sandy Hook shooting, Long returned home and began to write an entry on her blog, ""The Anarchist Soccer Mom."" It was a call to action -- and also a call for help: Long had been telling her story anonymously for years, but this time she made the decision to put her name to the story. ""I live with a son who is mentally ill. I love my son. But he terrifies me,"" she wrote. The blog post went viral, generating more than a million 'likes' on Facebook and 30,000 email replies. While some families were offended and enraged, others contacted Long to share their own stories of coping with a loved one's mental illness. Many wrote to Long about frustrations with what she calls the ""school-to-prison pipeline,"" something she had experienced with her son over and over again. Decades ago, states started closing mental hospitals that warehoused the mentally ill without funding enough treatment alternatives. As a result, as Long wrote, ""It seems like the United States is using prison as the solution of choice for mentally ill people."" ""There are some things that we're doing right in this country but we need to do a better job across the board to provide better access to parents and kids to mental health care that works,"" she told CBS News. As a result of her blog post, an expert on bipolar disorder also reached out to Long. He told her that she had perfectly described an episode of bipolar disorder. Once again, Michael was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and this time diagnosed with bipolar disorder, type 1, which is defined by episodes of severe mood swings from mania to depression. He was put on lithium, which she says has helped greatly. However, Michael still has challenges, including a sensory processing disorder, executive function problems and dysgraphia, a learning disability that interferes with his ability to write, even though ""his I.Q. is off the charts,"" Long says. Long says her son has been stable and nonviolent for a year and a half since he started to receive the right treatment. She believes the mental health care system must move away from a symptom-based approach to treating mental illness often results in a wrong diagnosis or a succession of inadequate treatment efforts. That view is shared by Dr. Tom Insel, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), who explains that ""symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment."" He writes in his blog on the NIMH website that the health care system must get better at diagnosing and treating mental illness based on the latest research into its underlying biological causes. But until medical science advances that understanding further and the mental health care system gets greater support, families like Long's may continue to struggle -- something she says the parents of Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza also endured. ""I wanted people to understand that Nancy Lanza wasn't a monster and that her son -- and I know people don't like to hear this -- that her son was not a monster,"" said Long. ""He was a sick boy who needed help and she was a mom who tried to get him help, a dead mother judged by everyone who paid the ultimate price because of what I view as our broken mental health care system.""

184,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/Wtv0u1sgxDI/new-mexico-school-shooter-had-secret-life-on-pro-trump-white-supremacy-sites,"SEARCH For years before William Edward Atchison killed two students and himself, he lived a shadow life online—one full of crude alt-right memes and praise for school shooters. In real life, William Edward Atchison—people called him Bill—lived in a little yellow house with his parents, about a mile away from the Giant gas station where he worked and from Aztec High School, where he shot and killed two students and then himself last Thursday. At the murder scene, police found a thumb drive with a note that read, “If things go according to plan, today would be when I die. I go somewhere and gear up, then hold a class hostage and go apeshit, then blow my brains out.” He wrote “work sucks, school sucks, life sucks. I just want out of this shit.” “It’s a shame he wasn’t on our radar,” San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen told Fox News last week. “I don’t think he had anything so much as a traffic ticket.” And yet online, the 21-year-old New Mexico resident lived a prolific life as a white supremacist, pro-Trump meme peddler who was most known for his obsession with school shooters. For a half-decade, Atchison spent most of his days online, repeatedly posting threats of violence and cries for help. When users saw posts from Atchison, who went by dozens of names like “Adam Lanza” and “Future Mass Shooter” on both larger platforms like YouTube and racist communities like The Daily Stormer, they would often ask how his manifesto was going. Despite local law enforcement’s claims that he wasn’t a known threat, and a visit from the FBI in 2016, Atchison spent most of the last half-decade glorifying school shooters on alt-right websites and posting plaintive appeals for help in fixing his life, according to hundreds of posts analyzed by The Daily Beast. At EncyclopediaDramatica, a Wikipedia-style site for fringe internet users to describe memes and in-jokes in detail, he volunteered as a SysOp, the site’s word for an administrator. Atchison’s page, now replete with his screen name @satanicdruggie and his real identity, is filed under the “An Heroes” section, reserved for people who have killed themselves. On the alt-right forums and hate groups he frequented, Atchison appears to have made many enemies. Despite later becoming a moderator of the site, one of Atchison’s most popular EncyclopediaDramatica accounts, AlGore, was banned from the site for two years when it was labeled as a “troll.” And in the run-up to the 2016 election, EncyclopediaDramatica users excoriated Atchison for abusing his powers as a SysOp of the site. Users were upset he was appending too many pro-Columbine shooting memes and “shitty facebook commentaries” praising Donald Trump on the site’s home page. In the thread, as it often did with discussions about Atchison’s last account @satanicdruggie, the conversation invariably turned back to his obsession with school shootings. “Do you fantasize about shooting up the bullies at your school?” one user asked. “Yah i remember him literally bragging about being *obsessed* with Columbine,” a user responded. “In 2016.” “Have you completed your manifesto yet?” another asked. Atchison even spread his affinity for school shootings and Nazi ideology in more sanitized parts of the web. On Steam, an online video game store and community, Atchison used the reviews section to criticize Wolfenstein games, which are set in World War II-era Germany. “I find this game highly offensive for featuring mass murder against your own race,” he wrote. In another review, he simply wrote, “RIP Hitler.” In a review of Doom II, Atchison referred to the Columbine shooting as “LOLumbine.” His review for the game Hatred, a game which was initially pulled from Steam because the main character’s goal is to “slaughter innocents,” simply reads “ur going to ALL pay.” And his recent posts reflected what seems to be a migration from trolling to honest espousal of an extreme right-wing political ideology. In November, Atchison wrote on Steam, “How am I supposed to function in this world? Wherever I go, I see degeneracy. Pointless materialism, hedonism, sexual decay, dirty n**gers who do nothing but slowly break down this society etc. it’s fucking everywhere. No way to escape it, 99% of people are part of it and whatever I do I am confronted with the death of the West. Go to the store and buy groceries in peace? Nope, here’s a group of LGBT liberal filth in line with you. And there’s a n**ger family with 10 kids over there. And a Finn too, but he’s overweight as fuck and he’s buying alcohol and shit junk food. Fucking fantastic. “I used to think that this was a phase and we’d get over it, but I have now come to realize that I was born into a literal dystopia.” On Kiwi Farms, a forum that describes itself as a place for “gossip and exploitation of the mentally handicapped for amusement purposes,” Atchison frequently posted commemorations of mass shooters. Two days before his own school shooting, under his username “Fuck You,” Atchison posted an explicit sexual reply endorsing Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath, a failed mass shooter from Halifax, Nova Scotia. (Atchison used a photo of Kiwi Farms administrator Josh Moon as his profile picture for Steam.) On YouTube, Atchison admitted he posted anonymously on pro-Trump, white-supremacist sites like 4chan’s /pol/ board or The Daily Stormer, but gave up when domain registrars kept shutting down The Daily Stormer’s domain names. He, along with most of The Daily Stormer’s community, said the sites were “shoa’d,” an anti-Semitic slur. “[I’m] on different youtube channels, anonymous posts on the chans, or my work on ED,” he said. “Formerly DS before it got shoa’d and I’m too lazy to get TOR again﻿.” Atchison had also posted on Blockland.us, a forum for the Minecraft-like multiplayer video game, since 2014. His more than 40 usernames were meant to offend. Almost all were racist or violent by design. Several were modeled after school shooters, including Cho Seung-Hui, Omar Mateen, Adam Lanza, Elliot Rodger, and Anders Breivik. He also went by “School Shooter” and “Future Mass Shooter.” Ryan Lenz, who monitors hate groups and extremism for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Atchison’s pattern is typical of white extremists—even if his years-long archive of school-shooting proclamations might be unprecedented. “Generally, mass shooters spend a period of time prior to their action steeped in studying previous shooters. They study the aftermath of these individuals. They have a great deal of esteem or respect for others who have done the same,” said Lenz. “Add in the ideology, in this case these forums—it compounds the severity and the rate of radicalization.” Lenz said the cocktail of violent rhetoric, mental illness, and economic despair is what leads to “mobilization,” the word experts use for the shift from radicalized online rhetoric to real-life behavior. “What we’ve found with these ideologies is that they repeatedly lead to violence. There’s a dual line of radicalization happening,” said Lenz. “To steep yourself in Daily Stormer rhetoric and the sites like it is to put yourself in the headspace of where the violence is when not if.” In his final days, Atchison used “Sam Hyde” as his display name, the name alt-right users on websites like 4chan and Twitter employ in an effort to dupe the media into sharing false information after mass shootings. “The internet has changed a lot of things. Make it much easier for an alienated, isolated kid to find communities where they feel they belong,” said Lenz. “And it sometimes goes unchecked because of how the alt-right has presented itself: It’s just irony. It’s for the lulz.” On EncyclopediaDramatica, Atchison also appears on the entry for Bob8466, or Carter Boyles of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a 15-year-old who shot and killed himself at his high school on Sept. 11, 2016. Atchison, who called himself a friend of Boyles on YouTube and the video game site Steam, wrote the Bob8466 EncyclopediaDramatica entry after the Iowa teen’s suicide. “It is believed that [Boyles] was calmly talked down from going postal, instead unfortunately choosing to take his own life and becoming an [sic] hero to us all,” Atchison wrote under the username AlGore. Like Atchison, Boyles was active on Steam and on YouTube, where he posted videos of simulated school shootings. In Boyle’s final video, a first-person walkthrough of the school where he shot himself, online acquaintances gathered to post comments in memoriam. “Suicides are ignored,” Atchinson wrote, under the name Vance Stone. “Suicidal people who commit mass murder, however, get the entire world’s attention, garner thousands of fans / fangirls, become a household name and become celebrities. “His action of suicide was tragic and it’s a shame he had to go out like that, because he was pretty damn cool when I chatted to him.” Boyle wasn’t Atchison’s only school-shooter friend, according to “Smith,” a YouTuber from Texas who considered Atchison a friend. Smith’s channel, “Aesthetic Autism,” features mostly footage of war synced to music, and he recorded but has not released a podcast with the New Mexico murderer. Smith told The Daily Beast that Ali Sonboly, the teenager who shot and killed nine people in a Munich McDonald’s last year, was also a member of the Steam group that he and Atchison started, called the Anti-Refugee Club. (Smith claims the group—which was taken down two months ago—wasn’t racist but “mostly satire.”) “[Atchison] wasn’t alt-right. He wasn’t a neo-Nazi,” Smith said in a direct message. “Bill hated both sides... His emotions mixed with his politics. “He was edgy, he was offensive, and he was shocking. He said a lot out of pure shock, but I didn’t think he’d be so moronic enough to do what he did,” Smith said. That shocking content brought the FBI to Atchison’s door in 2016. Acting on a tip that Atchison had posted a comment on a gaming forum asking users where he could get “a cheap assault rifle” for a mass shooting, the FBI interviewed him and his family, and ultimately determined that no crime had been committed and closed the investigation. “He was cooperative,” Albuquerque FBI Special Agent Terry Wade said at a press conference last week. “He told us that he enjoyed trolling on the internet. “The agents specifically asked him if he had plans about conducting attacks and expressed the seriousness that we take these type of things. He assured us that he had no such plans,” Wade said. Atchison described the visit on his YouTube channel, writing in a comment, “I was part of the trolling and lulz... the feds investigated me cus some fag reported my profile to troll me... they said they didn’t think I was a serious threat and understood the satire…” The Daily Beast reached out to Agent Wade about Atchison’s online behavior. Wade’s spokesperson referred a reporter to the San Juan County sheriff and said the FBI wouldn’t have further comment on the case at this time. Brice Current, a captain at San Juan County Sheriff’s Office, said they were just beginning to process the crime scene and Atchison’s home, at which they confiscated his computer and Xbox 360. As for a motive, Current could only speculate. “We don’t have a motive other than it was planned,” Current said. “He obviously did something in his life where he came up with this plan and idea and went through with it. Online gaming, or the people he associated with, or what. This was his plan and I don’t know, I don’t know. I really don’t think he had a motive other than to be famous in that world, whatever world that is.” Despite building up a reputation for trolling on forums like EncyclopediaDramatica, Atchison took to other platforms like LiveJournal in a sincere search for someone who would hear his cries for help. On the website Think Atheist, Atchison titled his sole post “Stuck in a Rural Redneck Town” in September 2014. “I don’t want to be lame or anything but I should probably come out about all this,” he wrote. Under the name Demetrius Alcala, Atchison outlines his floundering career and social life in rural New Mexico. He applied to fast-food restaurants and dollar stores and was rejected. He hadn’t had friends since childhood, when two people took advantage of him after he loaned them video-game consoles that were sold or weren’t given back. He had a 3.5 GPA, he said, but dropped out in 10th grade because of anxiety and the “backwards as hell” culture at school. He says he tried to go back but dropped out again, citing his abusive family. He called his father a “fat lazy idiot who watches fox news all day” and his mother “a psycho hillbilly drunk from florida who’s really mentally ill.” Two years before the FBI visited his home, and three years before he killed two people in a New Mexico high school, Atchison pleaded for advice on how to fix his life. “Look, I’m sorry if I’m rude and hateful or anything, but I don’t know what to do. I’ve lived no life for nearly 19 years, most of which was in the miserable ass sun-belt. Did you know new mexico has the fourth highest suicide rate?” Atchison wrote. “Should I escape this dump or deal with it? How can I become polite and make some friends out there in this world?” Over 230 people viewed the post.

185,https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2017/12/12/fbi-cant-protect-us-criminals-can,"By Dallas Morning News Editorial 3:54 PM on Dec 12, 2017 CST Will the nation have to suffer through another criminal tragedy before agencies get on the ball and start reporting  information to the FBI in a timely manner? The latest snafu occurred right here in Texas when Gregory McQueen received approval to be a foster parent for abused and neglected children. While he initially appeared to be a good candidate, it turns out he had no business caring for children in the foster community. McQueen, who served in the Army, pleaded guilty to more than a dozen military charges for attempting to run a prostitution ring in Fort Hood. His actions resulted in a demotion, two years in prison and naturally, a dishonorable discharge. The state says the record should have kept him out of the foster-care program, according to reporting by The Dallas Morning News' Terri Langford. Why was McQueen not flagged? Because the Army never submitted the information to the FBI so it could update the database states rely on for criminal background checks. If this sound familiar, it should. Following the deadly mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, information came to light that revealed the shooter, Devin Kelley, wasn't eligible to possess or own firearms. He wouldn't have been able to acquire the guns he used if the Air Force had submitted his criminal conviction for spousal abuse to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) database used for gun purchases. The FBI utilizes two databases for background checks. For gun purchases, firearms dealers use NICS. For workplace background checks — such as police, attorneys and doctors, in addition to checks for nursery workers or foster-care parents — agencies utilize the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). Both chambers of Congress have introduced the Fix NICS Act designed to hold agencies accountable for not providing information to the FBI to prevent prohibited individuals from purchasing firearms. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, deserves praise for spearheading the effort in the Senate. However, with this latest blunder, it's clear Congress should apply the standards for keeping the databases up to date for both NICS and NCIC. It makes sense to hold agencies accountable for not reporting up-to-date information for gun purchasers, as well as for people who wish to be foster parents. The alarm must sound. In an era when people can make instant payments, order food and book vacations on their phones, it's absurd to have to chase down agencies for the latest criminal information. Lives are at stake. Congress must get this done. Got an opinion about this issue? Send a letter to the editor, and you just might get published. Dallas Morning News Editorial.

The gunman's motive wasn't known but investigators believe it was an isolated incident. ""I want you to know right now that this has nothing to do with terrorism,"" Capt. Robert Plummer told reporters outside the scene of the shooting. The shooting happened before 7 a.m. at Arizona Charlie's Decatur, which is located west of the Las Vegas Strip. According to police, the suspect, Christopher Olague, ran from the hotel-casino after the shooting and into a nearby neighborhood where he tried to enter two homes but the residents were able to keep him out. Police found him in a laundry room accessible through a garage of the second home after he appeared to have shot himself in the head, Lt. Dan McGrath said. According to McGrath, Olague tried to enter the first home with the intention of stealing a car and also tried to take a vehicle on the street. Police described Olague's condition as a ""non-survivable wound."" The victims' identities were not released. Police said the uniformed security guards were a man and a woman in their 40s and that one was armed. Their identities and their causes of death will be released by Clark County Coroner's Office. McGrath said the circumstances of what happened in the hotel room still unclear. The hotel-casino's office did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The shooting comes a day before law enforcement officers expect tens of thousands of New Year's Eve revelers on the Strip and three months after the city dealt with the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Officials have been trying to reassure residents and visitors that the city is safe, especially in the wake of the Oct. 1 shooting. A high-stakes gambler killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below. He then killed himself.

It was the second-coldest on record, with the temperature only 10 degrees (minus 12 degrees Celsius) in New York at midnight. Partygoers bundled up in extra layers, wearing warm hats and face masks, dancing and jogging in place to ward off the cold. There was also tighter security than ever after two terrorist attacks and a rampaging SUV driver who plowed into a crowd on the very spot where the party takes place. The party went off with no major problems. ""Auld Lang Syne"" and ""New York, New York"" played as the crowds cheered. The coldest ball drop celebration was in 1917, when it was only 1 degree (minus 17 degrees Celsius). Rio de Janeiro's main party was celebrated with fireworks erupting on Copacabana beach after the clock struck midnight to usher in the new year. After 17 minutes of a multicolored show in the skies, singer Anitta led the party on stage with her single ""Vai Malandra,"" a song that scored 84 million views on YouTube in two weeks. Some of the city's most traditional Carnival samba schools performed later. New Mayor Marcelo Crivella said he believed the celebrations would bring 3 million people to the iconic beach, which would mean nearly half of Rio's population. But locals said Brazil's economic crisis is still impacting one of the city's biggest parties. In 2017, 2 million people showed up at Copacabana beach, a number that hasn't changed much over the years. Almost 2,000 policemen patrolled the Copacabana region after yet another violent year on the streets. Rio's hotel association said occupation is nearly total, but mostly by Brazilian tourists. Germans rang in 2018 under tight security from police mindful of widespread sexual abuse of women in Cologne two years ago and of a terrorist attack on a Christmas market about a year ago. Police in Berlin added 1,600 officers on duty and said that large bags and knapsacks would not be allowed on the Party Mile leading from Brandenburg Gate, where thousands of people celebrated at midnight. Police in Frankfurt imposed similar restrictions in the celebration area along the Main River in the country's financial capital. Two years ago, New Year's in Cologne was marred by groping and theft committed against hundreds of women, in most cases by migrants. On Dec. 19, 2016, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri drove a stolen truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people. Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, has again served as the focal point of New Year's Eve celebrations — though this year authorities decided against fireworks and chose a massive LED lightshow on it. That was in part due to safety in the city-state in the United Arab Emirates, which saw a massive skyscraper fire on New Year's Eve in 2015. The display, running down the east side of the 828-meter-tall (2,716-foot-tall) tower, showed Arabic calligraphy, geometric designs and a portrait of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE's first president. But a display of neighboring nations' flags didn't show Qatar's flag. The UAE joined Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in boycotting the tiny energy-rich nation in June over allegations Doha supports extremists and has too close ties to Iran. Qatar, which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, denies supporting extremists and shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran. Bidding 2017 farewell, Pope Francis has decried wars, injustices and environmental decay which he says have ""ruined"" the year. Francis on Sunday presided at a New Year's Eve prayer service in St. Peter's Basilica, a traditional occasion to say thanks in each year's last hours. He says God gave to us a 2017 ""whole and sound,"" but that ""we humans in many ways ruined and hurt it with works of death, lies and injustices."" But, he added, ""gratitude prevails"" thanks to those ""cooperating silently for the common good."" In keeping with past practice, the pope on New Year's Day will celebrate Mass dedicated to the theme of world peace. Fireworks lit up the sky above Sydney Harbor, highlighting the city's New Year's celebrations. The massive fireworks display included a rainbow waterfall cascade of lights and color flowing off the harbor's bridge to celebrate recently passed legislation legalizing gay marriage in Australia. More than 1 million people were expected to gather to watch the festivities. Security was tight, but officials said there was no particular alert. Sydney officials said the event would generate about $170 million for the city and ""priceless publicity."" Nearly half the revelers were tourists. Tens of thousands of New Zealanders took to streets and beaches, becoming among the first in the world to usher in 2018. As the new year dawned in this southern hemisphere nation, fireworks boomed and crackled above city centers and harbors, and party-goers sang, hugged, danced and kissed. In Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city, tens of thousands gathered around Sky Tower as five minutes of nonstop pyrotechnics exploded from the top of the structure. But on nearby Waiheke Island, 30 kilometers (20 miles) away, authorities canceled the planned fireworks display because of drought conditions and low water supplies for firefighters. Thousands of Ugandans gathered at churches across the country to mark the end of 2017. The raucous events, during which some preachers are known to make dubious predictions, have become such a staple of New Year's Eve festivities that the country's longtime president, Yoweri Museveni, sometimes makes time to make an appearance at a church. Still, many in this East African country prefer to celebrate at crowded beaches on the shores of Lake Victoria or in darkened halls listening to the music of pop stars who take turns offering crowd pleasers until midnight. Police warned revelers not to burn car tires in celebration, citing safety reasons, to discourage a favorite activity of those, especially in the countryside, who cannot afford fireworks. As Russians counted down the last moments before 2018 ticked over into each of the country's 11 time zones, President Vladimir Putin called on them to be considerate and conciliatory with each other in the new year. ""Say the most cherished words to each other, forgive mistakes and resentment, admit love, warm up with care and attention,"" Putin said in a televised message broadcast on Sunday just before midnight. Moscow had fireworks and outdoor gatherings despite weather that was less than festive. Usually festooned with snow at New Year's Eve, the Russian capital slogged through a long spell of intermittent rain and constant gray skies. Many Japanese celebrated the arrival of the Year of the Dog in the traditional way of praying for peace and good fortune at neighborhood Shinto shrines and eating New Year's food such as noodles, shrimp and sweet black beans. Barbecued beef and octopus dumpling stalls were out at Tokyo's Zojoji Temple, where people took turns striking the giant bell 108 times at midnight, an annual practice repeated at other Buddhist temples throughout Japan. North Korea's nuclear and missile programs cast a shadow over Japan's hopes for peace, said cab driver Masaru Eguchi, who was ready to be busy all night shuttling shrine visitors. ""The world situation has grown so complex,"" Eguchi said, adding that he also worried about possible terrorism targeting Japan. ""I feel this very abstracted sense of uncertainty, although I really have no idea what might happen."" Security was tight in the southern Indian city of Bangalore to prevent a repeat of incidents of groping and molestation of several women during New Year's Eve celebrations a year ago. Police Commissioner Sunil Kumar said at least 15,000 police officers were on duty and were being aided by drones and closed-circuit television cameras. A year ago, police first denied that any sexual harassment had taken place during the celebrations in Bangalore, India's information technology hub. But later, police detained at least six men after several video clips of women being attacked by groups of men spread on social media. Scores of people were injured by celebratory firecrackers in the Philippines, which has some of the most raucous New Year's celebrations in Asia. Although the number of injuries has tapered off in recent years, largely due to hard economic times and government scare campaigns, the figures remain alarming. President Rodrigo Duterte signed an order confining the use of firecrackers to community-designated areas, such as near shopping malls and parks. Many Filipinos, largely influenced by Chinese tradition, believe that noisy New Year's celebrations drive away evil and misfortune. But they have carried that superstition to extremes, exploding dangerously large firecrackers and firing guns to welcome the new year despite threats of arrest. Security measures were ramped up across Turkey, which a year ago was hit by a New Year's attack that killed dozens of people. In Istanbul, 37,000 officers were on duty, with multiple streets closed to traffic and large vehicles barred from entering certain districts. Several New Year's Eve street parties were canceled for security reasons. Early on Jan. 1, 2017, an assailant shot his way into Istanbul's Reina nightclub, where hundreds of people were celebrating New Year's. Thirty-nine people, mostly foreigners, were killed, and 79 were wounded. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. On Sunday, about 100 people gathered outside the nightclub to remember the victims of the attack. The Golden State will go green when the calendar turns to 2018. Starting at midnight, California will join the growing list of states to legalize recreational marijuana. The moment is a significant but small step that will not be met with a non-stop pot party. California has allowed medical marijuana for more than a decade, and the state is generally tolerant of the drug, so major changes are not expected as the laws are further eased. At least not on New Year's Day. More than 70 outlets received licenses to sell in time for Jan. 1. None of those outlets is holding a midnight opening, but some in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area will be open for business starting at 6 a.m. Monday. Some cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, will have to wait at least until later in the week before licensed outlets start selling there. Tens of thousands of revelers will ring in the new year in Las Vegas under the close eye of law enforcement just three months after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Tourism officials expect about 330,000 people to visit Las Vegas for the festivities, which are anchored by a roughly eight-minute fireworks display at the top of seven casino-hotels. Acts including Bruno Mars, Britney Spears, Celine Dion and the Foo Fighters will keep partiers entertained before and after midnight at properties across Sin City. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had every officer working Sunday, while the Nevada National Guard activated about 350 soldiers and airmen. The federal government sent dozens of personnel to assist with intelligence and other efforts.

Ultimately, he was the person who persuaded Lo to surrender. ""I had no training for any of this,"" Larkin said. ""There was no script."" GREAT BARRINGTON — Officer Kevin Larkin was missing his newborn daughter when he got the most important call of his life — and perhaps many lives. He was on desk duty at the former police headquarters on Castle Street when a call came Dec. 14, 1992, that would scare him in a ways he never imagined. ""I had no training for any of this,"" Larkin, 56, said in an interview at The Eagle bureau in Great Barrington. ""There was no script."" The call came at 10:23 p.m. from the police dispatcher in Lee, who was called by Bruce Beavers, the husband of a Bard College at Simon's Rock security guard who had just been shot at point-blank range by Wayne Lo, at the start of his rampage on campus that night. Lo murdered language professor Nacunan Saez next, then would kill Galen Gibson in the library, and wound Thomas McElderry there before injuring Joshua Faber and Matthew David at their dorm. Miraculously, Teresa Beavers, the security guard, also lived. Larkin, who had graduated from the police academy five years earlier, sent officers Mark Stannard and Clifford Twiss to the college. The officers radioed Larkin back: ""Better send some help,"" they said. Through the radio, Larkin heard Lo's rounds going off. ""I knew we were up against something not good,"" he said. ""You know that movie 'Heartbreak Ridge' with Clint Eastwood? The [semiautomatic] makes a distinctive sound."" That's when calls began flooding in and Larkin rolled into action. He called another officer. ""Someone's shooting up the campus,"" he told him. ""No way,"" the officer responded. ""Just get your [expletive] over there."" Then Larkin got what he believes was the most important call of his life. It was from Wayne Lo. ""I'm the guy that shot up the campus,"" he said Lo told him. Lo's semiautomatic rifle had repeatedly jammed during his spree, and Lo finally gave up, went to the cafeteria in the student union and called police. ""I want to talk to you,"" Larkin told him. ""He said, `I don't want to talk about it.' "" ""OK,"" Larkin told him. ""So we just started talking about the football game, and I knew that by keeping him on the phone, everything was going to be all right."" Lo told him where he was, and Larkin knew that Lo would have a good view of the campus below. ""Where does this end?"" Larkin said he asked Lo, adding that the conversation was calm. ""We were talking on the phone like you and I are talking now. It was like [Lo] was ordering a Big Mac and fries, like he was at McDonald's."" ""He said, `I don't want to hurt anybody else.' "" ""I said, `Well, OK, but you've got to understand that if you don't do exactly as I tell you, we're gonna [expletive] kill you.'"" Still trying keep Lo on the phone, Larkin asked him why he stopped shooting. Lo said it was because the gun jammed. "" 'And if it didn't, more people were going down,' he said to me."" Larkin still marvels at his own presence of mind, under such circumstances, to do what he did next. ""I had the phone in one hand as I was telling [Lo] what to do, and keyed the mic so the officers at the scene knew what I was telling him."" Which was this: "" `I want you to walk out of the building with your hands interlocked on top of your head.' I didn't know if he was alone or had other weapons."" Then he asked Lo if he was ready, and said that if he deviated from what Larkin told him, ""you're gonna die."" ""He puts the phone down, and I heard him walk out — it seemed like hours."" After sounds of many stomping feet, his best friend on the force, Louie Sinico, picked up the phone. ""Louie said, `We got the [expletive] and now we're going to have a cigarette.' Louie had been to Vietnam. I really wanted him there."" At the station, Larkin called Police Chief William Walsh, District Attorney Gerard Downing and his first assistant, David Capeless. He said that when Capeless arrived at the station, he had a ""calming influence."" ""When I saw David come in, I knew everything would be OK."" But when Lo was hauled into the station, Larkin said that, despite the police presence and the handcuffs, he felt frightened by the look in Lo's eyes. Larkin, who retired in 2005 after 23 years on the force, said that, in those days, there were no debriefings. Larkin eventually went home, took a shower, then went back to work. He remains frustrated every time there's a mass shooting. ""It's not knowing how to fix it,"" he said. ""It's `Why can't we stop this?' "" He said popular music, movies and video games are one culprit. ""I can tell you from firsthand experience that it ain't no game — the blood and the screams are real."" Also, that it could happen in this ""Norman Rockwell-esque"" town ""changed everything,"" Larkin said. Wearing a New York Yankees jacket, necklace and rings, Larkin, a baseball writer, said the sport has helped him over the years, and that one of his idols, Lou Gehrig, gives him strength.

BANNER HEADLINE -- PENSACOLA NEWS JOURNAL: “YOU WILL NEVER BE IGNORED AGAIN ... Trump: Vote for Roy Moore in Alabama special election” http://bit.ly/2y9Zqol OBAMA SPEAKS!, via CNN’s Miranda Green: “‘You have to tend to this garden of democracy, otherwise things can fall apart fairly quickly. And we’ve seen societies where that happens,’ Obama said at the Economic Club of Chicago on Tuesday, according to video of the event. ‘Now, presume there was a ballroom here in Vienna in the late 1920s or ‘30s that looked and seemed as if it, filled with the music and art and literature that was emerging, would continue into perpetuity.

Putin dispatched Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov to Washington for a July 17 meeting with Under Secretary Tom Shannon, the No. 3 official at the State Department. … [T]hree U.S. administration officials, including one inside the meeting, said Ryabkov handed over a document containing a bold proposal: A sweeping noninterference agreement between Moscow and Washington that would prohibit both governments from meddling in the other’s domestic politics. “After examining the proposal, which has not previously been reported, U.S. officials told Moscow there would be no deal. ‘We said “thank you very much but now is not the time for this,”’ said a senior State Department official. … The decision to walk away from the offer could prove fateful. Signs of Russian meddling in foreign elections continue to flourish ... The US official described the Russian proposal in historic terms, likening it to the 1933 accord between President Franklin Roosevelt and Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov that ended 16 years of American nonrecognition of the Soviet Union in exchange for a pledge not to interfere in US politics.” http://bzfd.it/2B13LzX BOMBSHELLS -- AP’s JULIET LINDERMAN: “Ex-aide: Rep. Franks offered $5 million to carry his child”: “The former staffer said the Arizona congressman asked at least four times if she’d be willing to act as a surrogate in exchange for money. Franks, in his statement announcing his resignation, said he and his wife, who have struggled with infertility, have twins who were carried through surrogacy. “The former aide said the conversations took place in private, sometimes in the congressman’s car, and that she repeatedly told him she wasn’t interested. She said she never filed a formal complaint because until recently she didn’t know where to go, but that his behavior had made her feel uncomfortable. “The Associated Press verified the identity of the staffer and confirmed that she worked in Franks’ office. She asked that her name be withheld out of concern for her privacy. ‘During my time there, I was asked a few times to look over a ‘contract’ to carry his child, and if I would conceive his child, I would be given $5 million,’ she said, adding that she refused to look over the contract and has never seen a copy.” http://bit.ly/2BPnLlB -- FRANKS IS WORTH between $11.1 million and $55.25 million with most of his money in Trinity Petroleum stock, according to his most recent financial disclosure. -- RACHAEL BADE and JAKE SHERMAN: “Female aides fretted Franks wanted to have sex to impregnate them”: “Arizona Rep. Trent Franks allegedly made unwanted advances toward female staffers in his office and retaliated against one who rebuffed him, according to House GOP sources with knowledge of a complaint against him. … “A former staffer also alleged that Franks tried to persuade a female aide that they were in love by having her read an article that described how a person knows they’re in love with someone, the sources said. One woman believed she was the subject of retribution after rebuffing Franks. While she enjoyed access to the congressman before the incident, that access was revoked afterward, she told Republican leaders.” http://politi.co/2khknZU MORE FRANKS INTRIGUE -- SETTING UP A SUPER PAC? -- “Fox 9 confronts Rep. Franks before his immediate resignation,” by Tom Lyden of the Minneapolis/St. Paul Fox affiliate: “While in Washington D.C. covering the resignation of Senator Al Franken, our Fox 9 crew encountered a different lawmaker facing a controversy of his own. Outside their hotel room [at the Hotel Palomar], Fox 9 reporter Tom Lyden noticed Republican Congressman Trent Franks of Arizona speaking on his cell phone. ... But listening in on his call, Fox 9 heard him talking to someone about getting $2 million to start a political action committee on the filibuster issue. Fox 9 then asked Franks about the exchange on camera. “Tom Lyden: ‘You are still in office and I heard you on the phone talking about setting up a $2 million PAC to go after the issue of the filibuster, is that proper for you to be doing while your still in office?’ Congressman Franks: ‘Well, that’s something I’m not going to discuss.’ Lyden: ‘But I heard you on the phone talking about soliciting $2 million for a PAC while you’re still in office, that seems to be an ethics violation?’ Franks: ‘No, I don’t think so.’”4-min. video  http://bit.ly/2B2SO0v -- ACTUALLY, yes, it wouldn’t only be an ethics violation, it would be illegal if he explicitly asked someone for $2 million while still serving in office.

Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!” … at 8:02 a.m.: “Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed, just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his ‘mistake’). Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?” … at 7:52 a.m.: “A big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night.

Jackson: “It took him a while, but President Donald Trump eventually used a Friday-night rally to forcefully endorse Roy Moore, the embattled Alabama Republican running for the Senate. Trump framed the election of Moore — who has been accused of numerous episodes of inappropriate sexual behavior, including child molestation — as vital to the country’s interest, imploring Alabamians to ‘get out and vote for Roy Moore.’ ‘Do it,’ he added. ‘Do it.’ ... “As the race draws to a close, the White House is considering taking other steps to boost Moore, including flooding the state with robocalls, text messages and emails. While the president’s popularity has ebbed elsewhere, he remains overwhelmingly popular in conservative Alabama. The administration has reviewed polling that shows Moore with a narrow but steady lead — and is confident that he will win.” http://politi.co/2kO21DK THE HOUSE GUYS who traveled with Trump: Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.): “We’ve got an economy that’s growing and illegal immigration that’s slowing … We are draining the swamp and rebuilding our military.” … Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.): “This is a president that is facing unprecedented opposition from the Democrats, from the media, but I repeat myself… from the other swamp dwellers. … We need to enact term limits for members of Congress.” -- FOR THE RECORD: Gaetz’s father is Don Gaetz, the former president of the Florida Senate. DeSantis -- a Yale grad who picked up a law degree from Harvard -- is eyeing a race for governor after three terms in D.C. TRUMP’S SATURDAY -- Trump is headed to Jackson, Mississippi, to visit the Civil Rights Museum which he will get a tour of and also give remarks. He will then fly to West Palm Beach, Florida. -- FROM POOLER TODD GILLMAN: “The president’s motorcade pulled out of Mar-a-Lago at 8:57 a.m. in a light rain. It arrived at Air Force One at 9:09 in a Florida deluge whipped by wind. The tarmac covered in water. Pool is soaked. … The president is scheduled to be wheels up at 11:55, while the outdoor phase of the ceremony [at the Civil Rights Museum] is underway.” IN CALIFORNIA -- “Firefighters had to step aside as winds powered infernos,” by AP’s Julie Watson and Krysta Fauria in Fallbrook, California: “Firefighters in Southern California were on high alert for dangerous fire potential even before the first blazes broke out. But once flames met ferocious winds, fire crews were mostly powerless to stop infernos that destroyed more than 500 buildings, killed dozens of horses and forced hundreds of thousands of people to run from six out-of-control fires that have burned over 260 square miles since Monday. ... “Firefighters gained ground Friday, and some of the earliest evacuees who fled from flames Monday were being allowed to return home. Yet new fires were popping up, and danger persisted. Vegetation is bone dry, there’s been hardly any rainfall and winds were expected to gusts up to 40 mph Saturday and up to 50 mph Sunday in the Los Angeles and Ventura areas, the National Weather Service said.” http://bit.ly/2iJK2df GREAT LEDE -- “Trump calls Romney ‘a great man,’ but works to undermine him and block Senate run,” by WaPo’s Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey: “Before Ronna Romney McDaniel took over as Republican National Committee chairwoman earlier this year, President Trump had a request: Would she be willing to stop using her middle name publicly? Trump followed up by saying in a lighthearted way that McDaniel, the niece of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, could do what she wanted, according to two people familiar with the comments. But the change was soon plain for all to see. Though she had used her maiden name for years in Michigan, where her grandfather George W. Romney had been governor, McDaniel dropped ‘Romney’ from most official party communications and has rarely used it since.”  http://wapo.st/2kGzU9d NYT SCOOP -- “F.B.I. Warned Hope Hicks About Emails From Russian Operatives,” by Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo: “F.B.I. officials warned one of President Trump’s top advisers, Hope Hicks, earlier this year about repeated attempts by Russian operatives to make contact with her during the presidential transition, according to people familiar with the events. The Russian outreach efforts show that, even after American intelligence agencies publicly accused Moscow of trying to influence the outcome of last year’s presidential election, Russian operatives were undaunted in their efforts to establish contacts with Mr. Trump’s advisers. There is no evidence that Ms. Hicks did anything improper. According to former officials, American intelligence and law enforcement agencies became alarmed by introductory emails that Ms. Hicks received from Russian government addresses in the weeks after Mr. Trump’s election. “After he took office, senior F.B.I. counterintelligence agents met with Ms. Hicks in the White House Situation Room at least twice, gave her the names of the Russians who had contacted her, and said that they were not who they claimed to be. The F.B.I. was concerned that the emails to Ms. Hicks may have been part of a Russian intelligence operation, and they urged Ms. Hicks to be cautious.” http://nyti.ms/2AoIf8G -- “Trump’s Allies Urge Harder Line as Mueller Probe Heats Up,” by WSJ’sPeter Nicholas, Aruna Viswanatha and Erica Orden: “Republicans ... point to Andrew Weissmann — a Mueller deputy who had applauded the Justice Department’s decision not to defend the initial White House travel ban on people from majority Muslim nations—as evidence of bias on the special counsel team. ‘I am so proud,’ Mr. Weissmann wrote in the subject line of an email, which was released by the conservative group Judicial Watch. Mr. Weissmann also attended Hillary Clinton’s election-night party at the Jacob K. Javits Center in New York, according to people familiar with his attendance. At the time, Mr. Weissmann was running the Justice Department’s fraud section, which is a senior career post within the agency.”  http://on.wsj.com/2keZQoJ ""HITTING THE PAUSE BUTTON"" -- “Democratic senators delay K.T. McFarland ambassador nomination,” by Cristiano Lima: “Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) on Friday placed a hold on K.T. McFarland’s nomination to become U.S. ambassador to Singapore, urging congressional leaders to re-examine her ‘knowledge and involvement’ in contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. “In a letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the two members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced their intent to delay the nomination process until McFarland ‘publicly clarifies’ potential discrepancies in her statements regarding communications between Michael Flynn, her former superior at the National Security Council, and a Russian diplomat.” http://politi.co/2A8syyf THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT FILES -- “Taxpayers Paid $220K to Settle Case Involving Rep. Alcee Hastings,” by Roll Call’s Stephanie Akin: “The Treasury Department paid $220,000 in a previously undisclosed agreement to settle a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment that involved Florida Democrat Alcee L. Hastings, according to documents obtained by Roll Call. Winsome Packer, a former staff member of a congressional commission that promotes international human rights, said in documents that the congressman touched her, made unwanted sexual advances, and threatened her job. At the time, Hastings was the chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, where Packer worked. Hastings has called Packer’s charges ‘ludicrous’ and in documents said he never sexually harassed her.”  http://bit.ly/2BPd1nh FLASHBACK -- “House ethics panel scolds several lawmakers,” by Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan on Dec. 11, 2014: “Both the Ethics Committee and OCE looked into Packer’s allegations. OCE recommended a full-scale investigation by Ethics even though it was not able to determine if there was ‘substantial reason to believe’ Packer’s claim, but Ethics decided not to take that step. In its report on the Hastings’ matter, Ethics said that ‘while the most serious allegations were not supported by the evidence, Representative Hastings has admitted to certain conduct that is less than professional.’ ... “The Ethics Committee stated: ‘Despite the fact that the conduct in this case does not rise to the level of actionable violations of the rules, the Committee does not want to leave the impression that Representative Hastings’ behavior was at all times appropriate. He admitted to some conduct that, while not wrongful per se, certainly could be misunderstood… Nevertheless, hugging is not the most professional way to greet coworkers, and different individuals have different comfort levels for touching others.’” http://politi.co/2A5J8yB BEYOND CONGRESS -- “For Female Lobbyists, Harassment Often Accompanies Access,” by NYT’s Trip Gabriel and Julie Bosman: “Vanessa Alarid was a lobbyist in New Mexico when she asked a lawmaker over drinks one night if she could count on his support for a bill that appeared to be coming down to a single vote. ‘You can have my vote if you have sex with me,’ Ms. Alarid recalled the lawmaker saying, although he used cruder language for sexual intercourse. He told Ms. Alarid she had the same first name as his wife, so he would not get confused if he called out in bed. “Then he kissed Ms. Alarid on the lips, she said. Shocked, Ms. Alarid, who was 32 at the time, pushed him away. Only after he was gone did she let the tears flow. When her bill came up on the floor of the New Mexico House of Representatives the next day, March 20, 2009, it failed by a single vote, including a ‘No’ by the lawmaker, Representative Thomas A. Garcia. As Ms. Alarid watched from the House gallery, she said, Mr. Garcia blew her a kiss and shrugged his shoulders with arms spread.”  http://nyti.ms/2iGY8fc -- “Prominent appeals court Judge Alex Kozinski accused of sexual misconduct,” by WaPo’s Matt Zapotosky: “A former clerk for Judge Alex Kozinski said the powerful and well-known jurist, who for many years served as chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, called her into his office several times and pulled up pornography on his computer, asking if she thought it was photoshopped or if it aroused her sexually. Heidi Bond, who clerked for Kozinski from 2006 to 2007, said the porn was not related to any case. “One set of images she remembered was of college-age students at a party where ‘some people were inexplicably naked while everyone else was clothed.’ Another was a sort of digital flip book that allowed users to mix and match heads, torsos and legs to create an image of a naked woman. Bond is one of six women — all former clerks or more junior staffers known as externs in the 9th Circuit — who alleged to The Washington Post in recent weeks that Kozinski, now 67 and still serving as a judge on the court, subjected them to a range of inappropriate sexual conduct or comments. She is one of two former clerks who said Kozinski asked them to view porn in his chambers.”  http://wapo.st/2jBfvPv -- “Ex-Fox News anchor claims Trump tried to kiss her,” by Page Six’s Emily Smith: “Former Fox News anchor Juliet Huddy said President Donald Trump tried to kiss her in an elevator around the time he married First Lady Melania. Huddy, who allegedly received a settlement after she made a complaint against disgraced anchor Bill O’Reilly, described how the mogul leaned in to kiss her after he took her to lunch at Trump Tower in 2005. The TV newswoman, who now hosts a radio show on WABC Radio, revealed on ‘Mornin!!! with Bill Schulz’ on compoundmedia.com, that she had rebuffed the now-president in the Trump Tower elevator. And Trump later appeared on her Fox News chat show, and joked to the audience, ‘I hit on her but she blew me off.’” http://pge.sx/2kesOVw AROUND THE TAX HORN -- “Trump’s casual tax comments scald his Hill allies, again,” by Nancy Cook: “Oops, President Donald Trump did it again. His casual mention of a 22 percent corporate rate on his way to New York last Saturday kicked off a week of unexpected haggling on a topline tax issue many considered already settled, just as congressional negotiators are rushing to get a final bill to the president in time for Christmas -- a date he himself has insisted on. “It’s the latest example of the president getting in the way of his party’s major legislative goal, even if unintentionally, and once again shows the perils for policymakers and legislators in the Trump era, when an unexpected, off-the-cuff comment or tweet can undo weeks of work. On Friday, more than 20 conservative groups — including Americans for Tax Reform, Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and the National Taxpayers Union — sent a letter to congressional conferees reminding them that the groups’ original support for any tax overhaul was tied to that magic 20 percent figure.” http://politi.co/2iG1nUq HEY, KEVIN MCCARTHY! -- WSJ’S NOUR MALAS and KRISTINA PETERSON, with an Irvine, California, dateline: “California House Republican Hears It at Home Over Tax Bill: Rep. Mimi Walters’s constituents worry about mortgage-interest cap, end to local deductions”: “In her district’s biggest city and across its conservative bastions, Republican U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters is facing criticism over the GOP tax overhaul bill that she voted for last month. The bill might increase taxes for many of her constituents, rather than lower them. “Under pressure from frustrated supporters, she is now working to modify the bill to ease the blow as lawmakers try to hash out a compromise with a measure passed by the Senate. Three of California’s 14 House Republicans voted against the bill last month, citing measures that would curb or even eliminate some key deductions used widely by Californians. Mrs. Walters’s support for the bill, by contrast, has drawn scrutiny from some at a tense moment for the state’s Republicans, ahead of competitive midterm elections next year. “‘I’m not going to vote for a Democrat, but am I going to vote for a Republican that is going to raise my taxes? That is the question,’ said Jeffrey Lalloway, a divorce lawyer and Republican member of Irvine’s City Council.” http://on.wsj.com/2kLsgui LISTEN IN to the latest bonus Playbook Audio Briefing episode from our live recording Thursday night at Sixth and I Synagogue.

A firm end date has not been decided on, a White House official said, but Powell is likely to leave in January or early February. Dr. Nadia Schadlow, a deputy assistant to the president who works on the National Security Council, is seen as Powell’s likely successor … Schadlow has been deeply involved with Trump’s forthcoming national security strategy plan. ... “Trump ... did not want Powell to leave and asked her to stay on the team. It is not clear what role she will continue to play from the outside. ‘Dina has been an invaluable member of President Trump’s team,’ McMaster said in a statement. ‘Her sage advice helped provide options to the president and her strong relationships across the U.S. government and internationally helped drive execution of the president’s decisions. She is one of the most talented and effective leaders with whom I have ever served.’”  http://politi.co/2kL69Eb -- JIM MATTIS statement: “With the pending departure of Dina Powell, we are losing an invaluable member of the President’s national security team.

The Times’s analysis found that in the 42 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm, 1,052 more people than usual died across the island. The analysis compared the number of deaths for each day in 2017 with the average of the number of deaths for the same days in 2015 and 2016. Officially, just 62 people died as a result of the storm that ravaged the island with nearly 150-mile-an-hour winds, cutting off power to 3.4 million Puerto Ricans.

Transcript, via White House:

MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: Sarah, today is the fifth anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre in which so many children were killed.  That, of course, as a tragedy, was eclipsed by what happened in Las Vegas, which is now the most tragic mass shooting on U.S. soil.

Since that time, what has President Trump done to try to protect the American people against a similar type of massacre?  Does he think anything has been done?  What is the administration trying to do?  Is there anything at the executive level that he thinks needs to be undertaken?

SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE:  Look, I think that there are a number of different ways that we look to protect our citizens.  Every single day, one of the areas that the President has been outspoken about â not necessarily to those two instances â but just more broadly speaking in terms of national security and protecting individuals certainly through border security, stronger vetting processes, and looking at whether or not there are other regulations that we could put in place that would offer protection â

REPORTER: But these were domestic shooters.  These werenât people who entered the United States.

MS. SANDERS:  Right.  And I said Iâm speaking more broadly in terms of national security as a whole.  And look, this is a President who knows that his number-one responsibility is to look for ways to protect American citizens.  And we try to do that every single day.

And whether or not thereâs a regulation that could have been put in place, or not, that could have prevented those things, frankly, Iâm not aware of what that would be.  But we want to look for every opportunity, every way possible, that we can to protect American lives.  And weâre going to continue doing that.

REPORTER: So is it correct to say that the administration is looking at how to prevent these kind of mass shootings by domestic shooters on U.S. soil?  Or is it just the issue of immigrants and terrorism?

MS. SANDERS:  I know thatâs something that â absolutely, I know thatâs something that the Department of Homeland Security looks at and talks about and works on every single day.  I donât think thereâs a person in this country that wouldnât like us to find ways to protect people, and weâre certainly very supportive of that.  And thatâs something that would be â

REPORTER: But no one issue that that the President has highlighted that says he wants to make a priority to push forward?

MS. SANDERS:  Well, I donât think thereâs any one thing that you could do that could have prevented either one of those instances â those horrible, horrible tragedies.

REPORTER: But there were prescriptions given very quickly just the other day for this failed terrorist attack, which is why in these cases â I mean, this is the worst shooting on U.S. soil on President Trumpâs watch.

MS. SANDERS:  I understand that.  And thatâs why I also think that you have to take these matters, obviously, very seriously.  But if you could name a single thing that would have prevented both of these, Iâd love to hear it, because I donât know what that would look like.  But weâre looking every single day at how you can protect American lives, how we can best protect American citizens.

In terms of New York, we know for a fact this individual came through a chain migration system.  This is something the President has been outspokenly against and something that he wants to stop.  And that individual wouldnât have been here in order to commit that crime if that wasnât in place.  So thatâs a fact that we do know.

REPORTER:  Does it involve a weapons ban, any kind of regulation, any kind of mental health concerns?  Has the President specifically mentioned that as a possibility?

MS. SANDERS:  I know that theyâre looking at some of the mental health issues.  Itâs something the President has raised before.  But in terms of a specific policy that weâre moving forward with that would have prevented that, Iâm not aware of what that would be.

198,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/magazine/what-makes-luke-bryan-country.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Feature Luke Bryan has been testing the sonic limits of country music for a decade. Just how much novelty can the genre take? Luke Bryan outside his tour bus in Concord, Calif., in November.Credit...Devin Yalkin for The New York Times Supported by By Will Stephenson Mitchell Willoughby swallowed 25 live crickets to win his backstage passes to the Luke Bryan concert in Fort Wayne, Ind. He bragged about the feat — a challenge from a local radio station — to Bryan’s face while the country star was making the rounds at his standard meet-and-greet before the show. Bryan looked taken aback. “You just, like, swallowed ’em whole?” he asked, visibly disgusted. “Alive?” Mitchell nodded proudly. Bryan shook his head and moved on to the next fan, a preteen girl who was already shivering and in tears. It was a Thursday night in October, and Bryan was midway through his ninth annual Farm Tour. More than 10,000 people had trekked from all over Indiana and the rest of the Midwest to see him perform on this geographically remote patch of earth. The tour, Bryan’s lead guitarist and longtime friend, Michael Carter, told me, was an attempt to recreate the shows they played while in community college in southern Georgia, when they would enlist a friend with some land and “set up on a flatbed trailer or on a porch or in a barn.” The scale of the operation has changed drastically in the intervening years. Bryan has been in the spotlight for a decade — a career that has included having three albums top the Billboard 200, singing the national anthem at this year’s Super Bowl and co-starring in ABC’s coming reboot of “American Idol.” The Farm Tour now employs well over a hundred crew members (including cooks and a full-time massage therapist), who construct a high-capacity concert arena from scratch every morning and then break it down each night after Bryan’s encore with a kind of supernatural efficiency, leaving the fields empty and clear as the circuslike convoy of more than 60 buses and tractor-trailers heads on to the next farming community. They go to sleep on their respective buses and wake up in a new town they’ve often never heard of. “I don’t even know where I am right now,” one roadie told me that day in Fort Wayne. “What state or nothing. It’s a blur.” The farms change, but Bryan’s preshow ritual does not vary. Before taking the stage each night, he spends an hour riding a propped-up bicycle. Then he mixes himself a salty dog — grapefruit juice and vodka, with a generous pinch of salt. His stylist, Cheryl, presents him with the evening’s outfit, almost always some variation on a solid-color V-neck, baseball cap and jeans. She rubs his arms with moisturizer until they glisten. Finally, he throws on his cowboy boots, which he secures tightly to his ankles with tape. He needs the extra protection when, in his words, he’s “in the heat of the battle up there.” If you haven’t seen a mainstream country concert in recent years, you might not know what he means by this, but a Luke Bryan show is a deeply athletic affair. As his band begins its opening licks, he emerges from the darkness to raucous screams from the crowd. He jogs down the catwalk, grabbing hands and beaming. Onstage, he is more Freddie Mercury than George Strait — he leaps into the air and growls sensually and is known for his unique brand of hip-shaking, which seems both earnest and self-effacingly ridiculous. He lines up tequila shots on the lid of a piano and lobs cans of Miller Lite (a sponsor) out to the audience from a cooler wheeled out for this express purpose. Bryan’s 2015 album, “Kill the Lights,” was the first in history to have six singles reach No.1 on the Billboard Country Airplay charts, and his crowds know every word to all of them. He also makes a point to mine his earlier records for fan favorites like “Country Man” (“I can grow my own groceries and salt-cure a ham/Hey, baby, I’m a country man”) and the self-explanatory “Rain Is a Good Thing,” both of which resonate powerfully with the farm-town audiences. Generally unburdened by a guitar, Bryan caps off every song he performs in a kind of triumphant superhero pose, pumping his fists or pointing up at the sky. For years now, Bryan and his generation of pop-country artists have been testing the sonic integrity of country music — a genre with a reputation for being highly inelastic — bending it to the larger demands of the marketplace by incorporating influences from the worlds of rap, R&B, EDM and arena rock. Bryan grew up listening to 2 Live Crew and Eazy-E alongside Ronnie Milsap and Reba McEntire, and his catalog bears their imprint. His new album, “What Makes You Country,” which will be released this week, acts as a statement of purpose from its opening track: “You do your kind of country,” he sings. “They doing their kind of country/I do my kind of country.” The term most often used for the music made by artists like Bryan is “bro-country,” coined by the critic Jody Rosen in 2013. “Music by and of the tatted, gym-toned, party-hearty young American white dude,” Rosen wrote, calling Bryan the “king of the genre.” Bryan has indeed made it clear that he’s not interested in baring his soul, or in emulating earlier country aesthetics. His guiding principle is that his music should please as many people as possible — ideally stadiums full of them — and to that end, he’s willing to use whatever tools (from whatever genres) he deems helpful. If that means making what is essentially a rap song about clubbing in a cornfield (“Kick the Dust Up”) or an R&B sex jam with lyrics like “Feel my belt turn loose from these old bluejeans” (“Strip It Down”), then so be it. But like all great country catalogs, Bryan’s music at its core evinces a careful balance of the hedonistic and the reverent — at ease in the space between the dive bar and the church, between spring break and the farm. It still came as a surprise, though, in Fort Wayne when he was able to bring the wild proceedings to a sudden halt to address the mass shooting in Las Vegas, which had occurred over the weekend. “It’s been a rough week for me personally,” he said to the crowd, wiping the sweat from his brow, “and probably the worst week in the history of country music.” The audience knew exactly what he meant, and the volume fell to a hush. Like a preacher at a tent revival, he asked us to put our arms around one another and bow our heads, to keep praying about the problems our country faced. “Let’s get to working on this, y’all,” he said. “Let’s try to learn from it and make a change.” In the moment of silence that followed — 15 seconds that seemed much longer — it became suddenly apparent again that we were in the middle of the Indiana woods. Then the moment passed, and the crowd was chanting: “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” Bryan gave a shout-out to police officers and firefighters, soldiers and schoolteachers. And just like that, his swagger was restored. “Let’s do some party crashing on a Thursday night,” he shouted. The crowd roared its approval, and the band came back to life. One afternoon several years ago, my uncle and his family took their new boat out for a test run off their dock on the Flint River in southwestern Georgia. Around the point where the Muckalee and Kinchafoonee Creeks flow into the river proper, the boat’s engine sputtered and died, and they found themselves stranded. Before long, however, an older, well-tanned woman in a bass boat called out to them and volunteered to help. My cousin insisted they were fine. “I wouldn’t be turning down help,” she replied, before pulling up alongside and asking if they’d like a beer. “I’m Luke Bryan’s mom,” she said, as if by way of explanation, before offering to tow them home. I heard stories like this for years, as Bryan evolved from a local phenomenon — he grew up in Leesburg, just upriver from my hometown, Albany — to arguably the biggest star in Nashville. His songs are largely about trying to carve out a good time in dull, desolate places; the images you get from his lyrics are of vast, rural stretches of eerie nothingness. It’s a landscape I recognize from our corner of Georgia — the pecan trees and cotton fields punctuated by boiled-peanut stands, the occasional collection of cows and every conceivable variety of grain elevator. Bryan is an enthusiastic ambassador for the area, and in his capricious approach to country, he is channeling the diverse mix of sounds that kids in his town, and others like it, were listening to. In many respects, country and hip-hop are sister genres, the pop styles that most reliably make room for God and work, black-market economies and regional pride. In the media, and particularly in the South, they have often found themselves pitted against each other, an opposition born of the culture wars and of the region’s catastrophic racial history. But my own experience was that most teenagers who listened to country (or jam bands or nu-metal) were just as likely to be familiar with the songs in regular rotation on rap radio. Rap was ubiquitous — it was the soundtrack at football pep rallies and, as Bryan has pointed out, at the same dive bars that hosted artists like him. He has a visceral understanding of places like this, whether Leesburg, Ga., or Fort Wayne, Ind. So why, I asked Bryan the next afternoon aboard his tour bus, did he leave southern Georgia for the big city? I know why I left, I said — I never especially liked it there to begin with. What was his excuse? He hesitated. We were now in Springfield, Ill., and the ground outside was unmanageably muddy. Taking pity on my tennis shoes, he had lent me a pair of his boots. He seemed oblivious to the mud himself, stretching out his own grimy pair on the black leather couch lining the wood-paneled interior of the bus. He kept running a hand through his disheveled hair, where a backward ball cap should have been, as if he were feeling for a phantom limb. “I’m interesting in that, at any point, I could have taken the slightest deviation and never moved to Nashville,” he said. “And I think I would have still been smiling through every day. I would have been fine working at my dad’s peanut mill.” His father ran not only a peanut mill but also a fertilizer-chemical company and, along with a partner, was responsible for 3,000 acres of farmland. His mother — who had joined him for the tour, posting up in a lawn chair outside his bus and chain-smoking Salems — worked for the county utilities department. The youngest of three siblings, Bryan sang in his church choir as a teenager and led a praise band on Wednesday nights. On Fridays, he would be down the street playing at bars, often to the same crowd. “I would play a David Allan Coe song, and then I’d do a gospel medley of ‘I Saw the Light’ and ‘Amazing Grace,’ ” he said. “And people would be like, ‘Don’t you feel weird playing those songs in a honky-tonk?’ And I’d say: ‘Well, I don’t know. Would Jesus feel weird walking into a honky-tonk?’ ” Bryan had long planned on moving to Nashville, but a year after graduating from Georgia Southern University with a business degree, he was still in his hometown, pulling peanut wagons for a living. “My dad felt like he needed to nudge me a little out of the nest,” he said, and so the elder Bryan threatened to fire his son, who finally moved to Nashville in late 2001. After a few months of waiting on tables, he was put on contract by a publishing company to write tracks for other artists. In 2005, he met the songwriter Jeff Stevens, who had written hits for George Strait and Tim McGraw and immediately recognized Bryan’s potential as a performer. He produced Bryan’s 2007 debut, “I’ll Stay Me,” which reached No.2 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and scored a modest hit with “All My Friends Say,” sung from the perspective of a man piecing together a drunken blackout — presaging the college-bro image that would come to define his sound. But otherwise, his first release was relatively traditional, with lots of fiddle and mandolin; Bryan now calls it “country as cornbread” and says it’s slightly embarrassing for him to listen to. What you might not guess from his music is that Bryan’s life has been marked by tragedy. His older brother, Chris, was killed in a car accident in 1996, and his older sister, Kelly, died of uncertain causes in 2007 while doing the laundry. (Her husband, Ben Lee Cheshire, died in 2014; Bryan and his wife, Caroline, took in their three children.) It occurred to me to wonder, given the contours of his life, why Bryan’s music wasn’t sadder, and so I asked him. “I’ve written some sad songs,” he said. “There are 10 or 15 songs I’ve got that will break you down, like gut-punch you.” But these more personal songs, he said, have never felt right for his albums. “I don’t know if they — if they ever show up, they show up,” he said. He has claimed that his 2013 hit “Drink a Beer” is a sort of tribute to his siblings. But Bryan didn’t write the song himself, and there’s something vaguely disheartening about his linking these very real calamities of life to such a trite premise: Faced with the loss of a loved one, a man shrugs it off and cracks open a cold one. Sitting in the front seat of Jeff Stevens’s pickup truck one evening on the tour, I asked him what he thought of the criticism Bryan has taken over the course of his career: that he mostly sings about his truck and bluejeans and boots, that he’s shallow or opportunistic. Stevens, who has worked with Bryan on all his albums, sat back and laughed. “I love it,” he said. Whenever he sees Bryan perform, he went on, “I look over a sea of people who are forgetting everything. And that is the biggest gift that we can give to somebody — an hour and a half where they haven’t thought about their job, they haven’t thought about their troubles. They’re just here for pure fun. I personally feel that purely fun music is cathartic. It’s like being a goddamn doctor. And it’s important. I’m not saying that it’s not important to have a message — a message is great. But people love to not think in today’s world. They got enough to think about. When they go back to their cars, they’ll start thinking again.” One afternoon, angling his head out of his tour-bus bathroom while urinating, Bryan asked me about my political beliefs. I admitted that they were somewhat to the left of his own, and had been even back in Albany. He expressed surprise but said: “That’s the beauty of getting out of where we’re from. I lean conservative, but when you truly see the world and the country in its entirety, I think if you stay so conservative, it’s almost a little ignorant.” His musical trajectory is closely tied to his personal one. “When I was a 12-year-old kid,” he said, “I was so country, I would’ve probably had to have an interpreter for this interview.” But seeing the world had changed his perspective on things. He had evolved as a person, and his views — both artistic and political — had developed accordingly. Country singers aren’t often thought of as having the ability to change. They’re supposed to be reactionary and creatively static, to play the role that was written for them decades ago. Their continued cultural relevance can baffle observers unfamiliar with the form. In the early 1990s, when Billboard started using Nielsen SoundScan to more accurately calculate music’s commercial performance, one of the biggest surprises to industry insiders was the extraordinary popularity and reach of artists like Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson and Tim McGraw. Disdain for country music is as old as the genre itself, and appropriately, mainstream critics have disliked Bryan from the beginning and have tended to treat him with some combination of amusement and animosity. But Bryan — with his references to Drake and T-Pain and to the size of his rims, his occasional tendency to break out into rapping onstage, the smooth R&B production of his ballads — has also become an avatar of a deep fissure within country music and the object of the undying enmity of traditionalists. The commercial dominance of Bryan and his peers — artists like Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton and Florida Georgia Line — has often led Nashville’s more critically acclaimed Americana wing, which includes artists like Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell and Kacey Musgraves, to distance themselves from identifying with country altogether. (Musgraves has said, “My favorite compliment ever is when someone says, ‘I hate country music, but I love your music.’ ”) Bryan defends his own approach as a fundamentally generous and populist one. “Listen, at the end of the day,” he told me, “I write, record and sing about what I see my fans reacting to. If I roll into a concert and I tell everyone I have written the world’s greatest song, and I walk out there and play it and nobody really gives a [expletive] about it, it ain’t the world’s greatest song anymore. That’s how I go about it. I am not stubborn enough.” I asked Bryan about Sturgill Simpson, who won this year’s Grammy for best country album (Bryan has never been nominated) and has been an outspoken opponent of the Nashville establishment. Did it frustrate him that critics often focused their attentions on artists whose fans actively dislike most contemporary country? Bryan shrugged. “I’ve wanted to go have coffee with Sturgill,” he said. “I am utterly amazed at what he does.” (I asked Simpson to comment for this article, and he responded quickly by email: “I don’t know Luke, I don’t think about Luke, and I’ve honestly never heard a single note of his music.”) Simpson’s retro purity and projection of artistic integrity may win him awards and make him palatable to country outsiders, but Bryan’s omnivorous approach to country production is arguably more ambitious and musically progressive; it’s certainly more in tune with the genre’s younger listeners. Bryan’s own epiphany in this respect arrived in his early years on the road, when he noticed D.J.s playing hip-hop immediately after his sets and noticed too that his fans were happy to hear it. That taught him, he told me, that “it’s not always all about the twangiest of the twang” and that a hybrid like “Country Girl (Shake It for Me)” could be accepted. Others picked up on this as well, from Florida Georgia Line to Sam Hunt — from the lowbrow, in other words, to the ostensibly cosmopolitan — and this kind of stylistic flexibility has become one of the dominant narratives of pop-country in recent years. These days, Bryan said with a laugh, “all my nieces and nephews are listening to Future.” Kids no longer make the same hard-and-fast genre distinctions as their parents. So why should he? (Up to a point; he told me tries to keep his albums “80 percent country.”) But Bryan remains well aware of his responsibilities to his base; country has always been primarily a white, blue-collar music. Which is why the fascinating quandary of his career has been the question of how much he can tweak the country sound — how much sonic and thematic borrowing the genre can sustain — while still remaining identifiably country. Paradoxically, in a deep-historical sense, to do so is to be more faithful to country’s roots than the nostalgists. “From its inception,” Nick Tosches wrote in “Country: The Biggest Music in America,” his classic history of the genre, “country and western was as mongrelized a style as any of earth,” describing its origins as an amalgamation of blues and jazz, minstrel comedy, yodeling, Tin Pan Alley and Hawaiian slide guitar. Bryan, along with the artists who have emerged in his wake, are proof that this is still the case, that country is still mutable, still in flux. If you’re wondering whether the results are cynical or forward-thinking, the answer is that they’re both — they’re also pretty fun. Bryan’s form of genre fluidity doesn’t, however, seem to be actually diversifying the country audience: His crowds, like the genre’s fans over all, are overwhelmingly white. Bryan’s relationship to the rural working class is at this point more imaginative than direct. What grounds him in the country ethos is largely a set of signifiers, those almost algorithmically predictable references to the trappings of heartland American life — to the right kinds of beer and trucks, to the primacy of, as one Bryan hit has it, “Huntin’, Fishin’ and Lovin’ Every Day.” When I asked Stevens what kept Bryan tethered to country music rather than to the broader pop arena, his answer was comical in its minimalism. “Have you heard him sing?” he asked, with a confused expression. “He’s a [expletive] hillbilly.” He went on: “We feel like we can do anything, and as long as you put that hillbilly voice on top of it, it’s going to sound country.” As a barometer of country identity, Bryan’s vision is a testament to its adaptability but also to its deep-rooted insularity. Say the right things in the right accent, and Stevens is right: Country can be anything. Advertisement",2017-12-06 05:00:01,Feature: What Makes Luke Bryan Country?,,1,http://nytimes.com

Tustin resident/attorney Rachael, 39, is up to something interesting. Her father Mark, who died at 65 two years ago, was the lead guitarist in a 1975 Broadway play, “The New Lieutenant,” a “Hair”-like rock musical about the Mai Lai Massacre in Vietnam. The play was nominated for several Tonys, but did not last long — perhaps because audiences weren’t ready for a play about Vietnam. Rachael thinks the time is right now and wants to revive the play, starting in Southern Calif. and eventually getting it back on Broadway. Some of the original cast members and writers are involved.

(Photo by Mindy Schauer, Orange County Register/SCNG)    What will you remember most about this waning year? Take a walk down memory lane. Here are some of the highlights of Tustin’s 2017… January The year started out with a bang as Americans witnessed Donald Trump’s inauguration after the surprise ending of the 2016 presidential election. In Tustin, a festive group of fans gathered under rainy skies in the courtyard behind Kelly’s Hair Design to savor Trump’s speech. The revelers celebrated their victory over doughnuts and Bloody Marys. Arlyn Pillay, 35, owner of an art gallery on Newport Avenue, was fatally shot with his mother inside their family home. Pillay’s brother was charged with two counts of murder. The respected artist was known for opening his gallery free of charge for musicians, comedians and other artists to display their creativity. February Political protests rumbled throughout the country, including some close to home. Sign-carrying Tustin residents joined other constituents of U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters as regulars outside her Irvine office to demand face-to-face meetings about health care, immigration and other issues. Bravo, a familiar face at community events, retired after six years of service with the Tustin Police Department. Over his career, the Belgian Malinois assisted in dozens of arrests and narcotics finds. Bravo will live out his life with his handler, Officer Rene Barraza. A youngster named Kingsley replaced him. March Tustin Library suddenly closed after a maintenance worker discovered water leaking from a pipe underneath the library’s floor, in a space that houses electrical wires. Nine months later, the main part of the library remains shuttered. Council members recently voted to begin taking bids for repairs to the building, which the city rents to OC Public Libraries. April Tustin residents who died in war have been honored throughout the year on the anniversaries of their deaths. Donna Peery, who heads up the Patriots & Pioneer program for the Tustin Community Foundation, organized ceremonies at each of 18 streets in the Tustin Ranch neighborhood named after local heroes. The family of Allen DuRoy, who 46 years before died in Vietnam, gathered at DuRoy Court for a service that featured a procession by American Legion Post 227 and a bugle player performing Taps. Family members were unaware of the street name, adopted in 1991, before Peery contacted them. The Tustin Police Department became one of a handful of departments in Orange County to offer a Spanish Citizens’ Academy, an offshoot of its 20-year program that focuses on public safety. “It is important to gain people’s trust and let them know we are committed to a partnership,” said Officer Diego Gomez, who spearheaded the Spanish-language program’s debut. May After Tustin Unified was threatened with a lawsuit claiming that its at-large voting system dilutes minorities’ voices, the school board voted to elect its five members by district. The City Council voted to limit city commissioners to two four-year terms. Tustin has three commissions with five members each: The Planning Commission, the Community Services Commission and the Audit Commission. Over the years, the council often has re-approved commissioners still interested in the job without soliciting other candidates. June Tustin attorney Rachael Cianfrani’s late father played lead guitar in “The Lieutenant,” a 1975 Broadway rock opera based on the My Lai Massacre of South Vietnamese civilians by American soldiers. The short-lived but critically acclaimed musical garnered three Tony nominations. With the help of the play’s co-writers, Cianfrani is now trying to attract backers for a “Lieutenant” revival — launching that mission with a gala preview. July Faced with potential litigation, Tustin Unified board members approved a by-trustee map to replace district-wide elections. Starting in the 2018 election, board members will run within precincts according to their home addresses. Civil rights advocates argue that at-large elections can violate the California Voters Rights Act. After an encampment of 22 homeless people developed in the Civic Center courtyard, frustrated Tustin residents took turns at the podium in a four-hour city workshop. A week later, Tustin police officers posted signs in the courtyard telling inhabitants they must vacate within two weeks to make way for a temporary library. “Whatever you feel about the encampment, it’s a human tragedy,” then-Mayor Allan Bernstein said. August With the assistance of community organizer TyRon Jackson and the Orange County Rescue Mission, every homeless person living at the Tustin Civic Center cleared out before the city’s Aug. 7 deadline — averting arrests and other problems. “We have been working 10 hours a day —  packing up belongings, tracking down family members, driving people to shelters and doing whatever we can do to facilitate their move,” Jackson said. One week after homeless people moved out of the Civic Center courtyard, it became a temporary library to stand in while the main building undergoes repairs from water damage. The outdoor space offers children’s programs under a 900-square-foot tarp. Visitors can choose from a limited supply of books inside a room off the courtyard. September Following Irvine’s lead, the Tustin City Council voted to test an “organics first” program at two parks, Cedar Grove and Columbus Tustin. Irvine became the first Orange County city to adopt a landscaping and pest control policy that allows synthetic pesticides only as a last resort. “The time has come to make this happen,” said Councilman Chuck Puckett. As the city celebrated its 90th anniversary, local history buff Guy Ball shared charming photos of Tustin through the ages. October When a bullet pierced Mykenzie Lane’s foot during the tragic mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas, she called her mom — even as she and her boyfriend were still running for safety. Fortunately, the Foothill High graduate’s injury was not life-threatening. “People were falling all around us,” recalled Lane, 21.  “I didn’t know if they were hit or were ducking. There was nowhere to hide.” A Tustin landmark of sorts, Al’s Woodcraft closed shop after looming over the 5 Freeway at Red Hill Avenue for more than 50 years. A year after the death of owner Bill Mathis, his children decided to sell the 16,000-square-foot warehouse where they had worked throughout their adult lives. “You can wind up with weird bosses,” said daughter Donna Eisler. “This is way easier. Dad was a good boss.” Council members approved a ban on smoking in city parks that covers tobacco, electronic cigarettes and marijuana. Girl Scout Troop 3562 made the ordinance their mission for their Bronze Award project. After collecting hundreds of cigarette butts in Tustin parks, the young activists presented their research to the City Council. November Several weeks after residents lined up at a Planning Commission hearing to denounce a mental health crisis clinic under consideration, St. Joseph Hospital of Orange retracted the proposal. City staff and the Tustin Police Department had supported the outpatient clinic, at the corner of Irvine Boulevard and Newport Avenue, saying it would provide a safe and efficient way for officers to assist people suffering mental illness emergencies. But residents worried the facility would attract homeless people. On Black Friday, The District at Tustin Legacy debuted its Freeze Ice Rink — Orange County’s largest outdoor ice skating rink, at 50-feet by 100-feet. The rink will remain open through Jan. 15. December After some 285 “flights,” George Vallevieni steered Santa’s sleigh for the last time this December. Soon to retire from the Tustin Police Department, Vallevieni will turn over the reins to another pilot. He started the community outreach tradition in 1998, when he attached an antique sleigh to a trailer and carved seven wooden reindeer to “pull” it. Ever since, Vallevieni has spent every weeknight before Christmas tugging Santa through the 11-square-mile city.     Get the latest news delivered daily!

Fortunately, he is now OK. I belong to a religious congregation of around 35 families. One of the women in my congregation and I are also part of another (affiliated) group. At a meeting of the group, I mentioned the shooting to this woman. She said I should contact the president of the organization. I received much warmth and support from members of this group. The president sent a memo to the entire religious congregation -- I know this because I am on the email list. What happened next? Nothing! Not one person contacted me to see if he was OK, if I was OK, etc. I am very hurt. Part of me wants to just silently quit the congregation. Part of me wants to tell them how hurt I was (even though shooting off my mouth has gotten me trouble all during my life), and then quit the congregation, and part of me wants to carry on like nothing happened. Your advice? -- Troubled Dear Troubled: You should reach out to your clergy member regarding your concern. Say that your family has been through a frightening, dramatic and traumatic event, and that you would appreciate support during this challenging time. Be frank and respectful with clergy when you describe your disappointment, even after this email went out. This is very much a pastoral matter, and your clergy should explain why your needs have been neglected, thus far. This monstrous gunman killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others, many of whom are still trying to recover. You might take this opportunity to inspire the congregation not only to care more fully about you, but to extend their compassion to the scores of other family members affected by this senseless tragedy. After you talk with clergy, you might inspire the congregation by sharing the opportunity to donate to the Music City Cares Fund, established by the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee (cfmt.org). This highly rated foundation has pledged that 100 percent of donations made to the Music City Cares Fund will go directly to families impacted by the worst mass shooting in modern American history. You don't say what your faith practice is, but you should consider the possibility that many of them have lifted up private thoughts to you. The test for you is to see if you can get what you need by asking for it (instead of ""shooting your mouth off""). I hope your faith community rises to this simple challenge with compassion. Dear Amy: My wife is a very opinionated person. She has no social filters. On her son's (my stepson's) wedding day, she began drinking, etc., in mid-morning, along with some of the others in the bridal party. Without going into explicit detail, I learned after the fact that my wife took the bride aside just before she was due to walk down the aisle, and said she didn't believe that the bride really loved her son, but was only marrying him for his money. In the days following the wedding my wife confirmed those feelings to me, yet, now, (weeks later) she denies ever saying those words to the bride. Apparently, though, at least one other person overheard and confirmed what was said, and shared this with the groom. Understandably, the newlyweds don't want anything to do with my wife, and I'm left trying to mend fences. Thoughts? -- Mending Dear Mending: In the unlikely event of the couple coming to you and asking for reconciliation, you should dive in and try to bring all parties together, in person, to talk this out. Otherwise, you should continue to tell your wife that she owes her daughter-in-law (and son) an apology, preferably in writing. What she did was unconscionable. I hope it wasn't unforgivable. Your wife has a big problem. No filter plus alcohol plus denial equals unhappy ending. Dear Amy: Recently you have included letters from people who have cancer and parts of your responses were along the lines that it looked like they would beat it. As you know, everybody does not survive cancer and I don't think this is appropriate coming from you, rather than their medical team. -- Concerned Dear Concerned: I am applauding those who write to share that their treatment seems to be working. For many, cancer is becoming a chronic disease. None of us survives this life. And cancer exacts a terrible toll, but I believe that this is fairly common knowledge.

203,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/20/colourblind-casting-hamilton-west-end-debut,"The racially diverse musical based on America’s founding fathers loses none of its power in its transfer from Broadway Last modified on Thu 7 Jan 2021 00.03 GMT Since Hamilton debuted in New York in 2015, the hip-hop musical, which transferred to the West End in London this month, has been breaking the conventions of musical theatre with award-winning abandon. There was the subject matter: the story of America’s least well-known founding father Alexander Hamilton; and the music: a fusion of rap, hip-hop and classic theatrical numbers. And, controversially, there was the diverse cast, with young black, Asian, Latino and mixed-race actors portraying the old white founding fathers and their cohorts.  January 2015 Hamilton, a new musical written by and starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, has its first performances off-Broadway at the Public theater in New York. Its subject is the US founding father who was the first secretary of the Treasury. February 2015 As the show opens officially, it wins praise from critics, particularly for its innovative blend of musical styles, from rap to operetta. In her four-star review, the Guardian’s Alexis Soloski calls the show ""brash, nimble, historically engaged and startlingly contemporary"". August 2015 After selling out its run at the Public, the show opens on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers theatre and there is huge demand for tickets. February 2016 The original Broadway cast recording wins a Grammy award for best musical theatre album. March 2016 Miranda visits the White House to perform songs from the musical and a video of him freestyling in the Rose Garden with President Barack Obama goes viral. First lady Michelle Obama calls the show “the best piece of art in any form that I have ever seen in my life”. April 2016 Hamilton wins the Pulitzer prize for drama. June 2016 The musical breaks records, winning 11 Tony awards – at a ceremony that takes place after news breaks of a mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. Miranda performs a sonnet in praise of his wife and son, ending with the words: “Now fill the world with music, love and pride.” July 2016 Miranda stops performing in the show to pursue other opportunities, including starring in a sequel to Mary Poppins. A spoof version of the musical, Spamilton, opens in New York. October 2016 A production of Hamilton opens in Chicago and runs concurrently with the Broadway version. November 2016 Vice-president-elect Mike Pence sees the show in New York. From the stage, actor Brandon Victor Dixon addresses him directly, saying: “We are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us.” On Twitter, Donald Trump condemns their “terrible behaviour” and says he hears the show is “highly overrated”. January 2017 The first cast members are revealed for a West End production of Hamilton. December 2017 The show opens to five-star reviews at the newly renovated Victoria Palace theatre in London. March 2018 The London production of Hamilton gets 13 Olivier nominations, making it the most nominated show in the history of the awards. July 2020 A filmed version of the Broadway production debuts on the Disney+ streaming service, warmly welcomed while the world is still in lockdown over the coronavirus crisis. In an interview with the Guardian, the director of Hamilton, Thomas Kail, said there was “no question” the multiracial casting would also be at the core of the UK version, which officially opens on 21 December. “We never imagined casting the show in any other way – never for one second,” he said. “We are very conscious of what we are doing here. This is not colour-blind casting. It felt essential.” Kail’s relationship with Hamilton’s celebrated writer, Lin-Manuel Miranda, began in 2005 when he directed Miranda’s debut, the musical In The Heights. He was also one of the first to witness the origins of Hamilton, which began as a single song in 2009. With Kail’s encouragement, the song grew into a 10-track mixtape and eventually spawned an ambitious 46-song musical. Hamilton might begin in 1776, but Kail said he and Miranda always intended for the show to feel relevant, holding up a mirror to society. In the original production, Miranda, who is of Puerto Rican descent, played Hamilton; in London, Jamael Westman, born to an Irish mother and Jamaican father, takes on the role. In the stubbornly white world of British theatre, which remains a long way off from regularly casting black and minority ethnic actors in roles long-played by their white counterparts, Hamilton makes a powerful statement. “When we started casting this in 2011, we didn’t know the subjects that would be dominating headlines in 2017,” Kail said, when asked whether the simmering racial tensions in America over the past couple of years had made the casting choices feel more pointed. “What I knew is that I wanted this show to live in the tension of emotions that felt very contemporary. I wanted to eliminate any distance between then and now. And I just knew the best way to serve this story was exactly how Lin wanted to serve this story, which is that this show should have a cast which reflects the world we live in.” Hamilton addresses revolution, political partisanship and mudslinging, immigration and questions of belonging – issues still making headlines. Kail admits he did not appreciate how relevant the production’s themes would feel in 2017. “We had no idea,” he said. “All you can do is try to react to the moments that exist in front of you. But back in 2009, when Lin wrote the first song, there was no Brexit, there was no Trump and there was no knowledge of what would happen.” One of the show’s most popular lines with US and UK audiences is “immigrants, we get the job done”, which is greeted with a raucous cry of support every night. Kail refuses to be drawn into whether events such as Donald Trump’s racially divisive presidency and the UK’s withdrawal from the EU make Hamilton feel ever more vital and political. “All I know is that the show feels different from one day to the next,” he said. “The news cycle is such that it is so fast-moving that lines that never really resonated or had a weight to them, all of a sudden emerge. “But that’s a testament to the specificity of Lin’s writing, because the words have always been the same for the last few years, but we are different and the world is different, so people just interact with it in a different way. There’s no one thing we want people to take from it; there’s no one message of the show.” Though it has been around for only two years, Hamilton has established itself as one of the biggest stage shows of the century. The announcement that it would make its first international transfer to London was met with a buzz that exceeded any previous production – tickets sold out instantly and resell for more than £3,000. Hamilton originated as a single song inspired by Miranda’s reading of a biography on the founding father. Composed in 2009, My Shot was first performed during a visit to the White House. It wasn’t until Kail watched the song being performed to an audience at a New York benefit gig in a small theatre in 2012, that he experienced his “thunderclap moment”. “I saw the audience just quivering. You could feel the hairs on the backs of everyone’s necks was standing up – it really felt like something amazing was happening,” Kail said. “It was a thunderclap moment because I realised there was a version of this that could be done live. I didn’t know what it looked like, I didn’t know what it was going to be, but I knew Lin had to keep writing.” Even then he did not realise the pair had discovered a groundbreaking formula, spawning a show that would go on sweep the Tony awards and win a Pulitzer prize. “All I knew was that it was the best thing that Lin had written, and the best thing that Lin has written is something to be reckoned with,” Kail said. During the show’s transfer from Broadway to the West End, Kail and Miranda did not take the easy route. Instead of casting experienced actors in the meatiest roles, they spent almost a year seeking newcomers. The pair announced – to the surprise of many – that a recent drama school graduate would star as Hamilton. Yet, according to Kail, it was not an impressive CV they were looking for but bravery. And when Westman walked in “we could just sense it”. “He just filled the room and nothing frightened him,” he added. “And to play Hamilton, what you need above all is fearlessness.” This article was amended on 21 December 2017. An earlier version said that one of the most popular lines in the show was “immigrants, they get the job done”. This has been corrected to say “immigrants, we get the job done”.",2017-12-20 12:50:41,‘This isn't colour-blind casting’: Hamilton makes its politically charged West End debut,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Filed under: Not a good year for humanity, but a great year for books If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. 2017 was a hard year for a lot of people. With climate change, haywire politics, and tech companies running amok, there are lots of reasons to put the year in the rearview mirror. But through it all, a run of great books shined a light in the darkness. They built off and commented on the issues that dominated the year, going beyond mere escapism to provide thoughtful, damning, and entertaining reads to keep us sane. Here are the best books of 2017. In the near future, teenage girls begin spontaneously developing electrical powers, thanks to a small muscle called the ""skein"" that's found only in women. The girls wake up the power in others, and the world undergoes a revolution, as women gain brash confidence with their newfound strength. Naomi Alderman is a protégé of Margaret Atwood, and her latest book is often compared to Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. But where The Handmaid's Tale casts real-world misogyny in a harsh dystopian light, The Power exposes power hierarchies that we take for granted by reversing them. It’s a quick read that nonetheless feels like a sea change in modern feminist science fiction. Reinterpreted folklore is popular in fantasy literature, and Katherine Arden’s debut novel is a great example of the genre. Arden turned her fascination with Russia’s folk tales into a powerful novel about the power of faith, set during the depths of a medieval Russian winter. In The Bear and the Nightingale, Vanya Petrova has a particular gift: she can see the fantastical creatures that inhabit her home and village. But she finds herself trapped between the ancient, pagan traditions, and the more modern religion of Christianity. Those crossroads present a danger to her community, as an ancient evil begins to reawaken from its long slumber. Medieval Europe dominates fantasy settings, but for The City of Brass, S.A. Chakraborty looks to the Middle East for inspiration. In 18th-century Cairo, streetwise orphan Nahri cons wealthy Ottoman tourists to survive. She doesn’t believe that magic is real, until she accidentally summons a djinn, steps into a conflict in a fantastical world, and discovers that she is the last remaining member of a powerful family. Chakraborty masterfully sketches a world in turmoil, where factions of magic users are working to reclaim power, affected by generations of oppression and racism. Now in its seventh installment, The Expanse series stays fresh by jumping forward three decades with Persepolis Rising. Earlier in the series, a faction from Mars vanished to a new world, shunning any attempts at contact. They’ve now returned, in a manner reminiscent of Germany’s invasion of France during World War II, with plans to seize control of humanity. The series’ familiar heroes are among the few willing to resist the new threat, as the series prepares to enter its final arc. Related Persepolis Rising puts a new spin on a familiar world, while keeping elements that made longtime readers fall in love with The Expanse, and examining humanity’s tendency toward authoritarianism. In a year where Universal Studios essentially abandoned its big-budget monster movie universe, Theodora Goss’s debut novel is a nice reminder that mashup stories can be fantastic adventures. Related The Strange Case of the Alchemist's Daughter brings together the fictional daughters (or creations) of famous characters like Victor Frankenstein, Doctor Moreau, Abraham Van Helsing, and Giacomo Rappaccini, who are part of a secret society called Société des Alchimistes. The women band together to solve a series of murders, while making sense of their origins, and the way they’ve been affected by their fathers’ bizarre experiments. It’s a critical look at the treatment of female characters in those original literary works, and a fun mystery at the same time. Known for sprawling novels such as NOS4A2 or The Fireman, Joe Hill has carved out a name for himself as one of the most promising horror writers working today. His latest book is a bit different from his others: rather than one massive story, Strange Weather is four short, pointed novels. Related In one story, a mall cop tries to cover up a mistake during a mass shooting. In another, the sky rains razor-sharp nails of crystal — shredding everyone unlucky enough to be caught outside. The stories span topics as diverse as climate change, gun violence, cell phones, and pure existential horror, resulting in a book that’s positively addictive. The private space industry made strides in 2017 — SpaceX conducted 18 separate launches, as Elon Musk provided updates on his ambitions for colonizing Mars. So it’s an excellent time for Meg Howrey’s novel The Wanderers, which is about the preparations for a fictional commercial mission to Mars. Related Howrey’s astronauts aren’t actually headed into space yet — they’re conducting an extensive simulation of the mission to determine how people will function through such an extended trip. And it’s not just the astronauts who are tested by their work: their families back home face their own hardships because of the mission. The book is an elegant look at the toll that space exploration could extract from the people involved. I don’t think I’ve ever read a book like Kameron Hurley’s The Stars are Legion — a bold, unapologetic space opera set on a series of dying world-ships populated entirely by women. Related Hurley’s narrator Zan awakes to discover that she’s missing many of her memories, and that she’s a pawn in a larger power struggle between factions on two of the worlds. As her characters journey through the depths of one of the organic ships, Hurley challenges her readers as she subverts space opera’s traditional tropes and conventions. Fantasy author N.K. Jemisin has earned considerable acclaim for her Broken Earth trilogy, which concluded this year with The Stone Sky. Set in a far-future, post-apocalyptic society, humanity is perpetually on the verge of being wiped out through mass extinction events known as “seasons.” Related Bringing the trilogy home, after her brilliant books The Fifth Season and The Obelisk Gate, was a tall order — but Jemisin did it. She places the reader behind the eyes of the characters and touches on themes of oppression, marginalization, and enslavement as they journey across the broken landscape, in a desperate attempt to end the cycles of destruction. In 2149, humanity has established a network of colonies on the Moon. One such colony is the Society of Cousins, a matriarchal settlement in which men are disenfranchised, urged to focus on personal pursuits such as the arts or sports. But there’s unrest — not everyone is happy with the status quo, and the Moon’s governing body, the Organization of Lunar States, sends out a team to investigate. Related Kessel’s beautifully written novel follows four characters caught up in this society: an exiled businessman and his ambitious wife, a protest artist, and an athlete. Each of their stories intertwine as he examines the role that gender plays in society, and how political ideals are translated into a viable civilization — as well as what it takes to change those ideals. Cyberpunk has come a long way since its origins in the 1980s. Zachary Mason’s new novel Void Star takes all of the conventions of the subgenre — massive corporations, newfangled technology, and conspiracies — and puts a literary spin on them. Related Void Star is set in a world filled with AIs, where the super-wealthy find ways to extend their lives indefinitely. Readers follow Irina Sunden, a freelance contractor who sees something that she shouldn’t, and is pulled into a wider conspiracy. Mason uses the book to look at our relationship with the technological world around us, and how little we understand it. Joe M. McDermott’s short novel is built around a technology called the ansible, which can send a copy of a human being across the universe. Captain Ronaldo Aldo is transmitted to a base called the Citadel at the far end of the galaxy, and has to come to terms with an isolated, lonely existence, with little hope of being transmitted to a better post. Related McDermott explores the downsides to fantastic technologies in this multilayered and thoughtful novel. Aldo aspires to a new life, but is frozen in place, not wanting to burden his future copy with his anxieties and longing for loved ones in his present life. It’s a fantastic throwback to some of science fiction’s classic authors, such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Frank Herbert. Last year, Ian McDonald released the fantastic Luna: New Moon, kicking off a trilogy about power struggles between family corporations on the Moon in 2110. It ended with the near-complete elimination of a family called Corta, and in Luna: Wolf Moon, McDonald depicts the efforts of the survivors to exact revenge. The trilogy has been compared to George R.R. Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire, with brutal dynastic warfare playing out across the Moon, and McDonald is no less ruthless with his characters. Fortunately, we don’t have long to wait for the final installment of the trilogy, Luna: Moon Rising — it’s out next spring. Linda Nagata wrote the The Red trilogy, some of my absolute favorite books about the future of warfare. With The Last Good Man, she returns to the topic — though not the same world — to explore what combat might look like five minutes into the future. Related The result is pretty scary. Private military corporations use the latest tech to carry out combat missions — from tiny robots that delivery neurotoxins to enemy combatants, to heavily armed drones that can take out vehicles from miles way, to lasers that have a devastating effect on their targets. Nagata’s future feels frighteningly close at hand. Annalee Newitz made her name as a science and technology journalist, and her debut novel extrapolates from modern-day issues around intellectual property, artificial intelligence, and pharmaceutical research. It follows two characters who are pitted against each other: patent pirate Judith “Jack” Chen, and robotic intellectual property enforcer Paladin, both of whom are trying to stop the spread of a drug that gets users literally addicted to work. Related True to its name, Autonomous is about freedom — from personal servitude, exploitative economic systems, robotic programming, and many other things. It’s a fast-paced book that feels both freewheeling and carefully composed. 17 years ago, Philip Pullman published the final installment of the His Dark Materials trilogy. In the years since, he’s worked on a companion book — which turned into a trilogy — called The Book of Dust. The first volume, La Belle Sauvage, is a long-overdue return to Pullman’s world. Related Where his original trilogy tackled issues like consciousness and morality on a universe-sized stage, the author takes a more grounded approach here. La Belle Sauvage is all about the rise of religious authoritarianism, and the small things that people do to resist fascist ideology and its leaders. Digging into Kim Stanley Robinson’s novel New York 2140 was a revelation. Through the intertwining lives of many different characters, he highlights what he deems a primary driver of climate change: not carbon emissions, but unfettered capitalism. Related Robinson’s books are wonderful exercises in world-building, and he extrapolates what rising sea levels will do to New York City. There’s some devastation, but people pick up their lives and continue onwards. Rather than being a depressing lecture on where we’re headed, the book is surprisingly funny and optimistic. R.E. Stearns’ debut novel may be the most fun thing I’ve read this year. Engineers Adda and Iridian board an abandoned space station to join a pirate crew, but find more than they’ve bargained for: a homicidal AI is trying to kill everyone on the station, and won’t let anyone escape. Related Stearns goes beyond boilerplate space adventure. She sets up a well-realized world plagued by corporate excess and the fallout of a devastating civil war, and explores the nature of intelligence through the homocidal security AI AegiSKADA. It’s a unique portrayal that runs counter to what most people imagine when they think of malevolent artificial intelligence. Brian Staveley finished his fantastic Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne trilogy, but wasn’t done with the world he created. Skullsworn is a standalone entry in the world, unveiling the origins of one of the characters we met in earlier novels. That character is Pyrre Lakatur, a priestess of a murderous cult. To finish her trials, she needs to kill seven people in ten days, including someone she loves. Staveley’s novel is an exciting addition to his world, but he uses the opportunity to explore the nature of civil unrest and the power that myths and stories hold for a repressed people. There are plenty of books, television shows and movies about the dangers of intelligent, malevolent robots bent on destroying humanity. In All Systems Red, Martha Wells flips that script as she kicked off a new series called The Murderbot Diaries. The book introduces readers to a cranky security robot that just wants to be left alone. Related All Systems Red is a short read, and it feels a bit like a pilot to a larger, ongoing story. (The next installment, Artificial Condition, comes out in May.) The titular robot is tasked with protecting a scientific expedition when a nearby team goes missing. This is a little ironic, since it killed the people it was designed to protect on another planet. Wells uses the story as a parable about robotic bondage and freedom, and it’s a fascinating, new take on the nature of artificial intelligence. Mainstream audiences discovered Jeff Vandermeer through the Southern Reach trilogy, a surreal exploration of the strangeness of the natural world. In his latest novel Borne, Vandermeer looks at the nature vs. nurture argument when a woman named Rachel discovers a blob that grows in size and intelligence at an incredible rate. Related As Rachel ekes out a meager living in the midst of a biotech-filled, post-apocalyptic city, Vandermeer plays out a struggle between its various inhabitants, and examines how power corrupts. There are other big themes at play: Rachel’s case for the creature Borne, and the consequences of a company’s wasteful attitude towards the life that it created.

On her son’s (my stepson’s) wedding day, she began drinking, etc., in midmorning, along with some of the others in the bridal party. Without going into explicit detail, I learned after the fact that my wife took the bride aside just before she was due to walk down the aisle, and said she didn’t believe that the bride really loved her son but was only marrying him for his money.

In the days following the wedding my wife confirmed those feelings to me, yet, now (weeks later) she denies ever saying those words to the bride. Apparently, though, at least one other person overheard and confirmed what was said, and shared this with the groom. Understandably, the newlyweds don’t want anything to do with my wife, and I’m left trying to mend fences. Thoughts? Mending DEAR MENDING: In the unlikely event of the couple coming to you and asking for reconciliation, you should dive in and try to bring all parties together, in person, to talk this out. Otherwise, you should continue to tell your wife that she owes her daughter-in-law (and son) an apology, preferably in writing. What she did was unconscionable. I hope it wasn’t unforgivable. Your wife has a big problem. No filter plus alcohol plus denial equals unhappy ending. (Click here if you are having trouble viewing the video on your mobile device.)

DEAR AMY: My son-in-law was shot in the thigh during the Las Vegas concert in October. Fortunately, he is now OK. I belong to a religious congregation of around 35 families. One of the women in my congregation and I are also part of another (affiliated) group. At a meeting of the group, I mentioned the shooting to this woman. She said I should contact the president of the organization. I received much warmth and support from members of this group. The president sent a memo to the entire religious congregation — I know this because I am on the email list. What happened next? Nothing! Not one person contacted me to see if he was OK, if I was OK, etc. I am very hurt. Part of me wants to just silently quit the congregation. Part of me wants to tell them how hurt I was (even though shooting off my mouth has gotten me trouble all during my life), and then quit the congregation, and part of me wants to carry on like nothing happened. Your advice? Troubled DEAR TROUBLED: You should reach out to your clergy member regarding your concern. Say that your family has been through a frightening, dramatic and traumatic event, and that you would appreciate support during this challenging time. Be frank and respectful with clergy when you describe your disappointment, even after this email went out. This is very much a pastoral matter, and your clergy should explain why your needs have been neglected, thus far. This monstrous gunman killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others, many of whom are still trying to recover. You might take this opportunity to inspire the congregation not only to care more fully about you, but to extend their compassion to the scores of other family members affected by this senseless tragedy. After you talk with clergy, you might inspire the congregation by sharing the opportunity to donate to the “Music City Cares Fund,” established by the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee (cfmt.org). This highly rated foundation has pledged that 100 percent of donations made to the Music City Cares Fund will go directly to families impacted by the worst mass shooting in American history. You don’t say what your faith practice is, but you should consider the possibility that many of them have lifted up private thoughts to you. The test for you is to see if you can get what you need by asking for it (instead of “shooting your mouth off”). I hope your faith community rises to this simple challenge with compassion. DEAR AMY: Recently you have included letters from people who have cancer and parts of your responses were along the lines that it looked like they would beat it. As you know, everybody does not survive cancer and I don’t think this is appropriate coming from you, rather than their medical team. Concerned DEAR CONCERNED: I am applauding those who write to share that their treatment seems to be working. For many, cancer is becoming a chronic disease. None of us survives this life.

206,http://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/04/why-the-workers-comp-system-has-failed-survivors-of-san-bernardino-terror-attack/,"Trending: Struggles endured by survivors of the Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino terrorist attack throw an unflattering spotlight on California’s workers’ compensation system and San Bernardino County. Changes in workers’ comp laws led to big savings for insurance companies, but made it difficult for injured workers to get the help they need. And the county “put dollars ahead of people” and showed “ignorance and a complete lack of empathy” by denying or delaying some treatment, said state Sens. Jeff Stone, R-Temecula, and Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara. The worker’s comp system just wasn’t designed to treat people injured in such attacks or other workplace violence. The survivors’ plight, which came to light a year ago, inspired newly elected Assemblywoman Eloise Reyes to introduce a bill to help them when she was sworn in Dec. 5, 2016.  “If we fail those employees and we can’t fix it, then we really have something wrong with the system,” said Reyes, D-Grand Terrace, who represents the 47th Assembly District. San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood declined to respond to those and other statements involving the handling of survivors’ workers’ comp claims. Under state workers’ compensation laws, when an employee is injured, the employer is required to immediately open a workers’ comp claim and send the employee for medical treatment. All California workers hurt on the job have a legal right to benefits including medical care, wage-loss compensation or temporary disability payments during recovery, vocational rehabilitation, death benefits and lost future earnings compensation or permanent disability payments, according to a state Legislative Analyst’s Office report. RELATED: How San Bernardino terror attack survivors are struggling with PTSD’s ‘invisible wounds’ 2 years later A crisis has evolved following legislative changes made in the past 10 to 15 years after the state’s insurance market deregulation in the 1990s led to insurance rate spikes. Employers pushed for legislative help, which included Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger introducing SB899 in 2004. Since that era, it’s been harder for employees to prove claims, medical treatments have been denied or delayed, and permanent disability compensation has dwindled. But it wasn’t until Dec. 2 survivors were shortchanged that the public and legislators took notice, said Santa Ana attorney Geraldine Ly, a workers’ comp law specialist for nearly 20 years who represents nine San Bernardino terror attack survivors. “It has gotten the legislators’ attention. Nothing like that has ever happened,” she said.  “While most would like to return to work, their permanent injuries prevent their return and have forced some, like Ray Britain, to medically retire from the county,” Geraldine Ly, workers’ comp attorney, says of her Dec. 2 survivor client at her Santa Ana office Thurs., Nov. 9. (Photo by Cindy Yamanaka, Orange County Register/SCNG)  Geraldine Ly’s Dec. 2 survivor clients have become friends. She pore through their files at her Santa Ana office Thurs., Nov. 9.

At left, survivor Julie Swann-Paez. (Photo courtesy of the Assembly Democratic Caucus)  Most employers buy workers’ comp insurance. San Bernardino County and others self-insure, setting aside reserves to cover costs. RELATED: Surgeries, therapy and pain: San Bernardino terror attack survivor details horrific journey to recovery Doctors treating workers must fill out forms to make written treatment requests for everything from surgery to physical therapy, medication or a special bed. The request for treatment is sent to a claims adjustor or “handler” — working for the insurer or employer’s risk management department — for approval. The adjuster can OK treatment or send the request to an outside company for utilization review when another physician weighs in. If the request is denied or modified, a worker can appeal to independent medical review. Many Dec. 2 survivors who weren’t shot in the attack by a Muslim co-worker and his wife didn’t learn they were entitled to trauma counseling, medication and other care under workers’ comp until Ly held an informational meeting in late January 2016. Some returned to work that month without counseling. That April, survivors began experiencing denials, delays and “modifications” or limits for surgeries, physical therapy, counseling, equipment and prescriptions, including painkillers, antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. The state Workers’ Compensation division reported the county routinely approved nearly all requests until mid-April 2016. Survivors asked for assistance in private meetings with the county and from elected officials when that failed. As the attack’s one-year anniversary neared, survivors sought help publicly at San Bernardino County board of supervisors’ meetings. The county accepted workers’ comp claims from 59 people, including 57 survivors who were at the Inland Regional Center during the attack and a probation department employee who later helped survivors at the IRC. RELATED: After two years, San Bernardino County selects consultant for memorial to honor victims of terrorist attack The county reports 2,484 of 2,763 treatment requests, or 90 percent, were approved, which includes 137 modified, usually to reduce treatment. Two hundred were denied, 94 denials were appealed and 22 denials were overturned.  The county also denied psychological injury claims from 24 employees, who weren’t there for the attack. Ly said her clients’ approvals were far less than 90 percent. The county initially denied then later accepted the claim from the probation department employee. Delays and denials were still happening in July, when survivors Julie Swann-Paez and Sally Cardinale testified about their struggle to the state Senate Labor and Industrial Relations Committee during a hearing on Reyes’ bill, AB44, and shared that one survivor waited nine months for a bone graft. Another waited 19 months for trauma counseling. Some denials continue. Physical therapy to desensitize scars on a young male survivor shot in the abdomen, flank and knee, plus referrals to an orthopedist to evaluate the knee, were recently denied, said the worker’s Ontario attorney, Christel Schoenfelder.  Legislators and survivors’ attorneys say county officials didn’t recognize the need to quickly get their workers treatment for trauma and other wounds that Reyes and Stone said were akin to battlefield injuries. Jackson, who sits with Stone on the state Senate Labor and Industrial Relations Committee overseeing industrial safety and workers’ comp, was astonished the county didn’t do everything in its power to help. “Why in the world would the county of San Bernardino resist caring for its workers, who are the victims of an attack by a co-worker?” Jackson said by phone recently. “I’m still dumbfounded that that would be the attitude taken by any employer, let alone a government employer.” After 14 people (13 county workers) were killed, 22 wounded and at least 57 left with post-traumatic stress, county officials were legally required to inform survivors this was now a workers’ comp case but didn’t — the first time the county denied or delayed treatment, Ly said. RELATED: ‘We will never forget’ San Bernardino terror attack victims, mourners say on second anniversary County spokesman David Wert said the county provided information about workers’ comp benefits by Dec. 7 and 8, 2015. Survivor Ray Britain, the county Environmental Health Services division’s interim chief on Dec. 2, said that’s not true. At a Dec. 10, 2015, meeting the FBI set up to help survivors, county Risk Management staff who were asked about services neglected to tell survivors or relatives of those who were then “walking zombies” that they were entitled to workers’ comp benefits, Ly said. Risk management told survivors who knew to ask for claim forms they didn’t appear to need them and didn’t need to fill them out then because the county would send information packets with forms later – but no packets ever came, Britain said. When survivors’ doctors submitted requests for treatment authorization — basically, medical recommendations — to county risk management for approval, claims adjuster Christina Hurtado sent the requests to outside utilization review doctors who denied, delayed or modified requests. County officials later said they were required to send all treatment requests to outside utilization review. That’s not true, according to the state industrial relations department and Reyes, the assemblywoman. She’s an attorney who’s handled workers’ comp cases for 35 years. Irvine attorney Keith More, a three-time Workers’ Compensation Trial Lawyer of the Year who represents a survivor, said the county used utilization review to deny survivors “well-deserved” medical treatment when it could have approved “every ounce of treatment.”  The California Supreme Court ruled employers and insurers can approve treatment under internal utilization review. They can even OK treatment denied by outside review, said Jason Marcus, president of Sacramento-based California Applicants’ Attorneys Association, a group of injured workers’ lawyers. Utilization review was set up as a process for an employer or insurer who wants to deny or modify a doctor’s treatment request. While employers and insurers can OK treatment, only another physician can deny or change the primary doctor’s recommendation, Marcus said. County officials said many problems came from survivors’ doctors not submitting the right paperwork. Schoenfelder agrees. But More and Ly said the county adjuster often didn’t send utilization review all medical reports needed to support treatment, which led to denials, delays or modifications. Utilization review doctors can ask for more records but usually just deny, Schoenfelder said. In December 2016, county supervisors expanded the use of outside case managers to expedite claims. Survivors’ attorneys say some helped and some didn’t. Britain disagrees with former county CEO Greg Devereaux’s May 2016 statement the terrorists “win” unless the county comes out “stronger economically” afterward. Britain said county officials had a misguided focus on economics and disregarded their injured employees’ well-being to save money. “I think the terrorists win when you lose track of humanity,” Britain said. Legislators and Marcus say Dec. 2 survivors were treated like any other employees hurt on the job – highlighting a larger problem that injured workers statewide are having in obtaining medical treatment. Insurers and employers concentrate on disproving the need for care, yet 95 percent of claims are legitimate, Jackson said. “The system we have sadly assumes the worker did not get injured on the job,” she said. “Therefore, the whole focus is on denying care and claims, rather than addressing them immediately and trying to get them treatment.” Utilization review and other changes were designed to reduce treatment, she added. Survivors’ attorneys say utilization review doctors deny or modify 65 to 95 percent of treatment requests, and denials are usually upheld by independent medical review, then kept in place for a year. Many employers never send workers for treatment, Ly said. RELATED: Survivors of Sept. 11, Oklahoma City terror attacks share their stories, recovery Treatment requests are often handled mechanically without determining what’s needed to cure workers or considering the judgment of treating doctors who actually see patients, said Marcus. Adjustors also send treatment requests to out-of-state outside review physicians with the wrong specialty for a particular injury — a practice the insurance industry has fought to continue, More said. “It’s the abuse of the utilization review process,” he added. Survivors believe this happened because the county doesn’t want to “deal with a lifetime of having to accommodate them,” Ly said. As of Nov. 30, 29 out of 57 survivors had returned to work for the county at some point. Twelve now work full-time and 10 with doctor-required work restrictions work part-time, while five are out on medical leaves and two left the county, said Wert. Britain said when someone returns full-time without restrictions, they may relapse and be put on leave after a few months. Wert wouldn’t give details on how long the county would accommodate restrictions or allow survivors to work part-time. But Ly said state law allows employers to fire employees after accommodating their restrictions for one year – even Dec. 2 terrorist attack survivors.  The system was set up to get injured workers back to work, not for profit. Yet a Workers’ Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau analysis shows SB863 saved insurance companies $1.3 billion from 2012 through 2016 – mostly from decreased medical treatment through independent medical review’s introduction, said Diane Worley, California Applicants’ Attorneys Association’s policy director. Reyes introduced AB44 to allow attack survivors’ workers’ comp claims to skip utilization review and extend their benefits from two years to four and a half. The bill was gutted by the Assembly Insurance Committee. On July 12, an amended AB44 requiring employers to immediately provide attack survivors with case managers and treatment options passed out of the Senate Labor and Industrial Relations Committee and later passed both houses and became law. Jackson and Stone, the committee vice chairman, are now fired up to look closely at workers’ comp. Costs largely arise from workers not getting treatment soon enough, said Jackson. “The supervisor doesn’t have any comment at this time,” said county Policy Advisor Don Holland. Employers and insurers should once again face stiff fines for delaying benefits, Marcus said. Another key reform would require all necessary medical records be sent to outside utilization review and for utilization review doctors to be qualified in the specialty they review, More said by phone. At the AB44 hearing, Stone, a former Riverside County supervisor who lost friend Damian Meins in the Dec. 2 massacre, vowed to make “retooling” the worker’s comp system a “high priority” in 2018 after hearing survivors’ testimony, including that survivors were treated like they were suspected of fraud and a utilization review nurse denied survivors’ medication when only a doctor can. In a recent interview, Stone committed to ensuring there are no gaps in service for injured workers, especially survivors of workplace violence, and said problems are likely happening in other counties, too. “We pay the highest rates in the country. The least we deserve is for employees to get the care they need,” he said. Trauma experts and lawyers say Dec. 2 survivors were further harmed by secondary trauma from their struggles to get help. Acknowledging that, Stone described the delays and denials as “completely inappropriate.” “I don’t want to see a recurrence of the debacle that we witnessed in San Bernardino happen again,” he said.

208,http://uproxx.com/news/what-was-stephen-paddock-motive-las-vegas-shooter/,"Following the senseless Las Vegas massacre — which killed at least 59 people and left another 525 injured — carried out by Stephen Paddock, authorities are left with the insurmountable task of making sense of it all. Initial details in the hours after the shooting touched upon Paddock’s background and home life. More information is now trickling forth and paints a confusing picture of what could have motivated the 64-year-old Paddock (one of the oldest mass shooters in modern history) to commit such an atrocity. In other words, these new details yield clues and prompt more questions than answers. A Vast Arsenal: Within Paddock’s hotel room and Mesquite retirement-community home, investigators discovered 42 firearms along with explosives and thousands of ammo rounds. Since Paddock didn’t have a criminal record, Nevada’s gun laws would allow him to amass such a collection, which included automatic rifles that may have been converted from semiautomatic weapons. His stash included “AR-15-style and AK-47-style rifles.” A Recent Retiree Who Gambled Big: According to brother Eric Paddock, Stephen — a recently retired accountant — spent much of his time in Vegas, where he regularly dropped tens of thousands of dollars in a day. Eric told reporters that “he was a gambler, that was his job,” and their family wasn’t concerned about how Stephen “lived in a hotel room” for months at a time. In the days leading up to the massacre, Paddock conducted a number of large transactions, although it’s not known whether these were wins or losses. Investigators noted, however, that Paddock could have lost a million dollars in Vegas, and it wouldn’t have impacted his lifestyle, which rules out a spur-of-the-moment crime of passion after losing big at a casino. A Quiet Multimillionaire Who Didn’t Flaunt His Wealth: Neighbors in Mesquite knew Paddock as a quiet man who referred to himself as a pro gambler. Although he was worth at least $2 million at the time of his death, Paddock’s unassuming presence — polos, khakis, and a simple car — didn’t attract attention, and he didn’t spend much time at home. That impression was aided by the fact that Paddock also owned properties in California, Florida, and Texas. In fact, the only detail of note for one Mesquite neighbor was that Paddock’s garage held an enormous safe, which may have been where he stored much of his arsenal. A “Normal, Average” Guy, According To A Gun Shop Owner: Chris Mitchel of Dixie GunWorx awoke to news of the mass shooting and felt completely gutted upon remembering that he had sold a shotgun (which was not used in the Vegas massacre, since Paddock’s targets were hundreds of yards from his Mandalay Bay window) to Paddock. Yet as Mitchel recalled, Paddock seemed like “a normal customer” — sort of a “Joe Blow” type of guy — who shopped with them a few times but never set off alarm bells. A Baffling Mystery Of Intent: While Paddock’s father sat atop the FBI’s Top 10 Most Wanted list for nearly a decade (in connection with bank robberies), Stephen never ran afoul of the law until Sunday night in Vegas. Eric Paddock still can’t wrap his head around why his brother — who publicly held no political or religious affiliation — would commit mass murder. “There’s absolutely no sense, no reason he did this,” said Eric. “He’s just a guy who played video poker and took cruises and ate burritos at Taco Bell.” Investigators will continue to dig into Stephen Paddock’s homes and affairs for some time to come, but all clues from Paddock’s hotel room indicate a meticulously planned act of mass murder. His long-time companion, Marilou Danney, was also out of the country this weekend, which may prevent her from providing additional insight into why her partner plotted such a horrific crime. So for now, the mystery deepens, but questions shall continue.

209,http://uproxx.com/life/gun-control-las-vegas-texas/,"On October 1, a gunman opened fire from a hotel room in Las Vegas — leaving 58 dead and 546 wounded. It was the worst mass shooting in American history, though you’d be forgiven for forgetting that. After all, the distance between mass shootings seems perfectly calibrated to fit our nation’s collective short-term memory: Day 1: “Thoughts and prayers.”
Days 2-7: “TOO SOON TO POLITICIZE!”
Days 8-14: “We have a lot to focus on as a nation; yes, this is an issue, but something something mental health and… Look over there! Is that a celebrity?!”
Days 15-34: “What shooting? Oh, that old thing? I can’t believe you even remember –”
Day 35: Rinse. Repeat. There were 35 days between Las Vegas and Sutherland, Texas. That seems particularly short, but not enough to shock me. Since I started at Uproxx on June 1, 2015, there have been eight mass shootings in the United States — including the #1 and #2 deadliest in history — so I’ve had plenty of chances to ponder the subject: Each of these pieces stimulated conversation about guns, their place in America, and the nation’s futile quest to have less violence while also refusing to enact meaningful legislative change. And in all of these conversations, I was taken to task over the terms with which I wrote about guns. Commenters chewed me to pieces over my wobbly usage of the phrases “semi-automatic weapon,” “high capacity clip,” and “assault rifle.” For what it’s worth, they were right. The layperson’s vision of a semi-automatic is a rapid-repeating rifle — something akin to an AR-15 — but most handguns today also fulfill the definition of semi-automatic, in that the user is not chambering cartridges manually. High capacity magazines are even more murky. AR (which stands for Armalite rifle, not “Assault Rifle”) magazines come standard at 30 rounds. So a “high capacity” AR magazine would be greater than 30 rounds, far exceeding the typical legislative definition of “high capacity magazines” in states where such laws have passed (which is usually set at 10 or 15 rounds). Even the term “assault rifle” is embedded with shades of gray. Though it seems like an easy catch-all term for non-gun types, the military definition of an assault rifle would actually exclude weapons like the AR-15 — since that gun doesn’t have a “selective fire” feature, which would allow it to be shot automatically or in burst mode. Even if you know guns, even if you’re cleared for CCW (carrying a concealed weapon) with a FFL (Federal Firearms License), you can see how the jargon of America’s most beloved toys can get disorienting. The terms are tricky and the scale for how they apply to different sized weapons is a sliding one — so it’s hard for lawmakers to create bills that don’t get quagmired in semantics. (Which explains why the NRA wisely pushes small laws that conspire together to achieve something bigger, rather than trying to enact sweeping change all at once.) The question then is this: Do you have to “get guns” to be a part of substantive conversations about weapons in this country? Can a confusion of terms or a jumbling of specs identify someone as not deserving a seat at the table when it comes time to talk gun control? Answer: Hell no. And yet, that’s the common retort, over and over. “Don’t know your Glock from your Desert Eagle? Go sit with the other hippies, while the adults talk.” The implication when you watch Tucker Carlson heckle a pro-gun reform writer  about his experience handling an AR-15 is simple: “People who don’t know about things from experience should not speak about them with any level of authority.” What a nice thought, especially from a man who talks about politics for a living without ever having held a public office. If only we could use Carlson’s idea as a gold standard for issues of abortion, the constitution, and religion. Alas, this is never going to happen. Because as Americans, there’s only one thing we value more than our beloved gun rights: Talking without having a complete handle on what in the world we’re talking about. Only a quarter of Americans know all three branches of government, but god knows that doesn’t stop us from holding (and sharing) strong convictions about them; our president has literally no idea where Puerto Rico is, but he’s still managing our disaster relief effort; and Idaho State Representative Vito Barbieri fights abortion tooth and nail without the ability to fathom that a woman’s digestive and reproductive tracts aren’t connected. Is it tragic that people with a knowledge gap still get to pop off on those issues of which they know little? That depends on how much power the uneducated parties have and how much knowledge is lacking. Discussing things is one of the ways that people learn about them. Debate, at its best, can be instructive. And inviting only experts to speak on issues that affect all of us is how those in power consolidate and horde it — remember that literacy tests were the ultimate voter suppression technique in the Jim Crow south. Besides, how much do you have to know about magazine sizes to declare with confidence that the website StackingBodies.com shouldn’t be allowed to sell a Surefire 100-round magazine via the internet? How versed in ballistics do you need to be to recognize that the AR-556 — used by Devin Patrick Kelley in Sutherland Springs — is a weapon for people who are trying to kill living things very efficiently in a non-sporting manner? Do you have to know the mechanics of trigger tension and bump stocks before you can feel confident stating that people should only own guns after applying for a license, passing a safety test, and filing for the legal title to their weapons (like we do with cars)?

At some point, asking people to parrot statistics to engage in the gun violence discussion is the ultimate straw man gambit: “Let’s pretend this conversation is about guns, and debate your authority to speak about them; rather than concede that this conversation is actually about human lives lost to guns.” When Tucker Carlson mocks gun-control activists because they don’t regularly handle the rifles they despise, he’s missing the point by light-years (while seeming absolutely assured of his moral high ground): You don’t have to know about something in order to not want to be killed by it. I know very little about how venom affects the body, but if someone wanted to let their pet cobra roam my yard, I feel like I could make a strong argument to the neighborhood association about why they shouldn’t be allowed to do so. Perhaps the metric for who should get to talk about certain subjects and what level of baseline knowledge is required should be linked to how much the topic in question affects us and the power being wielded by those doing the talking. Should I have had all my terms buttoned up before jumping into the gun-discussion on a platform this size? Probably. Should lawmakers be able to cite their facts about guns and talk about them with confidence on the Senate floor or to smug TV hosts? Yep. But do lay people need to understand the difference between a clip and a magazine in order to advocate, march, and call their representatives about gun control? That’s ridiculous. This is an issue that touches human lives, and humans have every right to respond to it. Sure, the conversation needs more active, involved, knowledgeable participants, but that knowledge might be about guns or it might be about utilitarian ethics (which often comes to bear on this topic). Besides, anyone who’s ever read up on the thousands of accidental shootings we have per year in this country knows that not even gun owners know much about their beloved weapons (like, for instance, how to make them inaccessible to toddlers). It’s been said that doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the very definition of insanity. Through this prism, it’d be hard to call our response to mass shootings anything less than insane. Our actions haven’t changed significantly in years and probably won’t this time around — but the suggestion that you have to know about guns in order to be repulsed by the destruction they wreak is yet another absurd roadblock thrown up by those interested in stalling the conversation. Will our nation change course after yet another mass shooting? Doubtful. But letting 2nd amendment loyalists twist the issue to make it about gun knowledge rather than a desire by gun safety advocates to have less people die pushes us into the theater of the bizarre and ought not be tolerated for a second. After all, it doesn’t take a working knowledge of hollow-tipped versus full metal jacket bullets to know that this Texas family didn’t deserve to have three generations decimated by them.",2017-12-04 16:00:43,You Don’t Have To Know About Guns To Fight For Stricter Gun Laws,,68816,http://www.uproxx.com/#spider
210,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/31/houston-police-find-small-arsenal-ammunition-in-downtown-hotel-room.html," Police in Houston discovered a small arsenal of firearms and ammunition in a downtown hotel room ahead of a large New Year's Eve party, according to reports. Russell Ziemba, age 49, was extremely depressed and intoxicated when he was arrested, NBC News reported, citing several senior law enforcement officials. NBC added that the man allegedly told officers that he loves the U.S., is an Army veteran, and did not intend to harm anyone. Early Sunday, officers discovered the weapons at the Hyatt Regency on Louisiana Street after they were called to confront a man who was apparently intoxicated and causing a disruption, according to local television news station KPRC-TV. They arrested the man for trespassing and public intoxication, the station added. When police attempted to gather the man's possessions at the hotel, they found  an AR-15 rifle, a shotgun and a handgun, along with many rounds of ammunition, according to the Houston Chronicle. The guns were not loaded, and Ziemba stored them in his room because he feared they would be stolen if he left them in his truck, officials said, according to NBC. He recently had a domestic relations problem and had to remove his belongings, including his guns, from a residence, NBC added. KPRC-TV said the man's room was located on the hotel's top floor. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo tweeted that the situation was contained. CHIEF TWEET A spokeswoman for the Hyatt Regency confirmed to CNBC that hotel plans to proceed with its New Year's Eve festivities, which include a massive balloon drop, a four-hour party and live musical acts. The Chronicle said about 2,000 people are expected to attend the event. ""The safety and security of our guests and colleagues is our top priority, and consistent with the hotel's prepared security plans, heightened measures are in place on New Year's Eve,"" the hotel's manager said in a statement, according to the Chronicle. The incident comes nearly three months after a gunman opened fire on a crowd from a Las Vegas hotel room, killing dozens and injuring more than 500. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Days ago, Las Vegas unveiled heightened security measures for New Year's Eve, including more than 350 personnel from the Nevada National Guard. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

In doing so, it’s hard not to get caught up in the many global struggles we’ve experienced this year. There’s no forgetting the hurricanes, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, fires, and landslides that have devastated communities. But rather than become mired in a depressive state, those events can be framed as moments of phenomenal human strength and a testament to the love and resiliency we all have the power to harness. When it comes to exceptional photojournalism, Getty Images leads the pack, and we were lucky enough to have them curate a gallery of images that remind us of humanity’s kindness in the face of disaster. We spoke with Pancho Bernasconi, the VP of News at Getty Images, about the pictures in the collection and their importance. He also gave us some behind the scenes info about the business of taking these images, the danger (both emotional and physical) that photographers face, and what it feel like as an editor to see them come across his desk. If you’re having a hard time moving past the difficulties we’ve all faced over the past 365 days, these images will help you focus on the good that exists in the world. That’s what we want to carry into next year. When you’re looking for an image that’s related to these disasters, or tragedies, these moments of strength, what are you looking for in the images? I think it’s a mix. There is not one thing in particular that I think we look for. You want to get a sense of maybe motion. You want to give a sense of context. You want an image that helps you, as the viewer, have a sense of empathy for what’s going on at that moment with those people. That’s what great photographers do, and we’re lucky to have so many of them work here at Getty. They help you have a sense of empathy and a sense of understanding and a sense of caring for what’s happening in those moments. that’s what we look for, each one a little bit different. I noticed that there was a lot of hugging in them. So, I can see the moments of empathy; that makes sense. It’s funny. As I was looking at these, it’s hard to pick one that’s my favorite, but I think one that I like the best is not a hugging picture. It’s one of Joe Raedle’s from the floods in Houston. Volunteers are helping this older lady who is wading through the water. There’s just something really poignant about that moment. That kind of speaks to me; it’s a very quiet moment, but you know exactly what’s going on. Photographically, one of the things you look for is a picture that’s got lots of layers. You are able to see the story build in one frame. I think that picture does it really well. You have a sense of caring. There’s a guy on the left hand side who’s got a hold of the woman’s hand, but he’s doing it very gently; he doesn’t have his hand grabbed around her wrist. There’s tenderness and caring in that moment, and I think that something special like that surely sticks out for me. It definitely tells a story. They all do. You’re talking about how they resonate with you emotionally. When I’m looking at them, it’s just 18 images, and for me, it’s an emotional undertaking. But, you’re looking at hundreds of these things. Is it difficult to be inundated with all of that? Really super and central question and the answer is “Yeah, absolutely.” We are normal humans that have emotions and are affected by what we see. There are certainly times when it is hard and challenging to look at things, but we’re also professionals in terms of making sure that the photographs are the ones that best tell the story, and they get to our customers quickly. But, again, I’m really happy that you asked that question, because it is something that we are super mindful of. For us, as editors here in the office, but also for our photographers, we’re mindful of having to cover too many of those things in a row. You put yourself out there emotionally. You have to be in the moment to be able to recognize it and photograph it. So, we pay attention and care to photographers and their wellbeing when they are covering those things as well. I’m glad to know that. It occurred to me so many things have happened recently that you’re having to deal with a new one of these events every week. And, perhaps, photographs are more immediately impactful than writing. Sometimes. I don’t want to take away from my writing brethren, but I think they impact on different levels. I think there is an immediacy to a photograph, especially one that is very poignant from a scene, that helps set the stage for what words will later say. But, I think photographs have that immediacy and that urgency and that connection that people crave now. Did you work as a photographer at any point? Very briefly. When I first started thirty some years ago as an intern on a wire service in Washington, D.C., I was a photographer and I freelanced, but I quickly became an editor and stayed that course through my career. But I think there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t put something on my Instagram account. Really? Yeah, here in New York, I see pictures all the time. You can’t ever turn that off, right? It’s always there. That’s awesome. I didn’t even think about that. Yeah, if your job is looking for images, you must see them everywhere. Yeah, you cannot turn that off. It’s always on.

KARIM SAHIB/AFP/Getty Images You talked about making sure your photographers are emotionally supported; are they in physical peril as well? I think it depends. Photographers are sometimes like firemen; they’re running towards things as opposed to running away from things. I don’t know that they are in peril, but we are very aware of their safety. They are very aware of their safety. We always try to send photographers that have situational awareness, as we call it. They’ve been in things like that before. You know, our staff photographers, like Joe Raedle, or Scott Olson, they’ve been doing this for a long time. They’re seasoned professionals. They’ve been in these situations before. They know what to look for, and they know how to handle themselves. There is no such thing as a 100% guarantee of people’s safety, and we know that very personally from the death of Chris Hondros in 2011 in Libya. But, yeah, sometimes our photographers are in peril. I think some of the pictures in this slideshow have a sense of that. Hurricanes are really dangerous for people. But, you let that storm pass and you go out and you do your job. You as a professional work with your editors and the people you know and trust to mitigate those as much as possible. And, we have to trust our photographers to know when to go into situations that are not 100% safe, but are safe enough, because we mitigated risks. And, when they have to not go. And, people take safety classes, hostile environment classes they’re called, to help them learn to look at things and be aware of things going on around them. That’s really interesting. Getty has these classes? There are several organizations that put hold classes that you can pay for. There are some classes that are kind of given as fellowships to younger photographers or freelancers. They are called situational awareness or hostile environment classes that help folks deal with all sorts of things. They could be very extreme or in between. Going to a conflict, they used to pretend kidnap you. They also teach you basic kinds of first aid for the battlefield, which is a very good thing. There’s an organization that’s called RISC that was started after Tim Hetherington was killed in Libya, along with Chris Hondros, and it teaches photographers how to apply basic medical attention to battlefield wounds. Basic first aid and a little bit more advanced first aid in situations where you have to apply a tourniquet or do other things. We have our photographers go through that every few years to get refreshed on it and to know how to do those things. Because, it’s not a skill you just have, you have to be taught, and have to repeat it and learn it. It’s one of those things that unless you are part of the field, it just wouldn’t have occurred to me, but now that you mention it, seems incredibly important. It is incredibly important, and it also gives us comfort and safety in terms of knowing that when we have to put people in situations where it’s not 100% safe, that we’ve done what we can to give them the tools to be able to handle situations that could come up. As a segue to another topic, why is capturing these images important? It’s important because it’s the way the world looks back at itself. It’s a photographer’s job, mission if you will, to document the world, so it can see itself. If nobody’s there to make these moments, to take these photographs, to record these emotions, these happenings, these moments of human kindness and moments of human charm, we don’t know how to learn some of these things. We don’t know how to react when there’s a hurricane going on, and people are asking for donations; you don’t have a sense of a scale. It’s through photographs. From our photographers and others that the rush to the fray, we understand the sense of the scale of Harvey, or the sense of the scale of the damage in Puerto Rico, or the level of destruction inflicted in places like Mosul. The value of photographs has never been more important. The value of an image has never been more important and crucial than it is today. It’s through the work of these photographers that’s allowed to happen. The world can have a conversation through a shared sense of an image or a truth, if you will. These are all spontaneous journalistic moments, which gives them more resonance, obviously, in depicting what’s going on in the world. It’s a true slice of time. It’s one 1/100th or 1/500th, of a second of a moment that the shutter clicks. But, it is a true moment that is happening. No doubt about it. These photographs of strength are obviously beautifully composed, is there a specific kind of composition to news photographs? Or, is it sort of universal to the visual medium? The best of them connect with you, the viewer, the reader. I don’t know that it matters that it’s a news photograph or an amazing photograph of Beyonce just singing her heart out or an amazing photograph from the Olympics of a ski jumper just at that moment when he just takes off on a 90 meter hill or it’s a portrait of a president or a dictator or a child along the border. I think the part that is the same is that you’re able to connect. Whether that’s a still photograph or a piece of art, or whatever the visual medium is, is the ability for it to connect with the user. I think that is the thread through all of it. Do you recall the moment some of these images came to you? Absolutely. These photographs come into our picture desks and our editing team sees them first. There are pictures coming in all the time, and our editors are looking through them, having conversations with the photographers, checking the metadata, making sure the captions are okay, making sure the dates are okay, and making sure that the who, what, where, when, and why of journalism is correct in the photographs. I remember the pictures. I wasn’t in the office for the David Becker photographs from Las Vegas after the shooting. Those are super impactful, and very moving. The photographs from the Houston flooding, we were here for a lot of that. Watching those photographs come in is an anticipatory moment. Your photographer says “I have some photographs, I’m going to start sending them to you,” and you’re watching a pot, wanting it to boil. The photographs come in and you see that moment that gets delivered, and it’s quite a feeling that just doesn’t go away. No matter how hard the moment is, there’s something magical about seeing this split second. Even if it’s a hard scene, there’s something special about seeing that moment stopped. Is it partially because you know the power it will have on your audience? I think so. It’s also just because you know you’ve put your best people in a place to do their best work, and when they do that, that’s a really great feeling. Right? We send our best photographers to the stories that matter most. When they send the photographs back and you see what amazing wonderful photograph they’ve composed, that brings you joy and you’re proud. I’m super happy and delighted to be able to send that out to our customers, to see that work be used. But, it’s the photographer’s vision that the world gets to see the next day. That’s a really powerful and big responsibility. I can see that. And, because the moment is so fleeting, that I suppose it is sort of nerve racking, waiting for the images to come, because there’s no way to replicate that. That’s right. It happened and then it didn’t, right? You’ve got to capture that moment that otherwise does not exist. It’s there and then it doesn’t ever happen again, right? That’s one of the beautiful, magical, powerful things about photography, it’s that split second. And then, only through photography, can that moment live on. So, if you miss it, it dies. Well, it lives in the hearts of the people that experienced it. It does. It absolutely does. There might be other moments, but not that one that you’ve captured. It is unique. It’s a pretty amazing career choice for people. It’s a special talent to be able to see that way. Absolutely, and on your part, it must be a privilege to know that you are part of this process of taking small moments and delivering them to the entire world. It is a responsibility and a privilege that I am thankful for every day. To work with the amazing people that I do, it’s the best part of the day. No doubt about it.

214,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-hope-we-do-this-much-cool-stuff-in-2018/,"By FiveThirtyEight Filed under 2017 in Review Published Dec. 29, 2017 As the FiveThirtyEight staff recovers from a hectic year of news, we’ve been reflecting on our favorite stories from the past 12 months. What follows is not a comprehensive list of our best work, but it is some of what has lingered in our minds as we get ready for 2018.1 Our editor in chief, Nate Silver, started the year like many others: trying to make sense of the 2016 presidential election. He wrote a dozen essays about what happened, including entries on President Trump’s superior Electoral College strategy, the media’s probability problem and “the Comey letter.” This summer, Kid Rock was rumored to be the next celebrity to follow Trump’s path into politics. But the poll that started the buzz came from a shady corner of the internet and may not have been conducted as advertised. Harry Enten went down a rabbit hole and found that fake polls are a real problem. When Trump was a candidate, he often noted that the electoral system was rigged because so many noncitizens were registered to vote. But the evidence that Trump cited when making claims of voter fraud didn’t show what Trump said it did. Maggie Koerth-Baker investigated how an academic paper became a keystone of the Trump administration’s allegations of voter fraud. After about half a year of the Trump presidency, Julia Azari came to a striking realization: Trump is a 19th-century president facing 21st-century problems. The media’s coverage of the Trump administration has been filled with stories that employ anonymous sources to discuss what’s happening in the White House. Not all anonymous sources are created equally, though. Perry Bacon Jr. put together a guide for when to trust a story that uses anonymous sources and which anonymous sources are worth paying attention to. As the Democrats seek to take back Congress in 2018, David Wasserman wrote about their uphill climb: The congressional map is historically biased toward the GOP. Trump’s rise to power inspired a huge following in some corners of the internet. In March, we profiled one of the president’s most rabid fan clubs: a subreddit called “The_Donald.” As the Supreme Court deliberates partisan gerrymandering, Galen Druke has been profiling the problems with redistricting reform efforts: Partisanship always finds a way back in. Trump’s contentious back and forth with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, was a defining story of the summer. As the heads of state traded threats, Oliver Roeder wrote about how game theory can be used to win a nuclear standoff.   As stories about sexual assault and harassment inundated the fall, Clare Malone noted that nearly all of them were about people in white-collar industries. That prompted her to investigate whether the #MeToo moment will reach women in low-wage jobs. Anna Maria Barry-Jester spent much of the year covering the Republicans’ efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act. But she also looked beyond Obamacare. In April, she wrote about how patterns of death in the South still show the outlines of slavery, and in June, she wrote that the health care system is leaving the southern Black Belt behind. In conjunction with those stories, Ella Koeze created an interactive map that shows 35 years of American death data. After the mass shooting in Las Vegas, there was some debate over whether stronger gun laws lead to less gun violence. But just looking at correlations between gun laws and violence isn’t enough, Jeff Asher and Mai Nguyen wrote, because guns can cross state lines even when gun laws don’t.  When the FBI released its first crime report under Trump, Clare Malone and Jeff Asher noticed something: It was missing a ton of data, and the agency’s explanations for why didn’t add up. FBI Director Christopher Wray now says the data will again be released to the public. This hurricane season was relentless for the U.S., with several major storms causing major damage. If Hurricane Sandy is any indication, the recovery from that damage is not going to be quick. Julia Wolfe and Oliver Roeder used FiveThirtyEight’s longest chart ever to show that New York City is still getting calls about Sandy recovery.  After the U.S. men’s national soccer team broke our hearts with the worst loss in the history of U.S. men’s soccer, we went looking for another squad to support. It’s not like us to just pick things at random, so we designed a quiz that helps you find the World Cup team you should root for.  Despite never playing a snap in the 2017 NFL season, Colin Kaepernick dominated the conversation around football this year. As Kaepernick went unsigned in the offseason, Kyle Wagner and Neil Paine investigated whether it was Kaepernick’s skills that were to blame. It wasn’t.  As the 2016-17 NBA season came to a close, FiveThirtyEight’s NBA team made the case for five different MVPs, including the eventual winner, Russell Westbrook.  One of the runner-ups for MVP, James Harden, has bloomed over the past few years into one of the league’s best players. Chris Herring noted one of Harden’s many quirks: He’s great at drawing fouls behind the 3-point line.  Nate Silver is tired of baseball closers being used only as ninth-inning specialists. So, to help get more of a team’s best relievers in the game earlier, he created a new stat: the goose egg, which tracks which relievers are the best at putting out fires when the stakes are highest.  People are still trying to figure out why there are so many dang home runs in baseball now. Rob Arthur continued his investigation into the home-run surge, and the evidence points to the balls being juiced.  Speaking of those home runs, midway through this MLB season, there had been 56,785 home runs hit since the start of 2006. Neil Paine and Rachael Dottle charted how far those home runs would have traveled if you put them all together (4,280 miles) and which MLB player’s bombs traveled the furthest.  For years, the Bechdel Test has been used to evaluate whether a film is invested in its female characters. But the Bechdel Test is an imperfect measure of Hollywood’s inequalities. So Walt Hickey, Ella Koeze, Rachael Dottle and Gus Wezerek canvassed Hollywood in search of a new one and watched 2016’s 50 top-grossing movies to see how they stacked up.  Is your Dungeons & Dragons character rare? Gus Wezerek went spelunking to tell you whether you’re basic in your selection of a goliath paladin. If you’re still searching for that perfect margarita recipe, Walt Hickey, Nate Silver, Christine Laskowski and Tony Chow have you covered.  If one of your 2018 resolutions is to get better at spelling bees, we have the perfect guide for you. (It’s harder than it looks.)  In February and March, FiveThirtyEight’s science team explored Mars. As part of that series, Christine Laskowski and Maggie Koerth-Baker noted why sex is one of space’s final frontiers.  When Maggie Koerth-Baker wasn’t writing about space sex, she was writing about panda sex. In November, she wrote about Pan Pan, the panda who was so good at sex that he helped save his species.  The Trump administration has reshaped the nation’s science agenda, and Republicans are often demanding that researchers provide “sound science” to substantiate their claims. Christie Aschwanden wrote about that term and why the easiest way to dismiss good science is to demand sound science.  Dan Engber went to rural Oregon to find the grandfather of alt-science. His name is Art Robinson, and his contrarian views about things like climate change have found their way into powerful circles in Washington. Which will surely be less hectic … right??

215,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/513635990/0/phoenix/opinions~Your-Turn-Concealedcarry-bill-would-make-us-all-less-safe/,"It has been almost three months since the largest mass shooting in modern American history in Las Vegas, where one man shot and killed 58 people and left 546 people injured. Just 35 days later, a man walked into a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where he shot and killed 25 people, including a pregnant woman, and injured 20 more. The deep sorrow the victims' families feel knowing they will never see their loved one again is something that we know all too well. We have felt it every single day since our son, Alex, was shot and killed in the 2012 Aurora, Colo., movie theater mass shooting. The night Alex was murdered, he and his girlfriend were attending a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises.” When the shooter began spraying bullets into the dark theater, Alex got to the floor but his girlfriend, Amanda, froze. Alex jumped back up and pulled her to safety, but as he did a bullet hit his forehead. It was no surprise to us or anyone who knew Alex that he reacted heroically to save Amanda. There hasn't been a moment since Alex's death in which we aren't doubled over in pain, but we choose to move forward and dedicate our actions in his honor. That's why we joined the Everytown Survivor Network and have shared our story with members of Congress, urging them to take action to improve the federal background check system and help prevent convicted felons and domestic abusers from accessing firearms. ALLHANDS: Concealed-carry bill will fail (so stop freaking out) Since Alex's death, there have been too many horrific, national attention-grabbing mass shootings to count. Congress' inaction has been frustrating, but its recent action to make it easier for criminals to carry guns across state lines is infuriating. This month, House Republican leadership pushed the gun lobby’s top-priority legislation, “concealed carry reciprocity,” through the House of Representatives. Currently, every state sets its own standards for who can carry a concealed gun in public. ""Concealed carry reciprocity"" would not create a national standard for who can carry a hidden, loaded gun in public. Instead, it would force each state to accept the concealed carry standards of every other state, even states that have weaker standards, or worse, no standards at all. That means every state would have to allow people who have never passed a background check or had gun safety training to carry hidden, loaded guns in public. Arizona has experienced firsthand the devastating effects of weakening concealed carry standards. In 2010, Arizona legislators repealed the state's concealed carry permit requirement — and aggravated assaults committed with a firearm increased by 44 percent in the subsequent six years. “Concealed carry reciprocity"" would force each state to accept this dangerous ""permitless carry"" standard, even though 81 percent of Americans oppose allowing people to carry concealed guns without a permit, including top Arizona law enforcement officials. It is in Alex's honor that we thank our Arizona congressional representatives who voted no on ""concealed carry reciprocity."" We ask that Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake also vote no on “concealed carry reciprocity.” They must stand with the safety of Arizonans over the dangerous wishes of the gun lobby. Caren and Tom Teves, whose son was killed in the 2012 Aurora movie theater mass shooting, are members of the Everytown Survivor Network.

216,http://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/13/political-theater-on-guns-not-the-answer/,"Trending: One of the worst tendencies of politicians in the aftermath of a tragedy is the hijacking of public sentiment to promote sweeping proposals to expand government power. A recent case in point is a proposed ban on “assault weapons” after the tragic shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas. California’s Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced the legislation along with 22 other Democratic senators “for one reason: so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote.” One could say that the legislation is more political theater than it is a law that could have prevented the shooting in the Texas Setting aside the fact that “military-style assault weapon” is a mostly meaningless category that has more to do with aesthetics than anything else, the practical value of the proposal is questionable at best. Since the bill merely proposes banning the future sale and manufacture of 205 different weapons while allowing anyone who currently owns such weapons to keep them, the bill wouldn’t even fulfill Feinstein’s objective of “removing these weapons of war from our streets.” At best, such a proposal would make it more difficult for would-be mass murderers from acquiring certain types of firearms, but to the detriment of law-abiding citizens. In her statement announcing the introduction of the bill, Feinstein closes by lamenting the general inaction of the Congress after mass shootings. “After each shooting, we’re told it’s not the right time to act,” she said. “We’re told to respect the victims by sitting on our hands.” While we share the sense of the horror felt by Feinstein after every mass shooting, rushing to do something for the sake of doing something isn’t responsible. In the case of the Sutherland Springs shooting, we know that laws intended to keep weapons out of the hands of convicted felons and domestic abusers failed to do so because the Air Force failed to report the shooter’s criminal history to civilian authorities. Inspector general reports going back to 1996 have documented the failure of the military to fully report such convictions to the FBI. Get the latest news delivered daily!

218,http://uproxx.com/news/las-vegas-shooter-home-explosives-ammo/,"Following the Las Vegas mass shooting that left 59 people dead and over 525 injured, countless details began to pour forth on Stephen Paddock. The 64-year-old gunman, a white male who carried out the attack alone, reportedly used the credit card of his “companion,” Marilou Danley, to book his 32nd-floor hotel room at Mandalay Bay Resort. And at Paddock’s home — situated within a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada — authorities uncovered a sobering amount of weaponry to add to what he toted to Vegas. When Paddock was located by authorities (after one confusing timeline), police found over 23 firearms, including some that were fully automatic, according to the Wall Street Journal. Police reported that the room contained “AR-15-style and AK-47-style rifles” and a wealth of ammunition. In Paddock’s home and car, investigators found more guns and some explosives: Investigators searching Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nev., retrieved 19 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition, Las Vegas police officials said Monday. The sheriff said they also found Tannerite, an explosive that detonates when shot by bullets and is used in target practice. In Paddock’s car, authorities found more ammunition and ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used to make explosive, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. CNN confirms the number of total firearms (42) within Paddock’s known arsenal. In addition, investigators are digging into whether the automatic rifles used in the massacre were “converted from semiautomatic guns or purchased that way.” Beyond that, it’s difficult to imagine how someone acquired so many firearms without setting off alarm bells, but Paddock didn’t have a criminal record to deter his pursuit. While his hunting license in Alaska still wouldn’t explain the cache, Nevada’s gun laws don’t make it difficult to build a collection.

Ad Choices Sheryl Crow has shared an original wistful, heartfelt song focusing on hope for tomorrow. Proceeds from “The Dreaming Kind” will benefit Sandy Hook Promise’s lifesaving educational programs. Crow’s superb performance punctuates a message of tragedy and transformation. The song speaks to the pain our country has endured as tragedies are “getting hard to watch,” yet represents the voice of the families who founded and lead Sandy Hook Promise as well as supporters nationwide by saying: “I’m giving it all I got; there’ll be no more wasting precious time; giving it all I got; and nothing’s ever going to change my mind.” “The Dreaming Kind” is available as a name-your-price download on SherylCrow.bandcamp.com with a minimum contribution of 99 cents, with download proceeds going to Sandy Hook Promise. Contributions greater than 99 cents are of course accepted and appreciated. The video for “The Dreaming Kind” was filmed on location in Nashville and directed by Gus Black. The elegant and understated black and white film features Crow and her niece. The elegiac-yet-hopeful message reminds the viewer to “Never Forget – December 14, 2012.” Watch the video: “The tragedy in Newtown 5 years ago and the countless lives lost in mass shootings since have weighed heavily on my heart. I felt compelled to write “The Dreaming Kind” for the incredible people at Sandy Hook Promise who work so hard every day to combat gun violence. The extraordinary work this organization does to educate and protect our nation from further bloodshed gives me hope for a better tomorrow. I hope this song will inspire the same feeling in those who hear it,” said Sheryl Crow. “We are grateful to Sheryl for her extraordinary generosity. Every time I listen to the song, it immediately brings me to tears. Not only does it perfectly capture the emotion of our loss and everyday losses in our country, but I believe it epitomizes everything we do at Sandy Hook Promise to move forward and create real change. We know it will resonate with people everywhere and drive people to learn more about Sandy Hook Promise’s gun violence prevention programs and the positive impact they are having,” said Nicole Hockley, managing director and co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, and mother of Dylan, who was 6 years old when he was killed in the Sandy Hook tragedy. “The funding from the song’s downloads will help us accelerate training, which we deliver at no cost, to millions of youth and adults nationwide.” In addition “Tomorrow’s News,” a new PSA created with BBDO New York, follows the success of last year’s video “Evan,” which has received over 150 million views and helped reframe the conversation on gun violence prevention. The “Tomorrow’s News” PSA builds on signs exhibited by individuals who may hurt themselves or others that are often missed or not acted upon. The film shows a newscast covering a school shooting the day before it actually takes place. We can learn to “Know the Signs” and take action today to prevent gun violence tomorrow. BBDO, who received over 60 esteemed awards for “Evan” – including one of the top ads of 2016, donated all services and creative teams to make “Tomorrow’s News” for SHP. View the PSA here: “It’s easy to know the right thing to do after it’s too late to do anything. In this PSA, we illustrate that when it comes to gun violence prevention, the stakes are too high to let that continue to be the case. We hope this moves people to support Sandy Hook Promise in expanding its Know the Signs programs,” said Greg Hahn, chief creative officer of BBDO New York. “Tomorrow’s News” continues the conversation about the importance of knowing the signs of someone at risk and taking action. In this video, viewers’ perspective of a mass shooting will be upended as they see how easy it is to miss the signs or grapple with what to do when the signs are there,” said Mark Barden, managing director and co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, and father of Daniel, who was 7 years old when killed in the Sandy Hook tragedy.  “The work of Sandy Hook Promise focuses on preventing gun violence before it starts. ‘Tomorrow’s News’ is a powerful reminder that everyone can prevent a tragedy when they know the signs.” On Thursday, December 14, Sandy Hook Promise also invites everyone to participate in a “moment of silence” via Facebook Live to commemorate the five-year remembrance and those lost in the Sandy Hook shooting. In three years, SHP has trained over 2.5 million youth and adults across all 50 states with its evidence-based, no cost Know The Signs violence prevention programs. The programs focus on how to recognize the signs of at-risk behaviors and take action to intervene BEFORE individuals turn violent and hurt themselves or others. SHP’s four Know The Signs violence prevention programs—which include Start With Hello, Say Something, Signs of Suicide and Safety Assessment & Intervention—are offered free to schools and youth organizations across the country.  SHP’s programs have helped stop multiple school shootings, suicides and other acts of violence, as well as reduced incidences of bullying and helped many young people get the mental health services they need.

220,https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-the-charleston-loophole-the-us-tried-taking-guns-from-over-4000-people-who-werent-supposed-to-have-them-6776177,"News  One of the strongest gun control measures in the United States is the FBIâs National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. Though the process seems relatively simple â federally licensed gun dealers run a potential gun buyer's name through the FBI's database before selling them a firearm â it isn't foolproof. A problem becoming known as the ""Charleston loophole"" is putting guns in the hands of Americans who aren't allowed to have them. In fact, it's the very same loophole that allowed a white supremacist to buy a gun in 2015, which he later used to murder nine churchgoers in Charleston. ""There are so many things in federal gun law that are absurd, and this is definitely one at the top of the list,"" Laura Cutilletta, an attorney at the Giffords Law Center To Prevent Gun Violence, tells Bustle of the ""Charleston loophole."" NICS was established in 1993 under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, and it's meant to identify people who are legally prohibited from purchasing guns. This includes convicted felons, people who've been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, undocumented immigrants, people with domestic violence convictions, and more. When a name is fed into NICS, the FBI conducts a background check and reports back to the gun dealer on whether or not the sale is legal. Here's the loophole: If a gun dealer doesn't hear back from the FBI within three days of requesting a background check, they're allowed to sell the gun to the buyer anyway. Unlike some loopholes, this isn't some accidental consequence of carelessly written legislation; rather, it's explicitly detailed both in federal law and on the FBI's website. Gun sales like this, which are made even though the buyer hasn't passed a background check, are known as ""default proceeds."" Usually, this doesn't happen. FBI data says that in 2015, over 90 percent of background checks produced an immediate response. Only around 3.02 percent of background checks that year resulted in default proceeds, which sounds like a relatively small number â but on an absolute scale, it means that 371,000 Americans were allowed to buy guns that year without having passed a background check. More to the point, 2,892 of those gun buyers were later found to have been legally prohibited from owning guns. It's unclear what these people did that should have disqualified them from buying guns, as the FBI doesn't release such detailed data. In total, though, 43 percent of people who failed background checks in 2015 â and that includes folks who were successfully blocked from buying a gun â failed because they'd been ""convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year or a misdemeanor punishable by more than two years."" Another 19 percent couldn't pass a background check because they were a ""fugitive from justice,"" while about 10 percent had either a conviction or restraining order stemming from a domestic violence accusation. More details on this are available in the FBI's 2015 report on gun sales. When someone falls through the cracks in this manner and buys a gun they're not allowed to own, the FBI orders the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to retrieve the weapon. USA Today reported on Monday that in 2016, the FBI issued over 4,000 orders to seize weapons from buyers who fell through the Charleston loophole that year. That's the most seizure orders the agency has issued in a decade, according to FBI data. In 2015, someone who failed a background check but was allowed to buy a gun went on to commit a mass shooting. The white supremacist convicted of carrying out the 2015 Charleston church massacre had previously been convicted of possessing a controlled substance, which legally prohibited him from buying a gun. When he tried to buy a handgun, his name was fed into the NICS; thanks to a bureaucratic mix-up, however, the system didn't detect his conviction within the three-day window. ""The investigator had called the wrong county to look into this person's background,"" Cutilletta explains to Bustle. ""They never got a response, and meanwhile, the three days elapsed, and the gun was [sold] by default."" The buyer then used that gun to murder nine people. He later said said that he did this in hopes of igniting a race war, and has since been sentenced to death. In 2017, Democrats in the House and Senate introduced legislation to close the Charleston loophole. However, Republicans control both chambers, and GOP leadership hasn't put either bill up for a vote. In general, Congress has been incredibly reluctant to pass any form of gun control, largely due to opposition from Republican officials. Luckily for gun control advocates, though, state lawmakers also have a say in how background checks are conducted. As of 2015, at least 15 states plus Washington D.C. have enacted legislation that gives law enforcement more time to conduct background checks before gun dealers are allowed to proceed with a sale, according to Everytown Research. Delaware enacted a similar law the next year. ""It's easier to get things done at the state level, and unfortunately, that's what's had to happen,"" Cutilletta tells Bustle. As long as Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress, it's unlikely that background check laws will be strengthened any time soon on the federal level. But there's much more room for progress at the state level, which means your advocacy can make a difference. If you want to close the loophole and promote a stricter background check process, vote pro-reform canidates into state office at every possible election. And though closing the Charleston loophole seems like a small feat in the larger scheme things, it could stop thousands of people who shouldn't have guns from getting their hands on them in the first place.

221,http://www.ibtimes.com/mass-shooting-drawing-scene-florida-students-homework-lands-man-jail-2623305,"A man from Florida was arrested Friday because he reportedly drew a disturbing and threatening picture on an elementary school student’s homework. The drawing showed a schoolhouse on fire as a man shoots with his gun. The 33-year-old, Robert Paul Alexander Edwards of Mexico Beach, Florida, allegedly drew the horrifying scene in the student's notebook. Edwards in his drawing also illustrated two people shot on the ground lying in a pool of blood. The words, ""Pew, Pew, Pew,"" were written next to the person with the gun who was shown shooting at people standing in a queue. There was another person depicted in the picture who was on fire next to the words ""AHHH! It burns!"" Sheriff Mike Harrison, from Gulf County Sheriff’s Office announced the arrest of Edwards who has been charged with violating Florida State Statute 836.10 — written threat to kill or do bodily injury. According to the press release by Sheriff Harrison, the investigation sparked after a staff at the Port St. Joe Elementary School saw the illustration and contacted the School Resource Deputy about the alarming picture drawn on a student’s homework assignment. It is said that the drawing clearly showed a school building on fire, a person running from the school on fire, and several others who are shown standing in a queue were being shot by a gunman.  Sheriff Harrison said: ""Our country has been affected one too many times with horrific school tragedies. We take matters like this very seriously."" The case has been investigated jointly by the Sheriff and officials with Gulf District Schools. Investigators thoroughly interviewed Edwards. According to the release the department also explained that although the actions illustrated in the drawing were taken seriously, there was no indication that he would carry out the threat as depicted. Robert Paul Alexander Edwards of Mexico Beach, Florida, was arrested and charged with violating Florida State Statute 836.10 - Written threat to kill or do bodily injury — as he drew a disturbing image on an elementary school student’s homework. However, it is not known if Edwards had any connection with the student or how he got the student’s homework assignment notebook. In another incident in 2012, a teenage student was student arrested as his drawing demonstrated concerning behavior. A 16-year-old boy from Cedar Creek High School in Galloway Township, New Jersey, made illustrations in his notebook that appeared to be weapons. After a teacher noticed the drawing in the student’s notebook, the school authority contacted the police. The student was taken to the Galloway Township Police Department. Later, during the investigation, police searched the boy’s home on the 300 block of East Spencer Lane where they found several electronic parts and chemicals which if mixed together, could cause an explosion. The teenager whose name was not disclosed was charged with possession of a weapon and an explosive device. He was placed in Haborfields Juvenile Detention Center. According to a report in CBS Philly, speaking about the incident, the Superintendent of the Greater Egg Harbor Regional High School District, Steven Ciccariello said, ""This is a perfect example of a teacher implementing her training. She saw drawings that appeared disturbing to her and alerted school officials.""",2017-12-04 05:18:17,Mass Shooting Drawing Scene On Florida Student's Homework Lands Man In Jail,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

LAS VEGAS – Two Las Vegas security guards were fatally shot Saturday while investigating a disturbance in a room at a hotel-casino and the suspected shooter is facing critical injuries after turning the gun on himself, police said. The gunman's motive wasn't known but investigators believe it was an isolated incident. ""I want you to know right now that this has nothing to do with terrorism,"" Capt. Robert Plummer told reporters outside the scene of the shooting. The shooting happened before 7 a.m. at Arizona Charlie's Decatur, which is located west of the Las Vegas Strip. According to police, the suspect, Christopher Olague, ran from the hotel-casino after the shooting and into a nearby neighborhood where he tried to enter two homes but the residents were able to keep him out. Police found him in a laundry room accessible through a garage of the second home after he appeared to have shot himself in the head, Lt. Dan McGrath said. According to McGrath, Olague tried to enter the first home with the intention of stealing a car and also tried to take a vehicle on the street. Police described Olague's condition as a ""non-survivable wound."" The victims' identities were not released. Police said the uniformed security guards were a man and a woman in their 40s and that one was armed. Their identities and their causes of death will be released by Clark County Coroner's Office. McGrath said the circumstances of what happened in the hotel room still unclear. The hotel-casino's office did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The shooting comes a day before law enforcement officers expect tens of thousands of New Year's Eve revelers on the Strip and three months after the city dealt with the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Officials have been trying to reassure residents and visitors that the city is safe, especially in the wake of the Oct. 1 shooting. A high-stakes gambler killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below. He then killed himself.

223,http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/nra-pro-gun-lawmaker-exchange-fire-new-bill,"Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie butted heads with the National Rifle Association Thursday over a new bill in Congress that addresses deficiencies in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the database of people who are not allowed to buy firearms in America. The NRA, which has given more than $4,500 to Massie’s campaigns, said on its website the congressman was spreading misinformation about the bipartisan bill. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas has sponsored the legislation alongside Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York. The bill creates financial incentives for law enforcement to prevent guns from being sold to people with disqualifying criminal or mental histories. It also re re-emphasizes the need for federal and state agencies to upload these histories to the NICS so that Federal Firearms Licensees can check instantly whether a prospective buyer is qualified to purchase a gun. Congress renewed interest in strengthening NICS and its feeder requirements after it was discovered that the gunman in the mass shooting at a church in Southerland Springs, Texas, obtained guns after a 2014 domestic violence conviction because the Air Force did not properly report  the case. The conviction should have barred him from gun ownership. Massie, a staunch pro-gun advocate, said in a Dec. 2 Facebook post that the legislation is an extension of former President Barack Obama’s anti-gun agenda because it “[pressures] every branch of the administration (such as the Veteran’s Administration) to submit thousands of more names to the NICS background check database to deny gun purchases.” The NRA said on its website that Massie’s post contains misleading information. Watch: 10 Years of Congressional Efforts on Gun Control The bill does not expand disqualifications for gun ownership, the powerful gun lobbying group said. Rather, it simply requires that federal agencies submit the names of criminal offenders or people with mental health circumstances that disqualify them from owning a firearm. “This differs from former President Obama’s efforts, in which he attempted to administratively create new categories of individuals who were prohibited from possessing a firearm,” the NRA web page says. Massie is the only member of Congress the NRA has called out for withholding support from the bill. “It’s an odd day in Washington, D.C., when the NRA supports legislation backed by Sens. (Diane) Feinstein and Schumer,” Massie told the Louisville Courier-Journal.",2017-12-08 10:37:40,"NRA, Pro-Gun Lawmaker Exchange Fire Over New Bill",,19854,http://www.rollcall.com
224,https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/12/29/10-stories-2017-shouldnt-forget,"By Jacquielynn Floyd 8:00 AM on Dec 29, 2017 CST We're fixing to close out an eventful and contentious year: So much so, in fact, that it's been hard to keep up. Well, that's life in these times. Between whiplash news cycles and social-media explosions from the internet's volcanic abyss, even the biggest events in our shared consciousness don't keep center stage for long. We don't have to wait for the next bomb to drop. It probably already dropped, while you were on vacation, or sleeping late, or hunting for your car keys. What your grandpa called a ""nine days' wonder"" now gets maybe nine hours. Maybe less. Technology enabled this rapid-fire dissemination of information, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. At moments of crisis and emergency, news reaches us far more quickly than it did, even a few years ago. Social media allow all Americans to experience, and even to participate in the most significant events of our time. But there's just not enough bandwidth in our brains to take it all in. Keeping pace with current events is like standing under a waterfall and trying not to miss a drop, let alone keeping an eye on all the water already flowing downstream and out to a bottomless ocean of yesterday's news. The term ""information overload"" has been around since the '60s, but anybody with a cellphone can now live it in real time. In some cases, we have already forgotten news events with impact on our lives that still isn't clear. So I went through the annals of ancient history — back to last January, that is — and dug out a few forgotten nuggets, events that burned as hot as the sun in 2017 before quickly fading to cold and lifeless oblivion. Most of them are now ""Oh, yeah — I remember"" artifacts after only a few months. It's by no means a comprehensive list, but let's visit some old times together: 1. The Women's March. Millions of marchers, energy and enthusiasm, those memorable hats. What did it change? I'm not quite sure. The marchers embodied a widespread phenomenon: We have a lot of anger, and we're trying to find something to do with it. 2. Airport Protests. Americans rushed to local airports — including D/FW — to protest the new administration's Muslim-restricting travel ban, which is still being litigated. Among the protesters were more than 100 local lawyers who offered their services to detained travelers for free. 3. That Thing That Went Wrong at the Oscars. Moonlight? La-La Land? Does anybody remember which was which? Next year, maybe they'd better just give everybody a trophy. 4. Doctor Dragged Off United Airlines Flight. The forcible deplaning of a ticket-holding traveler by beefy airport security officers in Chicago sparked a brief revolt over passenger rights by downtrodden air warriors everywhere. 5. Bill O'Reilly Fired. It took the ""me too"" movement a while to spread, but then, it involved an awful lot of people. O'Reilly's dismissal from Fox News was among 2017s earliest inklings that even powerful people who generate a ton o' cash for their employers and investors might not be able to get away with serial sexual harassment anymore. 6. Steve Scalise Shot. A sitting member of Congress was gravely injured by a madman with a gun during a congressional baseball practice. It was a sobering shock, until fresher news intervened. The Louisiana Republican is still recovering. 7. Sean Spicer Quit. He was only one among many White House personnel who came and went with dizzying speed, but we were sort of used to him, thanks to Melissa McCarthy. 8. Solar Eclipse. It was a big deal. Still got those sun-gazing glasses you forked out over $50 for? 9. Night of the Living Tweet. The president's most outrageous statements tended to emerge via Twitter during the wee hours. Too numerous for recall, but greatest hits included ""Obama Had My Wires Tapped""; ""Puerto Ricans Want Everything Done for Them"" (after being left without shelter, power, medicine and transportation due to a hurricane); reporters are ""Enemies of the American People""; ""Bleeding Badly from a Face-Lift""; and the haunting, mysterious ""Covfefe."" 10. Mass Murder. Even the shortest and faultiest memory cannot have forgotten the horrifying mass shootings of innocent Americans in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs this year. But, be honest: Can you specifically recall another mass shooting incident during 2017? Under the general definition of any shooting in which four or more people were killed or injured, not including the shooter, it happened a great deal this year — more than 300 times. There was more, of course — much more: natural disasters, legislative battles, the terrible events in Charlottesville, celebrity dramas, deaths of prominent Americans. If you can't cite them all, don't feel bad about it. Nobody can. While you're making 2018 resolutions, though, here's one you might add: Take care of your brain. It's going to have to process more than ever next year. Jacquielynn Floyd. Jacquielynn Floyd is a metro columnist and editorial writer for the Dallas Morning News.

Tobias Rieder scored 54 seconds into the game and Antti Raanta stopped 25 shots for the Coyotes, who won for only the second time in 10 games. Lawson Crouse added his first goal of the season with 4:25 remaining. Arizona fell to Colorado 6-2 on Saturday prior to the NHL’s three-day break. Goligoski put the Coyotes ahead for good 10:34 into the second with his fourth goal of the season. Off a Colorado turnover, Clayton Keller pushed up the ice and fed Goligoski, who beat Colorado goalie Semyon Varlamov from the circle. Arizona won despite going 0 for 4 on the power play and failing to score on a 5-on-3 chance that lasted 1:53. Colorado’s penalty kill has not allowed a goal in its last 28 chances. Varlamov stopped 24 shots as the Avalanche failed to record at least a point for just the third time in nine games. Mikko Rantanen added his 11th goal of the season. Colorado was outshot 20-13 through two periods but came out firing in the third. Matt Nieto hit the crossbar 2:05 into the period and Nathan MacKinnon was denied on a breakaway chance at the 5:10 mark. Nikita Zadorov hit the crossbar with 7:05 remaining. The Avalanche fell to 10-7-1 at home this season. Earlier, Rieder scored his sixth goal of the season to put Arizona up 1-0 in the first minute. Varlamov lost track of the puck behind the net as Brendan Perlini sent a pass in front to Rieder, who scored glove-side with Varlamov facing the opposite direction. Colorado tied things at 1-1 3:56 into the first on Rantanen’s one-timer.

228,https://www.bustle.com/p/11-sandy-hook-gun-control-organizations-causes-you-can-support-on-the-5-year-anniversary-7589789,"News  Five years ago, in the early morning hours of Dec. 14, 2012, a gunman shot and killed 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Since then, little has been done on the federal level to prevent this kind of massacre from happening in the future, and just over a month ago, another mass shooter killed 59 people in Las Vegas. While it's easy to feel helpless in the wake of these kinds of tragedies, there are ways you can take action on the 5-year Sandy Hook anniversary. One way to address gun violence is by donating to a gun reform group like the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence or Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. You can also contribute to States United to Prevent Gun Violence, an umbrella organization that represents state-specific groups that combat gun violence. While there hasn't been much progress at the federal level, there have been 210 laws enacted at the state level to strengthen gun safety since Sandy Hook, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Other gun reform groups include the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Americans for Responsible Solutions. There are ways to support victims of gun violence as well, by volunteering at one of many violence support groups across the country. Donating time and money to the Gun Violence Survivors Foundation is another option. The organization doesn't participate in the gun control legislation debate, but does work to provide resources and services ""addressing specific needs facing a survivor of gun violence in America,"" according to the group's site. Christopher Hayes founded the organization after the Sandy Hook massacre rehashed vivid memories of his friend Bryan, who he'd lost to gun violence while in college. ""As news of the events at Sandy Hook unfolded, I considered the uncertainty and the fragility of our lives,"" Hayes wrote in a statement. There are also particular gun laws that experts say are more likely to reduce mass shooting deaths, for instance a three-day waiting period and an assault weapons ban. It's important to know which politicians have been vocally pro-strict gun regulation, and which ones are taking money from the National Rifle Association and are more likely to vote against even common-sense gun laws. You can also support the 14 volunteers trained by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America who are running for office in 2018. Another great organization to support is the Sandy Hook Promise. The group is comprised of parents who lost children in the massacre five years ago. They provide free training to schools and youth programs in order to educate students about recognizing early signs of violence. ""No one should ever lose a child in these kinds of circumstances, especially when it's preventable,"" Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son in the shooting, told PBS. ""We want to prevent other tragedies from happening by teaching people to know the signs of violence."" There are also groups dedicated to providing mental health resources to youth, like the National Organization for Youth Safety and the National Resource Center for Mental Health Promotion & Youth Violence Prevention. By volunteering with these organizations, you can help provide resources and technical assistance to states and local communities that foster well-being and prevent youth violence. In addition, via the site Mentor, you can access a national database of youth mentoring programs where you can work with children in your community. And beyond just donating your time and money, you can also check in with your loved ones regularly and speak up if you notice someone exhibiting potential signs of violence. If you're a gun owner, you can make sure you follow firearm safety tips to ensure someone who isn't supposed to access the gun isn't able to. Leading up to a mass shooting, there are signs everywhere, which the Sandy Hook Promise made clear with their latest PSA, ""Tomorrow's News,"" about the next inevitable mass shooting. And it's on all of us to be aware of them and to not give up on this fight, even when it seems hopeless.

229,http://www.nj.com/camden/index.ssf/2017/12/church_puts_faith_in_god_cops_during_active_shoote.html,"Bethel Church in Gloucester Township recently held a meeting on what to do if a gunman attacks the church.(Google Street View) Pastor Kurt Kinney of Bethel Church in Gloucester Township. Pastor Kurt Kinney freely admitted there was a time when his congregation would fully put their faith in God to protect them, especially in the sanctuary of their church. That time has passed. ""We just think it's very critical in this hour to partner with the police and really with anyone who can help us as a faith community to become more aware of the threats that are out there and minimize the risk,"" said Kinney, pastor of Bethel Church, a congregation of about 800 members in Gloucester Township, Camden County. ""Even though we believe that ultimately deliverance comes from God, we should not be naive that God would use the authorities he has called to bring that deliverance through."" Kinney put his words into action this week when his church hosted a workshop on what to do if an active shooter invades the church. The training came less than a month after a gunman in Texas fatally shot 26 people during a Sunday morning service at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland on Nov. 5, and more than two years after a church shooting in South Carolina claimed eight lives. Details of both shootings were incorporated in a slideshow and lecture presentation in front of several hundred people who attended the event Monday evening. ""The devil has a plan, also,"" said Lisa James, 53, a local resident who said her church pastor encouraged her congregation to attend. ""We didn't have to worry about this 10 years ago. Some people may not think about it, but you have to be aware of what to do in that kind of situation. You may not want to think about it but you have to."" Lt. Chris Crabtree led the slideshow and lecture presentation. ""Nobody believes it could happen in my town,"" he said. ""But it can."" Crabtree shared a story about he and his wife visiting Las Vegas two weeks before the mass shooting outside of the Mandalay Bay Hotel in which 58 people were fatally shot by a gunman. ""It was too close for comfort,"" Crabtree said. He and four other officers led the nearly two-hour session by emphasizing three key actions to take if anyone finds themselves in the crosshairs of an active shooter. ""Run, hide, fight,"" he and the others said. The program included details about characteristics of gunmen who have committed mass shootings, including often being angry, withdrawn and with a history of domestic violence, and predominantly men. They encouraged the audience to ""think like a cop"" and survey a room for exits and to ""arm yourself with a survival mindset."" They also spoke about what to do when police arrive, including to not be alarmed if an officer points a gun in your direction when determining where to find the gunman. Kinney observed the training from the back of the large, main room of his church. He already practices many of the precautions police recommend for keeping a sanctuary safe. ""We have a security team,"" Kinney said. ""They aren't armed but we have congregation members watching doors and hallways during our services. We also now have an on-duty a township police officer here when we have church service and have some off-duty members of our congregation. And sometimes, they're packing."" Kinney said small children are supervised in a separate wing of the sprawling church on Blackwood Clementon Road during church service. He said he has also taken a precaution of having a separate security member follow him from a distance to watch behind him when he is in the pulpit. ""I think it's very critical in this hour to partner with the police and anyone who can help us as a faith community to become aware of threats that are out there and to minimize the risk.""

Approximately 150 cyclists participated. (Sarah Alvarado, Contributing Photographer)  For the second year, more than 150 cyclists on Saturday paid tribute to the victims of the Dec. 2, 2015, mass shooting by riding the streets of Redlands and San Bernardino. Weidhase called the outpouring of support Saturday “amazing.” “Something like this ride brings all of us together,” he added. “Everyone has their way of commemorating the day, but seeing how the cycling community can come together to remember those who died is heart-warming, it really is.” The attack that left 14 dead and 22 wounded took place during a training session and holiday gathering for San Bernardino County’s Environmental Health Services Division at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. The attackers, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27, were killed hours later during a shootout 3 miles away. The 14-mile memorial ride was a way of showing the survivors and the victims’ families “that we’re not going to forget that day and we’re going to be strong and come together as a community,” said Alesandra Wilson, of Ride Yourself Fit, the Redlands cycling crew that helped organize the event. “This is not going to stop us.”  Moreland, a member of Ride Yourself Fit, had known Thalasinos for nine-plus years before Dec. 2, 2015. The 59-year-old said he speaks with Thalasinos’ widow, Jennifer, on a regular basis. The two talk about grief, about sleepless nights, about memories. “And to think there are 14 families going through the same thing,” Moreland said. “It’s amazing the ripple effect something like that has on the community, on people personally.” Munoz, a 9-1-1 dispatcher for the California Highway Patrol, answered the emergency phone call of a Dec. 2, 2015, survivor. Last year, Munoz participated in a memorial bike ride held by the San Bernardino Police Department. She said she shed tears that morning. Saturday, her 14-year-old son Jonathan tagged along. “Sometimes with these tragedies, it’s out of sight, out of mind,” Munoz said. “To me, this is an opportunity to remember what happened, what those people went through. The pain is always there.” Weidhase on Saturday retrieved a photo from his Facebook page of him standing shoulder to shoulder with other first responders on Dec. 2, 2015. A special agent at the time, Weidhase was involved in the fatal shootout. “I fought wars overseas,” the 49-year-old veteran said. “That day, the war came to us.”  Two years after the Dec. 2, tragedy, small remnants remain of the memorial at the corner of Waterman Ave. & Orange Show Rd, for the victims of the Inland Regional Center mass shooting in San Bernardino, Ca., Thursday, November 30, 2017.

236,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/513946818/0/phoenix/nation~Las-Vegas-security-guards-fatally-shot-in-hotelcasino/,"LAS VEGAS — Two Las Vegas security guards were fatally shot Saturday while investigating a disturbance in a room at a hotel-casino and the suspected shooter is facing critical injuries after turning the gun on himself, police said. The gunman’s motive wasn’t known but investigators believe it was an isolated incident. “I want you to know right now that this has nothing to do with terrorism,” Capt. Robert Plummer told reporters outside the scene of the shooting. The shooting happened before 7 a.m. at Arizona Charlie’s Decatur, which is located west of the Las Vegas Strip. According to police, the suspect, Christopher Olague, ran from the hotel-casino after the shooting and into a nearby neighborhood where he tried to enter two homes but the residents were able to keep him out. Police found him in a laundry room accessible through a garage of the second home after he appeared to have shot himself in the head, Lt. Dan McGrath said. According to McGrath, Olague tried to enter the first home with the intention of stealing a car and also tried to take a vehicle on the street. Police described Olague’s condition as a “non-survivable wound.” The victims’ identities were not released. Police said the uniformed security guards were a man and a woman in their 40s and that one was armed. Their identities and their causes of death will be released by Clark County Coroner’s Office. McGrath said the circumstances of what happened in the hotel room still unclear. The hotel-casino’s office did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The shooting comes a day before law enforcement officers expect tens of thousands of New Year’s Eve revelers on the Strip and three months after the city dealt with the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Officials have been trying to reassure residents and visitors that the city is safe, especially in the wake of the Oct. 1 shooting. A high-stakes gambler killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino on the Strip and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below.

Lawyers for Noor Salman had fought to move the case outside the city, arguing intense media coverage of the shooting could prompt bias in potential jurors. U.S. District Judge Paul Byron denied the request Tuesday, court documents show. Salman has been behind bars for nearly a year since her January arrest. She's facing federal charges of obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting by providing material support to a terrorist organization. If convicted, Salman could face life in prison. More: Hero cop of Pulse shooting is being terminated from force Trials are required to be held in the district where the alleged crime happens unless there is ""extraordinary local prejudice"" to prevent a fair trial, Byron wrote in the ruling, adding he didn't find anything that would merit a relocation. Lawyers for Salman, who lived in Fort Pierce, Fla., with Mateen and their toddler before the attack, argued news coverage by local, national and international media showed bias against her and was framed to make her appear guilty. The lawyers cited news stories, including several that included texts she and Mateen exchanged during his attack at the LGBT nightclub, which left 49 people dead and dozens more injured. The texts did not include the full context of their conversation and created an impression that she may have known about his plans, Salman's lawyers argued in court documents. More: FBI arrests wife of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen Byron noted that Salman shared the text messages with The New York Times in an interview after the attack. She also told the Times she saw Mateen watching jihadist videos and knew he'd been interviewed twice by the FBI, court documents show. Salman's lawyers also claimed Orlando Police Chief John Mina made a series of comments that could have created bias against her, including a Twitter post where he wrote he was glad she was charged. Byron said that point was moot because Mina never claimed Salman was guilty or spoke about any evidence law enforcement collected in the case against her. He said Mina's comments had a relatively small reach and the court encompasses more than 2.8 million people, a massive pool to find a fair jury. Attorneys are using the uncommon additional step of having potential jurors fill out questionnaires, which will help in the selection process, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Salman's trial is scheduled to start in March. ",2017-12-07 12:58:19,"Trial for wife of Pulse nightclub gunman will stay in Orlando, judge rules",,25128,http://www.azcentral.com
238,https://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/01/we-shouldnt-blame-illegal-immigrants-for-kate-steinles-death-we-should-blame-government/,"Trending: The death of Kate Steinle was a tragedy. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate shouldn’t have been in the country. And the government failed to do its job of protecting the public. But the exploitation of Steinle’s death by those who wish to smear illegal immigrants has done more to undermine rational debate about immigration policy than to facilitate it. On Thursday, Garcia Zarate was acquitted of murder, manslaughter and assault charges for the July 2015 killing of Steinle in San Francisco, but found guilty on a gun charge. Garcia Zarate, an illegal immigrant who has been deported five times in the past, is expected to be deported once again, according to the Associated Press. That Garcia Zarate was responsible for Steinle’s death has never been in question. What has been less clear is why and how Garcia Zarate ended up firing a weapon which wasn’t his and striking Steinle. An assessment of the events leading up to the shooting gives few indications that anyone could have predicted what was going to happen. For one, Garcia Zarate, who had no history of violence, was only in San Francisco after serving several years in federal prison for after being caught in 2009 for attempting to reenter the country after being deported. In March 2015, federal officials chose to honor a request from the San Francisco Sheriff’s office for Garcia Zarate to answer for a 20-year-old bench warrant pertaining to a $20 marijuana sale. The Department of Justice could have referred Garcia Zarate to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation. But they didn’t, and so Garcia Zarate was sent to San Francisco, where he was detained by the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department. On March 27, 2015, he arrived to San Francisco Superior Court, where the old, low-level charges were promptly dropped. The SFSD continued to detain him for weeks as they confirmed there were no active warrants and that he had indeed completed his federal prison sentence. During this time, ICE put in a detainer request to SFSD to detain Garcia Zarate until they picked him up. But as federal courts like the Oregon Federal District Court in Miranda-Olivares v. Clackamas County have ruled, detainer requests alone are not a sufficient basis to detain people in local jails, and thus detaining someone on the basis of a federal detainer request alone violates the Fourth Amendment. Consequently, when ICE failed to provide a request backed by a warrant, the SFSD released Garcia Zarate on April 15, three weeks after his arrival in San Francisco, having no legal justification for continuing to hold him. Months later, Garcia Zarate found himself on a San Francisco pier, came across a gun wrapped in a t-shirt which discharged, ricocheted on the pavement 12-15 feet away from him and traveled 78 feet away to strike Steinle in the back. Jurors were ultimately convinced there wasn’t any intent on the part of Garcia Zarate to kill Steinle, hence his acquittal. But while that makes sense in the constrained legal sense, the case has prompted much larger questions. At the broadest level, some have attempted to use the case to condemn illegal immigration in general. After news of the verdict broke, President Trump wrote via Twitter, “No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.” And it’s true, many people angry with illegal immigration look to cases like this as an example of what goes wrong when people are in the country illegally. But to use such cases as somehow representative of illegal immigration generally is nonsensical. It’s simply dishonest to compare Garcia Zarate to the millions of illegal immigrants who have lived productive lives in the United States, sometimes for decades, become homeowners, raised children and received college educations. To smear all illegal immigrants because of the terrible things a few of them do does nothing to seriously advance realistic, humane solutions to a complicated problem involving millions of people. It’s as useful as condemning all gun owners or white men after virtually every mass shooting. Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and pundits like Sean Hannity have taken to bashing San Francisco and suggesting its refusal to honor a detainer request is why Steinle is dead. While I understand that conservatives like bashing San Francisco, this idea is simply lazy. One could just as easily say Steinle is dead because of marijuana prohibition. After all, if marijuana wasn’t made illegal, there wouldn’t have been a crime for which to send Garcia Zarate to San Francisco in the first place. Or, more practically, one could say that the Bureau of Prisons is responsible because they chose to send Garcia Zarate to San Francisco rather than hold him for ICE. These are more directly relevant than San Francisco not wanting to violate the Fourth Amendment to honor a detainer request they legally don’t have to honor, because, as conservatives should appreciate, state and local law enforcement aren’t supposed to be commandeered by the federal government. While there are various alternate universes we can imagine to prevent Steinle’s death, we ultimately can’t change the past. But we can move forward in a sensible, reasonable manner. Stoking xenophobic delusions of an America under siege, disregarding federalism and attacking all illegal immigrants for the actions of one does nothing to move us forward.

243,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/506443072/0/phoenix/nation~biggest-pop-culture-moments-of/,"From the Oscars mix-up and Wonder Woman craze to the announcement of Beyoncé's babies and the #MeToo movement, a lot has happened in the last 12 months. Here are the top pop culture moments that helped define 2017. What happened: Presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway walked onstage with the wrong envelope and announced that La La Land was best picture, instead of actual winner Moonlight. The La La Land team had already begun thanking people before producer Jordan Horowitz took to the mike to announce the mix-up. “Sorry, guys, hold on. There's a mistake. Moonlight, you guys won best picture. This is not a joke.” Why it was a big deal: The best-picture award is the highest film honor in Hollywood, and an Oscar for Moonlight would’ve been a newsworthy underdog win even if the best-picture announcement was flub-free. The indie film, about a gay man confronting his identity, is the first winner to tell a story primarily about and starring black people that isn’t about racism, the civil rights movement or slavery. More: Here's how the worst flub in Oscar history went down More: Don’t let the Oscars' mix-up ruin legacy of ‘Moonlight’ What happened: Grande was performing at the Manchester Arena in northwestern England in May when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device, killing at least 22 people and injuring more than 100. Why it was a big deal: The tragedy renewed the public's concerns with concert safety, and prompted the Department of Homeland Security to say there is no evidence of credible threats against music venues in the U.S. Grande's sold-out benefit, which was planned after the first terror attack, was held in June. The event became a unifier for thousands of attendees and several guests, including Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber. The joy and dancing from the event was so contagious, even a police officer was caught on camera enjoying the music. Grande went on to become one of the most-followed celebrities in 2017, with 22 million new Instagram followers, putting her total at more than 115 million. More: Undaunted, Ariana Grande leads emotional One Love show for Manchester A dancing policeman won Twitter at Ariana Grande's Manchester concert What happened: A gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, killing 58 and injuring more than 500. Why it was a big deal: The incident has been called the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history. It caused performers to cancel tour dates. And it put a spotlight back on issues of live event safety and gun control. However, despite calls for legislative action, proposals including those to expand background checks on firearms haven’t gotten anywhere. The event specifically impacted the world of country music: Jason Aldean, who was performing at the time of the shooting, visited victims in the hospital; The Country Music Association asked journalists not to talk about the tragedy and gun control at the CMAs, but reversed its decision at the urging of Brad Paisley and others; and country stars, including Caleb Keeter, spoke out about gun control for the first time. More: CMA apologizes, lifts media restrictions at CMA Awards More: Las Vegas mass shooting raises new doubts about safety of live entertainment What happened: Men and women spoke out about harassment, using the hashtag #MeToo, in the wake of the news that movie producer Harvey Weinstein was accused by dozens of women of predatory sexual behavior spanning decades, which The New York Times and The New Yorker first reported in October. Harvey Weinstein scandal: A complete list of the 83 accusers Why it was a big deal: The accusations led to Weinstein's downfall: He was fired from the production company he started and figuratively blacklisted. Then, more high-powered Hollywood men fell. The #MeToo movement incited a deluge of sexual harassment and assault allegations. As a result, famous faces in movies, TV and elsewhere, including Kevin Spacey, Matt Lauer and Louis CK, have been summarily fired. What happened: Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria tore through Texas, Florida, the Caribbean and parts of the Southeast in August and September. The storms caused massive flooding, power outages and devastation for millions. Celebrities including Jennifer Lopez, Kevin Hart, J.J. Watt, Ellen Degeneres and the Kardashians challenged others to donate to hurricane aid organizations assisting victims. Lin-Manuel Miranda rounded up fellow Latino artists for the charity song Almost Like Praying to aid Puerto Rico, while Beyoncé, Justin Bieber and Oprah were among the celebs featured at the Hand in Hand telethon for victims of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Hurricane Harvey: Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight Show' to donate $1 million to J.J. Watt effort Why it was a big deal: Celebrities from various backgrounds came togethe, raising millions of dollars through social media, multiple telethons and charity songs to benefit victims of the storms. Lin-Manuel Miranda explains his new song for Puerto Rico, those Trump tweets We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST What happened: Beyoncé took to Instagram in February to announce her pregnancy — with twins! The elaborate photo shoot was the most-liked picture on Instagram for the year, with more than 11.1 million likes, and was only rivaled by her first photo — garnering more than 10.2 million likes — presenting her newborn babies, Rumi and Sir, to the world in July. Why it was a big deal: It’s Queen Bey. What happened: The world’s most eligible royal bachelor was taken off the market in November with the news that he’s engaged to actress Meghan Markle. The announcement came a couple months after the couple made their first appearance together at Harry’s Invictus Games in Toronto. Why it’s a big deal: Markle is the most atypical royal bride ever: She's a divorced, biracial, Jewish American. What happened: Kimmel became the face of health care in entertainment when he opened up about his infant son’s health problems and emotionally pleaded for affordable health care coverage for all. His son, Billy, has had two surgeries to help treat his pre-existing heart condition. Why it was a big deal: Health care reform was one of the tenets of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and major changes to the Affordable Care Act have fallen short in Congress since Trump’s inauguration. Kimmel often used his opening monologues to try to hold the administration and lawmakers accountable. Emotional Jimmy Kimmel discusses baby son's heart surgery What happened: The 1985 novel by Margaret Atwood got a critically acclaimed screen adaptation on Hulu in April. The series, a dystopian tale of a group of women forced to become breeders under a new regime, was seen as more relevant than ever to anti-Trump audiences. Why it’s a big deal: The show struck a chord with viewers. Not only did Handmaid’s Tale win five Emmys, including best drama, but women wore the red robes and white bonnets to courtrooms, and eventually the U.S. Capitol, as a way to protest bills seen as restricting women’s rights. Review: ‘Handmaid’s Tale’ is a wake-up call for women What happened: Look what you made her do. Taylor Swift returned after a year out of the public eye with a new look and a new album, Reputation. She also announced a massive 2018 tour. Why it was a big deal: Swift’s album sold more than 1.2 million copies in its first week, becoming 2017’s fastest and best-selling album. How Taylor Swift's 'Reputation' beat streaming to become 2017's best-selling album What happened: Kendall Jenner appeared in a tone-deaf ad for Pepsi, which showed the model joining a protest in the streets and handing a police officer a can of the soda to help calm the tension. The wildly negative response to the ad caused Pepsi to pull the commercial and issue an apology. Why it was a big deal: The commercial appeared to make light of serious issues and the Black Lives Matter movement. Having Jenner — who has been accused of cultural appropriation along with other members of her famous family — at the center of the ad did not help. And it was problematic for Jenner, who became the highest-paid model of the year and top model as far as mentions on Tumblr. Twitter takes Pepsi to task over tone-deaf Kendall Jenner ad What happened: Millions of women, and men, marched in Washington, Los Angeles, New York and other cities across the world in January as a direct response to Trump's inauguration. The attendees marched to advocate for legislation involving women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and immigration reform, among other issues. Hundreds of celebrities joined the cause, speaking on stage at the various marches and walking alongside attendees. Why it was a big deal: The marches helped lay the foundation for the current #MeToo movement, creating an environment where women could speak openly about their experiences and sparking other marches against injustices. The most memorable quotes from the Women's March on Washington ❤️ #Repost @arod ・・・ Happy Birthday to Us!!! #leos 🇩🇴🇵🇷 #305 A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Jul 23, 2017 at 3:01am PDT What happened: Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez made their official debut as a couple at the Met Gala in May, and it’s been nothing but cute Instagram photos and loving interviews about their relationship ever since. The picture that Lopez re-posted from Rodriguez was her most-liked picture on Instagram for the year, picking up more than 1.6 million likes. Why it was a big deal: There have been a lot of tragedies in 2017, so romance between two of the world’s biggest stars is a silver lining. Inside Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez' lavish 'baecation' What happened: In March, Netflix released the first season of 13 Reasons Why, the adaptation of a 2007 novel about a high school girl, Hannah, who commits suicide and leaves a series of tapes explaining the lead-up to her death. The show immediately became a talker on social media. Why it’s a big deal: The show sparked fears around the way suicide was depicted, and of teenage viewers making light of Hannah's death. The meme “welcome to your tape” was born. Meanwhile, the show encouraged families to have serious discussions of teen suicide after many viewers complained about the way the topic was handled. The controversial series has been renewed for a second season. What happened: Wonder Woman became the best-reviewed DC Universe film and a box-office hero when it hit theaters in May. The Gal Gadot-led film already has a sequel in the works. Why it's a big deal: Wonder Woman had the biggest opening ever for a movie directed by a woman with a $100.5 million debut, and presented a turning point for female representation on the big screen. Seeing the feminist film became an event, with fans dressing in Wonder Woman garb and posting about the movie to social media. Wonder Woman was the most-talked-about movie on Tumblr, and Gal Gadot was the second-most-popular actress mentioned on the social media site. Review: 'Wonder Woman' is the fresh, hopeful superhero movie we need ",2017-12-06 17:33:19,15 biggest pop culture moments of 2017,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com
244,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/510479214/0/phoenix/nation~Year-in-review-stories-from-states-that-moved-us-in/,"The year began with Donald Trump assuming the mantle of 45th president of the United States. The day after he was inaugurated, more than two million people across the world called for a ""revolution"" as a bulwark against the new administration they feared would roll back reproductive, civil and human rights. The year that followed was no less dramatic. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was ousted from the White House over his Russian contacts. NFL players continued to kneel. There were multiple data breaches, but none larger than Equifax, which compromised the personal information of nearly half of all Americans. Inevitably, there was tragedy. The catastrophic 2017 hurricane season brought us Harvey, Irma and Maria, which Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico will spend years recovering from. New York City saw its worst terrorist attack since 9/11. In Las Vegas, 58 people died in the worst mass shooting in American history. But there was also wonder. For the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. We celebrated the news that one of our own, California native Meghan Markle, is set to wed Prince Harry and become the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family. In the end, 2017 closes with hope. Women punctuated the year with the powerful rallying cry #metoo, prompting a national reckoning on a culture of sexual violence that has persisted unabated for far too long. After another eventful year, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state — the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about. Alabama: Roy Moore and America’s reckoning on sexual violence The eyes of a nation were fixed on Alabama this December to see who the state would choose to take over its open Senate seat in an election that was seen not only as a referendum on President Trump — who supported embattled Republican candidate Roy Moore — but also on the country's tolerance of predatory sexual behavior. Trump was elected in spite of more than a dozen allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. But Moore, who was accused in November of sexually assaulting and harassing multiple teenage girls when he was in his 30s, was defeated by Democrat Doug Jones. It is the first time in 25 years that Alabama has elected a Democrat to the Senate. The Alabama special election came during what America has come to refer to as its ""post-Weinstein moment,"" a reckoning on powerful men who have abused women with impunity, and who, until recently, rarely faced consequences. Since the reports Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein harassed, abused and assaulted more than 80 women over several decades, women around the country who have long suffered in silence flooded social media under the hashtag #metoo and made public statements about the sexual misconduct they've endured. For many Americans, this reckoning is complicated by Trump's presence in the White House. Trump's accusers have revived calls for a congressional investigation into his misconduct. Some say Jones’ victory will embolden Democrats to do just that. Alaska: Fear of climate change rises after U.S. leaves Paris Accord In 2017, America became the only country on Earth not part of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Trump decided to leave the pact in June. The Paris agreement, negotiated by former president Barack Obama, aims to combat global warming by gradually reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In Alaska, climate change is always front-of-mind. Many residents of Sarichef Island and an Iñupiaq village of 650 blame human-caused climate change for accelerating the island’s erosion and fear leaving the Paris agreement will supercharge destruction that's already occurring. Arizona: McCain, battling brain cancer, stops Obamacare repeal It was a tense July night on the Senate floor when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. — roughly a week after announcing his brain cancer diagnosis — sunk the GOP-backed ""skinny repeal"" of Obamacare with a dramatic ""thumbs down."" Before the vote, congressional leaders had struggled to reach consensus on a plan to replace former president Barack Obama's signature health care law, which the GOP had promised for seven years to expunge the law from the books. Republicans ultimately scrapped a vote on a last-ditch Obamacare repeal effort in September, which McCain also opposed. As for his health, McCain said in September he would continue treatments for brain cancer while also doing his job on Capitol Hill. Arkansas: Controversial Ten Commandments monument destroyed after less than 24 hours After years of fierce debate, Arkansas built a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol building. Less than 24 hours later, the monument was razed. Michael Tate Reed, 32, plowed his car through the statue while filming the incident on his cellphone and posting the video on Facebook, authorities said. The 6-foot, 6,000-pound memorial drew the ire of opponents like the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Temple of Satan, who said the monument was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. Supporters saw it as a way to celebrate the role the Ten Commandments played in this country’s law. State Sen. Jason Rapert, who led the push to initially erect the monument, vowed to raise funds to build its replacement. California: Meghan Markle, America's fairy-tale royal bride Royal wedding bells are ringing yet again. Suits actress and California native Meghan Markle is set to wed Prince Harry, the world's most eligible royal bachelor. The couple announced their engagement in November. Markle, who was raised in Los Angeles, will make history as the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family. After they wed, Harry will likely receive a new royal title as a duke from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and Markle will, like Duchess Kate, be known as a titled royal duchess, HRH Meghan, Duchess of so-and-so. Also in royals: Prince William and Kate Middleton announced they are expecting their third child. Sister Pippa Middleton's May wedding was the A-list event of the year. Colorado: Baker's confections vs. gay couple's affections In 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins went into baker Jack Phillips' Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colo., to buy a cake for their wedding. But Phillips doesn't do cakes for same-sex weddings. Craig and Mullins said Phillips' refusal violated a Colorado anti-discrimination law. Five years later, their disagreement over a cake went all the way to the Supreme Court in a case testing the Constitution's guarantee of free speech and religion against state laws prohibiting discrimination. The court, bolstered in April by the addition of stalwart conservative and fellow Coloradan Neil Gorsuch, appeared split down the middle when the justices heard oral arguments Dec. 5. The decision, which will likely hinge on Justice Anthony Kennedy, isn't expected until next year. Connecticut: Hate crime, or roommate feud gone too far? In late October, former University of Hartford student Briana Brochu was charged with breach of peace and criminal mischief for tampering with items that belonged to her roommate, who is black. Brochu admitted she licked Chennel ""Jazzy"" Rowe's eating utensils and smeared bodily fluids on her backpack. Rowe posted a Facebook video about the incident, which quickly viral, and prompted backlash on social media as many questioned whether Brochu's actions were racially motivated. The Connecticut NAACP and others called on Hartford prosecutors to file a hate crime charge against Brochu, but Brochu's lawyer, Thomas Stevens, told the Hartford Courant he does not believe the charge will be added. Stevens told the paper there was nothing ""racial that motivated"" the incident, and said they were simply roommates who did not get along. Delaware: Beau's death convinced Joe Biden not to run for president Had he run for president, Joe Biden believes he would have taken the oath of office Jan. 20 rather than the train home to Wilmington. The former vice president and Delaware senator, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom days before leaving office, revealed in his emotional book that he originally considered staying out of the 2016 race to pave the way for his son Beau's budding political career, and Beau’s death following a brutal bout with cancer ultimately convinced him it wasn’t the time to make the run. So what about a 2020 push? He hasn’t ruled it out quite yet. Florida: Irma devastates the Gulf coast Hurricane Irma sawed up Florida's Gulf coast in early September, the strongest hurricane the Sunshine State had faced in a decade. Its slow crawl toward Florida caused a run on hardware store and grocery essentials, while evacuation orders threw the state's highways into a standstill. After it pummeled Key West, the storm struck the Naples area, taking down trees and causing flooding across the state. All told, millions lost power and dozens died, including 14 people at a Hollywood nursing home, where a power outage left residents in sweltering conditions for three days. It sparked a criminal investigation in which 12 of the deaths were deemed homicides. Now, state lawmakers seek laws requiring assisted living facilities to have generators. Georgia: Equifax data breach leaves millions of consumers vulnerable Atlanta-based company Equifax, once trusted to handle our credit scores, has become a pariah of the financial world since hackers stole the vital information of 145 million Americans in Equifax’s system. The breach announced this September included Social Security numbers, names, addresses and dates of birth. How did Equifax get into the mess? A security patch for a known system bug was issued but Equifax hadn’t installed it. Lawmakers asked questions, the CEO resigned, and a good chunk of America freaked out. One way consumers tried to protect themselves was by freezing their credit, but since everyone tried to do it at once, there were problems. Here's how to protect yourself from a breach. Hawaii: Trump travel ban found trouble in paradise The Aloha State was not a welcoming place for President Trump's plans to ban travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. The administration issued three versions of the ban in 2017 and all three were blocked by a federal judge in Hawaii. But despite the Hawaii bench’s best efforts to thwart the ban, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this month that Trump’s order can take full effect while legal challenges against the latest version are still tied up in courts. By allowing the full travel ban to take effect for now, the justices may be signaling that they are likely to uphold it on the merits at a later date. Idaho: Bergdahl avoids jail time for disappearing from Afghanistan base Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army soldier who disappeared from his base in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, avoided jail time despite pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior in front of the enemy. Former president Barack Obama won freedom for the Idaho native in 2014 by negotiating a prisoner swap with the Taliban militants. His case even became the subject of the second season of the podcast Serial. Bergdahl faced a life sentence for abandoning his post, but a military judge ruled to reduce him in rank to private and dishonorably discharge him. President Trump slammed the decision in a tweet, calling it, ""a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military."" Illinois: Conspiracy, obstruction charges in Laquan McDonald killing The dash cam footage was chilling. Sixteen shots fired at Laquan McDonald as the 17-year-old walked away from police. Now prosecutors say three Chicago police officers were trying to ""conceal the true facts"" in McDonald's death. A Cook County grand jury indicted the officers in June with state charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and misconduct. ""These defendants did more than merely obey an unofficial 'code of silence,'"" special prosecutor Patricia Brown Holmes said of the alleged coverup. Officer Jason Van Dyke previously pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trail on first-degree murder charges. Indiana: A canceled wedding, but love prevails When an Indiana couple called off their $30,000 wedding a week before the big day, they were stuck with a non-refundable reception. What did would-be bride Sarah Cummins do? She invited guests from four area homeless shelters. Her generosity inspired a local man to donate suits for guests, his tailor donated a few more and another local business contributed dresses and accessories. The July dinner, which included chicken, salmon, wedding cake and even a late-night snack of pizza, turned a painful situation positive, Cummins said. She now volunteers for a center for homeless families in Indianapolis. Iowa: A giant wave connects sick kids to the outside world The new children's hospital practically hangs over the University of Iowa's Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City. Before the season kicked off, a fan named Krista Young had an idea: ""Kinnick should hold a 'wave to the kids' minute during every game."" The Facebook post went viral and on Sept. 2, when the Hawkeyes' football team hosted the Wyoming Cowboys, 68,000-plus fans rose, turned to the hospital and offered a long, sustained wave to sick children — some of whom haven't left in months — gathered near the windows to watch the game. Kristen Brown, a nurse at the Stead Family Children's Hospital, said the now-regular waves connect kids to the outside world. ""Anytime we can make them feel normal and a part of something, it's very meaningful,"" she said. Kansas: Principal resigns after student newspaper questions her credentials A team of high school journalism students in Kansas published an investigative story questioning their incoming principal's qualifications. And then she resigned. The student reporters received national recognition after they revealed that Amy Robertson, their would-be new principal, received her master's and doctoral degrees from Corllins University, an unaccredited online school. Robertson, who currently works with an education consulting firm in Dubai, said she received her degrees before the university lost accreditation. The Pittsburg School Board accepted Robertson's resignation in April. Kentucky: Passenger's removal from United flight sparks uproar On April 9, Kentucky doctor David Dao was shown on video being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville. Dao was among four passengers scheduled to be removed to accommodate crew members. The footage of Dao screaming as he was pulled from the plane went viral. Days later, Dao's lawyer said he suffered a concussion and broken nose. The incident prompted United to make changes to its passenger policies. Two security officers involved in the incident were fired. Louisiana: 'I'm back': Steve Scalise returns to Congress after shooting With two words, ""I'm back,"" Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise tweeted his remarkable return to the U.S. Capitol after a gunman critically wounded him during a congressional baseball team practice on June 14 outside Washington, D.C. Four others were shot before the gunman was killed. Scalise was discharged from the hospital six weeks later to begin a process of intensive rehabilitation. On September 28, Scalise got back to work, tweeting a photo of him and his wife Jennifer looking out at the National Mall from the Capitol. His return to the House floor was met by a standing ovation. ""You have no idea how great this feels to be back here at work in the people's House."" Maine: Thousands send Christmas cards to dying boy Jacob Thompson just wanted to celebrate one more Christmas. The 9-year-old from Maine, who had been diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma in February 2014, made a simple request when he was admitted to the hospital in October and was told he had only a month to live: Send Christmas cards. Tens of thousands of cards flew into Jacob's small hospital room as the boy's story captured the hearts of people across the nation. Having a love for penguins, he even got a special visit when the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut brought the tuxedo birds to meet their young fan. Thompson died Nov. 19. Maryland: The day the NFL took a knee NFL players responded in full force on a Sunday in September after President Trump repeatedly called for punishing players who didn’t stand during the national anthem. In the first game that day, a number of teammates from the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars either knelt or locked arms at a high-profile game in London. Landover, Md.-based Washington Redskins players stood with arms locked, though some players chose to kneel. And across the league demonstrations spread, as many players broke out of their routine by joining the protests or engaging in team-wide displays of unity. The protests first began in the 2016 season, when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick said it was his way of speaking out against racial injustice and police brutality. Massachusetts: Michelle Carter gets 15 months in prison for texting boyfriend to commit suicide ""You can't think about it. You just have to do it. You said you were gonna do it."" Michelle Carter, 20, sent dozens of texts like this encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy III, 18, to commit suicide, which Roy eventually did after Carter instructed him to get back in a truck filling with carbon monoxide. Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, of which she'll serve 15 months. The case was the first to determine the legality of telling someone to commit suicide. Legal experts are concerned that it could set a bad legal precedent. Michigan: '90s grunge lost an icon in Chris Cornell Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell's distinctive, nearly four-octave wail was nearly synonymous with the grunge-music era of the 1990s. Just hours after performing for a Detroit crowd in May, the 52-year-old was found unresponsive in his hotel room. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office ruled the death a suicide by hanging, although his family questioned the findings. Cornell was just one among many celebrities we lost this year. Minnesota: #MeToo movement hits Minnesota hard Democratic Senator Al Franken announced his resignation in December after more than a half dozen women said he touched them improperly or made unwanted sexual advances. Franken disputed some accusations and suggested he was being held to a different standard than President Trump. Franken became the second member of Congress to announce his resignation due to sexual harassment allegations in 2017. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a civil rights icon first elected to the House in 1964, stepped down after several women accused him of harassment. Franken's fellow Minnesotan Garrison Keillor, the iconic Prairie Home Companion host, was fired in November after allegations of ""inappropriate behavior."" Mississippi: Bringing 'insane asylum' dead back to life Up to 7,000 dead bodies are buried underneath the University of Mississippi Medical Center campus. They are former patients of the state's first mental institution, called simply the Insane Asylum, built in 1855. Underground radar shows the coffins stretch across 20 acres of the campus. UMMC discovered 66 coffins while doing construction on the campus in 2013, but has since detected thousands more. UMMC is now teaming up with a professor from Millsaps College in Jackson for a possible National Endowment of Humanities grant that would fund a study of the asylum and its history as well as engage families whose ancestors lived there. The center is looking at exhuming the bodies, and preserving as well as studying the remains. Missouri: Girl mistakes elk for deer, shoots it dead, story goes viral Abby Wilson, 14, was hunting alone when she said she spotted a very large white-tailed deer and pulled the trigger. The problem? It wasn't a deer. It was an elk. Her father, Donald White, immediately called the conservation department upon realizing his daughter's mistake. Because there's no elk hunting season in Missouri, the animals are protected and wildlife officials are determining whether to issue any citations or warnings to the young hunter. After the story went viral, White said comments directed at her, including that she should be locked up, amounted to bullying. Montana: Body slam shows just one of many threats facing journalists The first year of the Trump era was a tough one for American journalists. On top of competing with ""alternative facts"" and being labeled the ""enemy of the American people"" by the president, some reporters were physically stopped from doing their jobs. In May, wealthy businessman Greg Gianforte, who was running for Montana's open House seat, was arrested for assaulting Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on the eve of the election. Gianforte won over Montana voters but apparently lied to investigators after the body slam. Nebraska: Sasse sasses Trump It's no secret that Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse took his fair share of jabs at President Trump this year. The young Republican from Plainview recently asked the president if he was ""recanting"" his oath of office following an apparent threat of the freedom of the press. He also called out Trump for his Twitter attack on the hosts of MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" saying ""it's beneath the dignity of your office."" Sasse's and other GOP legislators', well, sass, highlights Trump's struggle to make nice with Republicans on Capitol Hill. Nevada: Deadliest year for mass killings in more than a decade On Oct. 1, America changed forever when a gunman shattered his hotel windows at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas and opened fire on 22,000 country music fans at the outdoor Route 91 Harvest Festival. Fifty-eight would die in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Nearly 500 were injured. The gunman's motive remains a mystery. A wounded country came together again in November when a gunman killed 25 people, including a pregnant woman whose unborn baby also died, during a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas. With that, 2017 earned a bitter honor of being the most deadly year for mass killings in the U.S. in more than a decade. Three of the five largest mass killings — in Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. — have taken place since June 2016. New Hampshire: Voter fraud or bogus claims? Following the 2016 election, President Trump called for a crackdown on voter fraud. Trump claimed he lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused to New Hampshire to cast illegal votes against him. The solution? A voter fraud election commission was set up to investigate the matter. To date, legal experts and the New Hampshire deputy secretary of state said there is no evidence of voter fraud and the commission itself seems to have gone dark in recent weeks, with the last meeting held Sept. 12 in the Granite State. New Jersey: Chris Christie feels the heat over 'beachgate' Just before the Fourth of July, Governor Chris Christie was spotted lounging outside his residence on Island Beach State Park. The only problem? He'd just closed that beach to the public — and all the other state parks in New Jersey — thanks to a state government shutdown. The photo became the source of endless memes, and New Jersey residents told the governor to ""get the hell off the beach!"" A few weeks before ""beachgate,"" a poll found Christie's approval ratings had sunk to 15%, making him the least popular governor in any state in the past 20 years. After legislators struck a deal in ending the three day shutdown in time for the holiday, Christie announced he was headed right back to the beach. New Mexico: Plague found, and this isn't the first time The plague, once called the Black Death, wiped out nearly half of the European population in the Middle Ages. And while it sounds like a disease that should have no place in modern times, each spring and summer cases pop up, often in Western areas. In late June, New Mexico confirmed a total of three cases of the plague in Santa Fe County. According to the New Mexico Department of Health, all three were hospitalized and later released. So, how does one get the plague? It’s typically transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, and while terrifying sounding, it can be treated if the symptoms are recognized early. New York: Terror in NYC It was New York City's worst terrorist attack since 9/11, and occurred just a few blocks away from where the iconic twin towers crumbled. This November, Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan with ties to the Islamic State, ran down cyclists and pedestrians on a busy bike path before crashing into a school bus, killing 8 people and injuring 12. Saipov's killings occurred mere hours before the city's annual Halloween parade was to kick off, but revelers were undeterred. Amid heavier police presence, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio joined a million people who marched and danced down 6th Avenue in defiance of terror. De Blasio said, ""What New Yorkers showed already is we will not change, we will not be cowed, we will not be thrown off by anything."" North Carolina: Gerrymandering case struck down case, but what’s next? The United States Supreme Court in June struck down dozens of state legislative districts in North Carolina because they disadvantaged black voters. Then, federal judges rejected a request by North Carolina voters to hold special elections next March in new districts once lines are redrawn to eliminate illegal racial gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the deliberate process of redrawing lines to sway electoral outcomes in favor of a certain political party. As Karl Rove once said: ""He who controls redistricting can control Congress."" The issue has also been disputed in other states across the USA this year, particularly Wisconsin, which has a gerrymandering case before the Supreme Court with far-reaching national implications. North Dakota: Dakota Access Pipeline flows amid controversy After months of protests from environmental groups and Native American activists, the Army said it would allow the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota, completing the disputed project. The 1,200-mile pipeline began transporting crude oil on June 1 from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution hub in Illinois. Activists renewed calls to shut it down after a federal judge ruled the Army Corps of Engineers complied with some, but not all, requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act before issuing a permit. The developer of the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, has since filed a $1 billion federal lawsuit against several environmental groups accusing them of fraud, eco-terrorism and participation in a criminal enterprise. Ohio: Otto Warmbier's death, and a year of high-stakes tension with North Korea The death of Ohio native Otto Warmbier was a heartbreaking moment in a year of marked tensions with North Korea. Warmbier, a college student at the University of Virginia, was arrested in North Korea on charges of trying to steal a poster. The 22-year-old was returned home in June in a coma; he died shortly thereafter. Pyongyang denied it tortured or mistreated him, claiming Warmbier contracted botulism and was given a sleeping pill. Throughout 2017, President Trump and Kim Jong Un, whom Trump dubbed ""Little Rocket Man,"" exchanged ever more heated threats over North Korea's rapid development of nuclear weapons that could strike the U.S. mainland. Oklahoma: Another blow to Black Lives Matter ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" became a rallying cry after Michael Brown was killed in 2014 in Ferguson, Mo. Terence Crutcher had his hands up. Police shot. In May, a jury acquitted of first-degree manslaughter white Tulsa officer Betty Jo Shelby, who says she fired out of fear last year when she killed 40-year-old Crutcher. His family burst into tears at the verdict. In a video of the incident, the Tulsa Police Department can be heard saying Crutcher ""looks like a bad dude."" Crutcher's twin sister later said, ""That 'big bad dude' was a father ... a son."" The controversial verdict led to protests from Black Lives Matter. Shelby has since resigned from the Tulsa Police Department. Oregon: The Great American Eclipse captivates a nation For the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. Americans paused and enjoyed some unity as the moon passed between the sun and the Earth. Many traveled to the path of totality to experience the eerie darkness. From coast to coast, Americans watched — hopefully while wearing eclipse glasses — as the moon's shadow traced its 67-mile wide path across the country starting in Oregon. Those 2-3 minutes of darkness brought millions of tourist dollars to hotels, campgrounds, restaurants and museums in cities in the eclipse path. Pennsylvania: They gave him 18 drinks. Then, left him to die The horrifying death of a 19-year-old fraternity pledge captured on video exposed dangerous hazing rituals by members of Penn State University's Beta Theta Pi. After frat brothers gave Timothy Piazza 18 drinks in less than one hour and 22 minutes, his blood-alcohol content was about four times the legal limit for driving. Piazza was found unconscious in the basement the next day and later died. At least two dozen face charges in the case. Three other pledges across the nation died this year in Greek-related drinking incidents. Rhode Island: Michael Flynn, and the role of Russia in the 2016 election Despite being one of the most vulnerable figures in special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn remained beloved in his Rhode Island hometown in 2017. Flynn was ousted from the White House just weeks after President Trump's inauguration over his Russian contacts, and in December, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn is among four campaign aides charged so far in Mueller's investigation. Flynn is the only one who served in Trump's administration. The only other guilty plea is George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign associate Rick Gates have been charged and pleaded not guilty. In addition to Mueller's investigation, three Congressional committees are looking at Russia. South Carolina: Governor stands by Trump amid sanctuary city crackdown South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made it clear in October that the Palmetto State would not tolerate any cities acting as sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. The governor's strong condemnation of sanctuary cities came months after President Trump's executive order cracking down on cities that limit cooperation with immigration agencies. Following the order, leaders of some of the nation's biggest cities, including New York City, Chicago, and Boston, flatly stated they would not cooperate with the president. In November, a federal judge permanently blocked Trump's executive order on sanctuary cities. South Dakota: Old gold mine might hold treasured info on why we exist Researchers are in search of a different kind of treasure in a rural South Dakota gold mine: potential secrets explaining how the universe was created. The mine in Lead, S.D., that once hosted gold rushes in the 1800s will serve as home to scientists participating in the largest U.S.-based particle physics experiment. The experiment will determine whether particles called neutrinos help explain our existence. Over the next 10 years, workers will remove more than 870,000 tons of rock and install a four-story, 70,000-ton neutrino detector. The collaboration will involve 1,000 scientists from more than 30 countries. Tennessee: Tuition-free community college Tennessee students can put away their checkbooks if community colleges are in their future. In May, the southern state became the first to offer a tuition-free education to nearly every resident without a degree. Even though Tennessee was the first state to pass the measure, it isn't without precursors. New York legislators passed a budget in April that covered tuition for families making less than $100,000 a year. In February, San Francisco voters passed a tax measure that would cover community college tuition for anyone who lived in the city for more than a year, though the state of California did not follow suit. Texas: Hurricane Harvey hit hard Hurricane Harvey's historic downpour brought destruction to the Texas Gulf coast. Harvey killed dozens, dumped more than 50 inches of rain and drove thousands from their homes. Its effects will be felt for months and years into the future. Amid the destruction, people stepped up to help. There was Houston Texans star J.J. Watt raising more than $37 million in online donations, human chains pulling people to safety and an impromptu gospel singing performance at a shelter. Watt perhaps put it best: ""When times are the toughest, humanity stands at its strongest."" Utah: Outcry over nurse's arrest for refusing to draw unconscious patient's blood A Utah police officer was fired after he arrested a nurse who refused to let him draw blood from an unconscious patient without a warrant. Body cam footage of the arrest shows Detective Jeff Payne dragging Alex Wubbels from University Hospital while she sobs ""this is crazy."" An investigation was opened after video of the arrest went viral, and Wubbels received a $500,000 settlement from the city and the university that runs the hospital. She said she would give a portion of the settlement to the nurses union and help lead a campaign to stop physical and verbal abuse of nurses on the job. Vermont: This 13-year-old wants to be governor Ethan Sonneborn, 13, has some lofty political ambitions. The young Democrat announced this summer that he's running for governor in 2018, and with Vermont's founders imposing no age requirement for its highest office, his path to power is a little easier. The Bristol resident follows the news closely, chooses his words deliberately and sees his age as an asset, not a liability. ""We elected our oldest president ever,"" Sonneborn said, ""and he tweets like a kindergartner."" His views on the president echo those of prominent Vermont progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told USA TODAY one year after the election that Trump's presidency is an ""unprecedented disaster."" A hot topic Sonneborn would have to address if elected: recreational marijuana. Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a legalization bill in May, a decision with which Sonneborn took issue. Virginia: White supremacy in Charlottesville It's 2017, and there were neo-Nazis in the streets. In August, hundreds of white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis descended upon Charlottesville, Va., for a ""Unite the Right"" rally to protest the removal of a Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally turned violent when James Alex Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, who had expressed support for neo-Nazi positions, drove his car at high speed into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. President Trump was reticent to condemn the white supremacists, saying ""many sides"" were to blame for the violence. After his comments, Heyer's mother said she wouldn't take phone calls from the president. The rally was headlined by far-right white nationalist Richard Spencer, who returned to the city for another protest in October. Here's why Charlottesville has become ground zero for white supremacists. Washington: Amazon's new dome home Amazon joined Apple and Google in the race to build futuristic tech headquarters, introducing the Spheres, three (you guessed it) spheres that will ""round"" out the Seattle cityscape. The tallest of the glass and metal orbs rises 90 feet and is more than 130 feet in diameter, with two smaller spheres on each side. The space will host up to 800 employees for potential meetings, meals and mingling. It will also feature plenty of plant life, along with tree-house meeting rooms, a river and waterfalls, and a green ""bird's nest"" conference room. The rest of the public can visit through shops located near the entrance or by signing up for tours once it opens next year. West Virginia: Coal country digs Trump West Virginia, once a Democratic stronghold, is now Trump country. West Virginia’s conservative shift has been so pronounced that Gov. Jim Justice changed his political stripes in August and flipped from Democrat to Republican after just seven months in office. The state hasn't gone Democrat in a presidential election since 1996, and Hillary Clinton lost there by more than 40%. President Trump, who promised to bring coal mining jobs back, also got 77% of the vote in the Republican primary there. Trump took a lot of heat for politicizing the Boy Scout Jamboree held in West Virginia in July (prompting an apology from the Boy Scouts) but he was right back in the state the following week to rally the base and tout an end to ""war on beautiful clean coal."" Wisconsin: Blacked-out vacationers suspect tainted booze Abbey Conner went on a family vacation to an all-inclusive Mexican resort in January, but shortly after arriving, she was found face down in the pool, brain dead. Connor's death days later sparked a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that found 100-plus people saying they blacked out from moderate to light drinking at Mexican resorts. Some were robbed. Others were raped. Few ever found justice. The State Department issued an alert about possibly tainted or counterfeit alcohol. Mexican officials swept tourist spots and claimed to seize 10,000 gallons of illegal booze from a shoddy distributer. They reported no such evidence at the resort where Connor drowned. Wyoming: Trump national parks moves met with backlash This year may have been your last chance to visit Yellowstone without doling out $70 to do so. The Trump administration in October proposed a price increase for the Wyoming landmark and 16 other national parks. Trump also faced criticism — and legal action — for his decision to shrink federally protected land by about two million acres in Bear Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah earlier this month. In April, Trump signed an executive order to review more than a dozen national monuments across the USA. Washington, D.C.: Nation's capital becomes epicenter of the #resistance Home to the most massive manifestations of opposition to the Trump agenda in a year that saw #resistance protests and marches against the administration across the country, Washington, D.C., became a hotbed for public demonstrations countering the president. The Women's March on Washington was the first and fiercest, coming the day after Trump's inauguration (which did NOT draw the biggest crowd to the National Mall in history, despite some claims to the contrary) and drawing an estimated 500,000 people angered at a president accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct. Huge crowds also gathered for the March for Science, the People's Climate March and the March for Truth. Forgot about September's pro-Trump, Mother of All Rallies? It's understandable. Only a thousand folks turned out and it was held the same day as the historic Juggalo March. Puerto Rico: Maria devastates Puerto Rico, fueling feud with Trump Hurricane Maria pounded Puerto Rico in late September, causing unprecedented devastation to the island of 3.4 million people. The storm knocked out the majority of Puerto Rico's power and sparked a feud between the island and President Trump. For those unclear, Puerto Rico is indeed part of the United States — it's a commonwealth — and yes, its residents are U.S. citizens. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz took shots at Trump for the government's response to Maria, which she called ""inadequate."" Trump publicly bashed Cruz, saying she had ""poor leadership ability."" Months after the storm, large parts of the island remained without power, prompting Washington to seek efforts to modernize Puerto Rico's power grid. Guam: Priest sex abuse cases shatter faith on Guam The predominantly Catholic island of Guam was rocked when a Pacific Daily News investigation unearthed decades of sexual assault, manipulation and intimidation against children reared on the remote U.S. territory by some of its most revered men, the Catholic clergy. At least 143 cases of child sexual abuse have been reported against Catholic priests tied to Guam. Of those cases, 87 involve a single former priest and scoutmaster, Louis Brouillard, who allegedly committed horrendous sexual crimes against children, including accounts of rape, drugging and even tying up a boy before forced sex acts. Also among the accusations: a boy fondled on the way to his grandmother's burial, and another molested for the first time on his seventh birthday, then raped or assaulted 100 more times. U.S. Virgin Islands: Ravaged by back-to-back hurricanes Before Hurricanes Irma and Maria made their way to Florida and Puerto Rico, they tore through the U.S. Virgin Islands, a cluster of American islands in the Caribbean. Weeks after the back-to-back September storms, Virgin Islanders – who are Americans by birth – were in the grips of a long and painful recovery. Thousands went without power, and telephone and internet coverage remained spotty. Many fled – perhaps never to return. When USA TODAY reporter Fredreka Schouten returned home, she found family and friends' houses torn apart, and her former school with windows blown out and metal littered about. The destruction brought back memories of past devastating storms – Hugo in 1989 and Marilyn in 1995. This is a compilation of stories from across USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network.

245,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/0_tVbCs4FQg/,"As though we do not already have enough proof that the American media is nothing less than a rolling clown car packed with deviants, sycophants, and propagandists, in His infinite wisdom and generosity, the Good Lord used all of last week to reveal once again just who these terrible people truly are. ABC Tanks the Stock Market with Fake News Are we at a point yet where “BrianRossing” is now a verb that describes a left-wing reporter (but I repeat myself) rushing before a network news camera to spread flat-out lies? Or maybe “BrianRossing” should be used to describe the consequences of that behavior — such as a month off to enjoy the holidays. Back in 2012, Ross, a marquee reporter for ABC, could not wait to falsely blame a Tea Partier for a horrific mass-shooting in a Colorado movie theater. Fast-forward to last Friday, and this very same Ross could not wait to tell the world that candidate Trump issued orders to get in touch with the Russians — which would prove Trump must be impeached for colluding with said Russians. The only problem is that none of that was true. Nevertheless, ABC News took all day, seven full hours, before issuing a “clarification.” Not a retraction or correction — a clarification. Did I mention that ABC’s fake news tanked the stock market? MSNBC’s Favorite Homophobe Between 2007-2009, in what is unquestionably the most blatant and inexcusable act of homophobia attached to any single person currently working in the legitimate media, NBC’s Joy Reid — who anchors a show at MSNBC but has appeared on NBC News programs like Meet the Press — authored somewhere around a dozen articles that committed two breathtaking sins… 1) Without any proof, she outed then-Republican Florida Governor Charlie Crist as gay. 2) The left-wing Reid ridiculed and demeaned Crist for being gay. Writing for her online Reid Report, and hurling nicknames like “Miss Charlie,” the NBC News star repeatedly and mercilessly attempted to denigrate Crist over his sexuality. She even questioned his marriage: “Now that he’s married to a girl,” Reid wrote, “Charlie Crist is being sought out for all KINDS of good stuff… [The GOP] are wooing Miss Charlie to run.” “I can just see poor Charlie on the honeymoon, ogling the male waiters and thinking to himself, ‘god, do I actually have to see her naked…?’,” she added. Naturally, after getting caught by the left-wing Mediaite, Reid apologized Monday, and because her politics are “correct,’ that apology will be good enough for a mainstream media that has no scruples, decency, or integrity. But in an effort to save Reid, a cherished member of the anti-Trump Resistance, no one wants to discuss the full context of her monstrous behavior. At the time, Reid’s homophobic attacks on Crist were all part of a concerted effort on the left to kill his presidential aspirations. After 2008, this smear campaign went nuclear to protect Barack Obama’s re-election chances. Because Crist was seen as a comer, an inevitable 2012 presidential candidate, and the popular governor of a crucial swing state, the left went so far as to produce and release a theatrical documentary as a means to (falsely) out him as gay. Moreover, Reid was not some young, immature blogger when she did this. Rather, she was a 40 year-old woman with more than ten years of journalism under her belt. Again, Crist, who is now a Democrat congressman, has been married twice, both times to women. There is absolutely no proof he is a homosexual. This was a straight-up smear campaign. Regardless, no one at NBC News will ever again have the moral authority to lecture anyone about anything, much less homophobia. The Failing New York Times and Very-Fake-News-CNN Openly Join The Resistance Speaking of coming out… Although the left-wing New York Times itself avoided paying any taxes in 2014 and has spent years railing against big corporations influencing our political system, last week this very same tax-dodging big corporation took full advantage (if only in spirit) of the Supreme Court’s Citizen United decision with an all-out partisan assault against the tax reform bill that ended up passing in the U.S. Senate. Going way above and beyond an editorial, the Times launched a full-fledged Resistance Campaign to kill the bill. On its print and web pages, and through social media, the Times went so far as to publish the phone numbers of senators and urged its readers to call and demand a “vote against the Senate tax bill because it would increase the deficit by more than $1.4 trillion.” Yes, after eight years of their Precious Barry doubling 230 years of national debt all on his own, suddenly the Times is worried about deficits. Over at CNN, national laughingstock and White House correspondent/preener Jim Acosta spoke at the Poynter Journalism Ethics Summit and proved that entire concept a joke by calling on his fellow preeners “to resist” Trump. “Acosta says reporters are not a part of the ‘resistance,’ but adds: ‘When journalists are attacked, journalists have to resist,'” Politico’s Cristiano Lima reported. NBC News’ (alleged) Pervert Sex toys and James Bond door-locks;  a woman bent over a chair and “harassed” until she passed out out — allegedly. This is the 20 year face of NBC’s Today Show, the 20 year face of NBC News, the man paid $25 million annually to be that face, the alleged serial predator given an office hidden away in some dark corner of 30 Rockefeller… The MSM’s Pervert-Enablers And with Matt Lauer we have been told — just as we were with NBC/ABC/Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin and the New York Times/Politico’s Glenn Thrush and CBS’s Charlie Rose and countless others — that everyone knew! about Lauer. Up and down the corporate ladder, everyone knew! According to a report last week, this includes current CNN chief Jeff Zucker, who, in various roles,  oversaw the Today Show for well over a decade. — So take a good look at your mainstream media, folks… And what you will see is nothing less than an institution little different from the mafia, one populated only by liars, propagandists, homophobic smear-merchants, activists, perverts, abusers, and their enablers.

        Claudia Koerner Last updated on December 4, 2017, at 7:32 p.m. ET Posted on December 4, 2017, at 6:55 p.m. ET A 69-year-old Florida man was arrested last week after allegedly planning to carry out a mass shooting at a Florida mosque, authorities announced Monday. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said his office received a tip in late October that Bernandino Bolatete had expressed ""strong anti-Islamic sentiment"" and planned a mass shooting at the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida. An undercover detective began speaking to Bolatete and other state and federal agencies began to take steps to prevent an attack. According to court records, the detective became friendly with Bolatete, a Philippine national who has a green card, at a local shooting range. Bolatete confessed his failing health — the result of being shot in the kidney by a police officer in the Philippines years ago. Bolatete claimed to have killed the officer who shot him, court records said, and he also described his own prowess with firearms. In one conversation, the detective and Bolatete drove past the mosque on their way to the firing range. Bolatete said he expected bad news about his remaining kidney at an upcoming doctor's appointment and would then go to the mosque to kill worshippers, according to a transcript of the conversation in court documents: ""I have to bring my ... my long guns there and uh, stay at that, uh, tower. Keep shooting those Muslims, you know, on Friday. (laughing)"" Bolatete revealed he had considered how to access the minaret at the Islamic center, the documents said. And he told the detective he had five rifles. ""So we'll try ... we will try a Christian doing uh, terroristic [sic] act this time, hum, to the Muslims the, they [laughing] they doing it all the time. You know?"" he said, according to the court records. On a Facebook page that appeared to belong to Bolatete, he described himself as a shooting sport enthusiast and posted multiple photos of himself at a gun range. At least one post contained anti-Muslim propaganda — a fake news story headlined ""EVIL: Radical Muslims Rape, Make Woman Quote Quran, But How They 'Finish Her Off' Is the Worst."" In another conversation, the detective told a story about a Muslim man who hadn't paid him for work on the man's home. Bolatete offered advice to the detective on how to kill the man and get away with it, according to the court documents. On Nov. 24, the detective mentioned a friend was selling a firearm silencer. Three days later, Bolatete asked the detective if the silencer was still for sale because he ""might need it,"" court records said. Bolatete said he did not want to fill out paperwork to register the silencer because it would give authorities the right to search him, court records said. Bolatete was charged Friday on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm silencer, a federal offense. The purchase of the silencer was captured on an audio recording, according to court records. A Jacksonville Sheriff's Office SWAT team recovered it from Bolatete as they searched the room he was renting in a local home. The FBI then informed leaders at the Islamic center about the alleged plans as well as Bolatete's arrest. At no time during the investigation was anyone at the mosque at risk, FBI Special Agent in Charge Charles Spencer said Monday. If convicted, Bolatete would face up to 10 years in prison, and he could still be charged with other offenses related to his alleged plans. A civil rights investigation is ongoing, Spencer added. ""[The FBI's mission] includes enforcing civil rights statutes and protecting the public’s right to exercise freedom of religion as guaranteed by the First Amendment,"" he said. ""A civil rights investigation is ongoing. The FBI will not stand for threats of violence in our community against any group, and we will protect the freedoms the Constitution provides."" The local chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations praised the arrest of Bolatete, saying the attack he allegedly hoped to commit was an act of terrorism. ""This should concern not only Muslims, but all Florida residents regardless of faith,"" CAIR-Florida communications director Wilfredo Ruiz said in a statement. ""CAIR-Florida continues to work closely with our community to keep them safe by providing security training sessions in mosques and other locations throughout the state.""

248,https://hotair.com/archives/2017/12/11/atf-bump-stocks-second-thought/,"More than two months after their use in the worst mass shooting sprees in US history, Congress still has not acted on “bump stocks” — and now they may not need to act at all. The ATF, which originally allowed their sale, has notified Congress that they will review that decision. If they reclassify bump stocks as a full-auto modification, they can effectively ban them through the regulatory process, letting lawmakers off the hook for a statutory response: JUST IN: The ATF has sent letters to Congress formally notifying them they are reviewing whether “bump stocks” fall under the regulatory category of “machine gun,” which would allow them to be regulated by the bureau. — NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) December 11, 2017  Jeff Sessions gets results. Just a few days ago, the Attorney General announced that the Department of Justice would begin a review to determine whether bump stocks were already illegal: The Justice Department is reviewing whether devices that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire faster should be banned. The review announced Tuesday comes after a Las Vegas gunman used the so-called “bump stock” devices during a deadly October rampage that killed 59 people and wounded hundreds more. A bid to ban the accessory fizzled in Congress, even as bipartisan lawmakers expressed openness to the idea. The Justice Department will consider whether weapons using bump stocks should be considered illegal machine guns under federal law. They are currently legal and widely available. The ATF is a subsidiary agency of the DoJ, of course, and its quick response demonstrates the touchiness of this political issue. Republicans faced pressure to pass a statutory ban on bump stocks, a proposal that the NRA at first supported. After Nancy Pelosi cheered the measure as the catalyst for a “slippery slope” to gun control, that bipartisanship evaporated, and the eventual language in the proposal drew even more criticism. As a result, the effort to ban the modification has stalled. If the ATF reclassifies bump stocks and then bars their use, that will let Congress off the hook, at least for the moment. The bureau came under sharp criticism in October over their initial decision to allow the sale, with critics and firearms enthusiasts alike wondering what purpose the ATF thought they served in the first place. Republicans on Capitol Hill began wondering why they needed to intervene when the ATF could rectify the situation for themselves. Sessions appears to have taken the hint, albeit belatedly. Speaking of which … isn’t it curious how quickly the Las Vegas massacre dropped off the political radar screen? There have been media follow-ups with the victims, and lawsuits too — some of them running into eight figures: The husband and three children of a victim in the October’s Las Vegas concert massacre are seeking $45 million in damages from the estate of the gunman, PEOPLE confirms. On Wednesday, the family of 31-year-old Keri Galvan — who was killed along with 57 other innocent people in the mass shooting on Oct. 1 — filed a creditor’s claim against the estate of shooter Stephen Paddock in Clark County, Nevada, according to court documents first obtained by The Blast. … Documents filed in court and reviewed by PEOPLE show that Keri’s husband, Justin, and the couple’s three children, who are 10, 4 and 2 years old, are each seeking $10 million from Paddock’s estate. When Paddock’s motives could not be easily determined, the story faded very quickly from the front pages and top spots of media outlets. Some of that might be just the rush of other political stories, but it may also be that all we will ever have are frustrating conclusions to Paddock’s brutality. We will never know the motive, or at the very least, what we will ever know will never add up. We will have discovered no easy way to prevent this kind of attack in the future. No policy changes would have impacted it — not even the bump stock modifiers, which clearly made it worse but wouldn’t have prevented the attack from happening at all. Politically, the ATF move will take this even further off the front pages, but don’t expect that to remain the case. Gun-control advocates will take up this case again in the fall of 2018, and the lack of action in Congress will be cast as an indictment on Republican leadership rather than a recognition that little could have been done to stop Paddock in the first place.

249,https://hotair.com/archives/2017/12/13/win-lose-one-wh-bails-judicial-nominee-no-experience/,"If there is one area on which Republicans across the spectrum agree on Donald Trump’s performance, it’s the judiciary. After a slow start, the White House has aggressively filled openings on the district and appellate court levels. In fact, as Roll Call pointed out yesterday, Trump will likely set a new record for appellate confirmations in the first year of a presidency — helped in no small measure by Harry Reid’s deployment in 2013 of the “nuclear” option that eliminated the filibuster on presidential appointments: Senate Republicans are set to confirm three more of President Donald Trump’s appeals court picks this week, a push that will help set a record for the most such appointments in a president’s first year in office. The Senate is expected to confirm Steve Grasz for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, and James Ho and Don Willett for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, over the objections of Democrats who question whether they can be unbiased. That would mean at least a dozen Trump appointees would join the nation’s appeals courts — which have the last word in all but the 100 or so cases that the Supreme Court decides each year — in his first year in the White House. That comes in a year the Senate also confirmed Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch in April. It’s quite the success story, one which Republicans disaffected from Trump use to remind themselves that the alternative would have been worse. That doesn’t mean that a few road bumps might not materialize, however. One controversial nominee that had made it past his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing won’t get a confirmation vote, NPR reports: The nomination of Brett Talley, the Justice Department official in line for a lifetime judicial appointment, “will not be moving forward,” a Trump administration official told NPR Wednesday. Talley had been rated “unanimously unqualified” for the post by the American Bar Association this year after an evaluation that questioned his experience. Talley had never argued a case, or even a motion, in federal court, he testified. Even after Talley’s nomination advanced through the Senate Judiciary Committee on an 11-to-9 party-line vote, media reports and good government groups cast doubt on his credentials for the spot on the U.S. District Court in Alabama, along with raising questions about his alleged failures to disclose blog posts and his wife’s work in the Trump White House. Judiciary chair Chuck Grassley fired off a warning shot yesterday on both Talley and Jeff Mateer, both of whom got “unqualified” ratings from the American Bar Association. Grassley had pushed Talley forward anyway, but apparently got blindsided by Talley’s failure to disclose his political activity in comboxes and various blogs, as well as the familial connection to the White House. Buzzfeed reported last night that Talley offered to withdraw his name from consideration: One of President Donald Trump’s controversial judicial nominees, Brett Talley, has offered to withdraw his nomination, a source close to the situation told BuzzFeed News. … BuzzFeed News first reported on thousands of posts that Talley appeared to have written for a University of Alabama sports fan website, including on gun control, immigration, and other political subjects. In one post on TideFans.com, poster “BamainBoston,” who identified himself as Talley in 2014, wrote in response to the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, “My solution would be to stop being a society of pansies and man up.” Slate highlighted another post by BamainBoston that appeared to defend the early iteration of the Ku Klux Klan. Yeah … that’s not a good look for the White House or for Grassley. Small wonder Grassley’s sore about this. Later in the day, Mateer also got yanked: White House officials say the nomination of Brett Talley has been withdrawn. And a person familiar with the process says the administration hasn’t submitted paperwork for the nomination of Jeff Mateer and does not intend to. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said the two nominees were going nowhere. Mateer also failed to disclose some of his political activities, including one speech in which he said that transgender children are part of “Satan’s plan.” Mateer had not come up for committee review yet, and Grassley made it pretty clear that the nomination would not survive that process. This points to an issue seen repeatedly in this administration — a lack of thorough vetting for appointments. It’s good to set records, but federal bench appointments last a lifetime. They need a little more scrutiny, especially when appointing people who have never served on a bench or litigated a case in court. That’s not to say that such nominees might not turn into valuable jurists, but for those nominees, surprises are not going to be pleasant. Ever. Grassley is sending a message that if they don’t improve that vetting process, he will … and they’re not going to like the surprises that occur any more if that happens, either. Nevertheless, this is still shaping up as a good week for Trump on the courts. Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett should get confirmed shortly, and after that James Ho, to the appellate bench. Other than a couple of hiccups on Talley and Mateer, this aspect of the Trump administration has been a huge success. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

          / AP COLUMBIA, S.C. - Citing the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas, South Carolina's capital city approved a ban on ""bump stock"" devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to mimic fully automatic guns. The measure was approved by Columbia City Council on Tuesday night. Mayor Steve Benjamin has said he thinks the city of 134,000 people is the first to ban bump stocks. ""I believe in responsible gun ownership, and I believe in common sense,"" Benjamin said in a statement. ""That's why we've decided to do what our federal and statement governments are either unable or unwilling to do."" The ordinance makes it a misdemeanor to use bump stocks or a separate device called a ""trigger crank,"" both of which can be attached to guns to increase their rate of fire. A person could legally possess a bump stock if it's not connected to a gun and stored in a separate case. Officials with the National League of Cities were not aware of any other cities that have banned bump stocks. Spokesman Tom Martin noted in an email Monday that many cities are prevented from passing ordinances that go beyond state law. South Carolina does not regulate bump stocks. There are statewide bans on bump stocks in Massachusetts and California. The Columbia ordinance lays out an argument that it fits with a South Carolina law that prohibits local governments from regulating guns or their parts. The city's ban states that bump stocks and trigger cranks do not fall within the definition of a gun or component because a gun can operate when bump stocks are removed. The state's highest court has previously invalidated a local ordinance that went beyond state law. In 2010, the South Carolina Supreme Court struck down a Myrtle Beach ordinance that required that motorcycle riders wear helmets, with justices ruling the city could not require protective gear in the absence of a state law. Authorities say the gunman who opened fire on a Las Vegas music festival in October, killing dozens and wounding hundreds of people, had equipped a number of guns with bump stocks. The device, which fits over a semi-automatic rifle stock and grip, allows the weapon to fire at a rate similar to a fully automatic weapon. The Columbia ordinance references the Nevada shooting, saying: ""the carnage in Las Vegas was accomplished due to the rapid fire capabilities of a 'bump stock' attached to the shooter's firearms.""

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Amb. John Bolton gives his take on 'Happening Now.' Democrats are trying to stack the deck with female candidates for the 2020 presidential race, desperate for a do-over of Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 attempt to put a woman in the Oval Office for the first time. But if President Trump continues to have the kind of success for the American people in the next three years that he’s had in his first year in office, it’s doubtful that 2020 will see the first female president. In fact, it’s becoming more plausible that when our country does elect its first female president, that woman may very well be Republican Nikki Haley. As U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Haley’s handling of recent events set her apart as a rising star. Her performance has shown that she has what it takes on the international stage to represent America abroad. Like the president, she refuses to let the U.S. to be bullied by other countries. This week Haley announced a $285 million cut in the 2018-2019 U.N. operating budget. This comes after President Trump threatened to cut off U.S. funding to countries that voted in favor of a U.N. resolution that called on the U.S. to drop plans to move our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and condemned the U.S. for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The final vote was 128-9 in favor of the resolution. Another 35 nations abstained on the vote and 21 nations didn’t vote. Women had a pretty good year in 2017, but since President Trump is the president, our friends on the left would have their membership in the angry feminist club revoked if they ever admitted this truth. Haley said: “We will no longer let the generosity of the American people be taken advantage of or remain unchecked.” Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz praised the budget cut saying: “It’s about time we sent a message to the U.N., which has become a place of hate when it comes to the U.S. and Israel.” Haley was a successful two-term governor of South Carolina. She especially won praise for bridging the racial divide in the aftermath of the mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, when nine black church members were gunned down by an avowed white supremacist. Last month Politico ran an article headlined “Why 2020 Will be the Year of the Woman,” noting:  “In 2016, women composed nearly 60 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate, many of whom are understandably pining for the karmic justice of defeating Trump with shards from a glass ceiling that Hillary Clinton could not break.” Given Nikki Haley’s scorching speech at the U.N. last week standing up to Israel’s opponents and standing out as one of the more effective leaders in the Trump administration, a strong case can be made that 2017 is the real “Year of the Woman.” This year also saw the fear lifting for women to speak out when they’ve been victims of sexual misconduct, because now men in power are being held accountable for their behavior. Women had a pretty good year in 2017, but since President Trump is the president, our friends on the left would have their membership in the angry feminist club revoked if they ever admitted this truth. That aside, let’s not forget that 42 percent of women had no interest in voting to break the glass ceiling for Hillary Clinton in 2016. And we’re fooling ourselves if we think they’re going to vote to break it in 2020 just because another liberal woman shows up on the ballot. Nevertheless, the liberal feminists are persisting. Democratic Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of NewYork, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are all being talked about as possible 2020 Democratic presidential contenders. There’s also been speculation about Oprah Winfrey and Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg, though neither has shown any sign of planning to run. It seems as though the Democrats are just throwing whatever viable liberal female names they can out there, in hopes one of them will stick and that will be enough to make the glass come crashing down on Election Day. History has a way of repeating itself. It didn’t work in 2016 for Hillary and it won’t work in 2020. The first female president – the one who makes history and blasts through that glass ceiling – won’t be a token woman elected out of anger for past elections lost or past presidents despised. The first female president will be elected on her own merits – because of her accomplishments, her intelligence, her strength, her substance and her ability to lead our nation. She will stand out, not blend in. Nikki Haley has already set herself apart as one of the most effective leaders in this administration. She’s fearlessly stepped up, stood out and proven she's not afraid to make the tough calls. She does anything but blend in, which is why she is far more likely to see the Oval Office long before any of the liberal feminists taking a number and standing in line for 2020.

Ryland's grandmother Sandy Ward doesn't believe her grandson knows that his mother and two sisters were killed the massacre, but maintains that the little boy's spirits are up despite recovering from five gunshot wounds, including complications from a shattered femur. Ward spoke to KSAT-TV, where she detailed her struggles in the aftermath of the shooting, as well as her grandson's glee at receiving cards while hospitalized. ""It's really been hitting me this week,"" Ward said, talking about the loss of her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. ""It seems like all I do is cry lots of days because I still miss JoAnn and the girls (Emily and Brooke) and I'm sure it will be a long time before I get over that."" Ward added, ""They still haven't told [Ryland] yet that his mom and sisters are dead, but I'm ... sure he's kind of getting some kind of idea because he's 5."" ""Everybody else has been up there to see him, and they haven't been there,"" she explained. The mass shooting at First Baptist Church, by Devin Kelley, left 26 dead and injured 20 others. Ward noted that her grandson continues to smile despite the horror he's endured. ""You got so many nice people that are sending a card and a dollar to Ryland,"" Sandy said. ""He does really enjoy that a lot."" According to KSAT, doctors are hopeful that Ryland will go home in six to eight weeks.  KSAT reported that cards for Ryland can be sent to the following address:  P.O. Box 174 Sutherland Springs, Texas  78161 Sandy added that any money collected from cards will be put toward a Go-Kart.

254,http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/30/media-critics-say-buzzfeed-list-of-things-white-people-ruin-is-racist-bigoted/,"White people ruined America by voting for President Donald Trump, according to BuzzFeed writer Patrice Peck.  Peck kicks off her article, ""37 Things White People Need To Stop Ruining In 2018"" by saying: ""First of all, America."" Later in the article she links to a CNN graphic that indicates 58 percent of white voters voted for Trump. She goes on to use a series of random Twitter posts as further evidence of how white people have ruined things. For example, she suggests white people ruin the Grammy awards and the Oscars when they are given awards instead of nominees from other races. Additionally, white people have ruined  marijuana joints, the Hit Dem Folks Dance, the theme song from ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"" and “sneaker culture,” Peck says. ""One more time for ya'll in the cheap seats: THE.HIT.DEM.FOLKS.DANCE."" she wrote, linking to the following Twitter post:   According to Peck, white people also also to blame for destroying everything from makeup to macaroni and cheese and people's childhoods.  As evidence of  ""white people"" ruining childhoods, she links to a Twitter post of an elderly woman questioning a black youth selling candy in front of a store.  The article is not funny or edgy, media critics said. They pointed out that if a white person said similar things about any other race, it would ignite a firestorm. Conservative commentator Britt McHenry told Fox News,""This article isn’t funny, it’s racist—plain and simple. If a similar piece was written about any other ethnicity, the journalist would be fired on the spot. It undoubtedly would spark public outrage, and rightfully so.” Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor agreed, saying, ""The easy test of this is try imagining a bigoted piece of filth like this being written about any other group. Picture the ‘37 Things Black People Need To Stop Ruining In 2018’ headline and then wait for Twitter to shut down your account."" He added that “openly liberal media have finally outed themselves.” Left leaning media members believe racism and sexism is OK, along as white males with conservative values are the target. Gainor also alleged that Buzz Feed is “openly bigoted” but “major media will let them get it away it.” Outkick founder and media watchdog Clay Travis tweeted.“If this is written about any other race every advertiser bails on company & a ton of people are fired.” Tucker Carlson of Fox News weighs in on the BuzzFeed article in the following video.   Any time racist comments are publicly aired — even as satire — they have to potential to incite threats or violence. In October, for example, parents pulled students out of classes at Washington Township High School in Sewell, New Jersey on Thursday, over hallway scuffles caused by racial tensions. The problem was caused by ""a barrage of racist postings on social media by a member of the football team,"" according to WPVI-TV. George Ciccariello-Maher, a politics and global studies professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia, received death threats after writing racist social media posts. He tweeted, ""All I Want for Christmas is White Genocide,” then later called the post satire. In October, he tweeted that “Trumpism” and the “narrative of white victimization” caused the Las Vegas mass shooting that left 58 dead. Ciccariello-Maher is on administrative leave and is teaching classes remotely, according to reports.

Here’s a look back at our seven favorite moments The Daily Caller co-founder delivered in 2017.  In September, Carlson interviewed John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor Mike Isaacson over Antifa violence. The Daily Caller co-founder told him, “You’re conflating violence with ideas. If I have not raised my hand to strike you, you have no right to strike me.” Isaacson also found himself in hot water after it was discovered he sent a tweet calling his students “future dead cops.” In June, Carlson interviewed Lisa Durden over a black-only Memorial Day party.  Durden used the appearance to taunt, “Boo hoo hoo! You white people are angry because you couldn’t use your white privilege card to get invited to the Black Lives Matter’s all black memorial day celebration. Wow!” (RELATED: Black Lives Matter Throws ‘Exclusively Black’ Memorial Day Weekend Party) A feminist guest on Tucker Carlson Tonight in November openly said that women are better than men.  Cathy Areu said, “Women are better, unfortunately. We are not the murderers of our society. We are not committing the crimes. We commit less than 20 percent of the crimes. So actually, men are not as good as women. We are actually better.” (RELATED: Tucker Takes On INSANE Guest: ‘Women Are Better, Unfortunately’ [VIDEO]) Tucker asked her, “So if there’s toxic masculinity, that suggests the polar, right, toxic femininity. What would that look like? How prevalent is that?” Areu replied, “Well, sugar, spice and everything nice, that’s what it’s like to be a girl. But boys will be boys, and that’s what we’re raising. We’re raising boys to think they should be more powerful and stronger… maybe we’re just not raising them right. Why are women supposed to be nonviolent?” She was the same guest who said that Nancy Pelosi represents all women. (RELATED: Tucker Bursts Into Laughter At Journo Who Thinks Nancy Pelosi Represents ALL WOMEN [VIDEO])  Tucker reported in November that CNN had directed reporters to discredit Donna Brazile after she came out with revelations that hurt the image of Hillary Clinton.  The Daily Caller co-founder said, “According to highly informed sources we spoke to–highly informed–top management at CNN directed its employees to undermine Brazile’s credibility. Anchors and producers were vocally offended by her attacks on their friends, the Clintons. If you’ve been watching that channel, you may have noticed CNN’s anchors suggesting that Donna Brazile cannot be trusted, precisely because she took part in efforts to break the primaries for Clinton.” (RELATED: Tucker vs. Zucker: Tucker Says CNN Head Was ‘Fuming’ And ‘ENRAGED’ Over Donna Brazile [VIDEO]) Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman appeared on Tucker’s show in October, and decided not to leave after his segment ended.  Tucker decided to let him read the script for the next segment, which he did. Poorly.  Tucker revealed a bombshell in October — that the Podesta group was in Robert Mueller’s “crosshairs” over alleged Russian influence.  He said, “Our source says investigators are very interested in Manafort’s behavior while he ran the Trump campaign, but otherwise that description is mostly bogus. The investigation has broadened to determine which people and organizations in Washington have spent years working secretly as de facto operatives on behalf of the Russia government. The Podesta Group is chief among these de facto foreign operatives. ‘They’re are more focused on facilitators of Russian influence in this country, not election collusion,’ our source said. The Podesta Group is ‘in their crosshairs.'” (RELATED: Tucker BOMBSHELL: Podesta Group Is In Mueller’s ‘Crosshairs’ Over Russian Influence) Tucker dropped another bombshell in October when he revealed that Jesus Campos, a security guard at Las Vegas’ Mandalay Bay hotel, left the United States just a week after witnessing the Las Vegas shooting committed by Stephen Paddock.  Carlson said, “Our source told us that Campos entered the United States at the same crossing in January of this year. At that time, he was driving his own vehicle, with Nevada plates. And yet in this document from a little over two weeks ago, Campos was driving what appears to be a rental car with California plates.” He continued, “Jesus Campos is the only eyewitness to the biggest mass shooting in modern American history. At the time he was in Mexico, the press was reporting that investigators thought Paddock may have had an accomplice. Why did authorities allow him to leave the country just days after it occurred, while the investigation was still chaotic?” What was your favorite moment from this year?

257,https://www.theroot.com/cop-suffering-from-ptsd-after-pulse-massacre-will-lose-1821125841,"With only six months to go before he’s eligible for a full pension, Cpl. Omar Delgado, one of the first police to respond to the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, is losing his job. Hailed as a hero in the wake of the June 2016 mass shooting for saving the life of shooting victim Angel Colon, Delgado has since suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. As the Orlando Sentinel reports, after the massacre that left 49 people dead, Delgado returned to patrol duty with the Eatonville, Fla., Police Department for a few months but had to stop. He told CNN that he has had trouble sleeping and suffered from nightmares, depression and anxiety. Delgado eventually took a desk job with the department, performing administrative duties for the past eight months. Then, this past Monday, the Eatonville PD told Delgado that his last day would be at the end of the month. Delgado is not sure exactly why he’s being let go, and city officials wouldn’t comment on the case, citing privacy policies. The officer says that a doctor had found him unfit to resume full duties because of his PTSD, which he believes was a factor in the city’s decision to fire him. But Delgado—a nine-and-a-half-year veteran of the department—is being forced out just six months before he can receive his full retirement pension and disability benefits. If he made the 10-year mark, the 45-year-old officer could receive 64 percent of his salary and benefits for life. The timing of Delgado’s firing, however, means that Delgado is entitled to disability or a retirement pension, but not both, according to WESH-TV. As it stands, Delgado will only receive 42 percent of his salary (his disability pension), which will kick in when he turns 55. Delgado said that the departmental policy was news to him. “I don’t need to be a police officer with my gun belt and so forth to do those little tasks,” Delgado said about his administrative work. “Could they have let me do that for six more months? That’s the debate.” As Time magazine notes, Delgado isn’t the first officer who responded to the Pulse-nightclub shooting to be fired following a PTSD diagnosis. The Orlando Police Department let go Officer Gerry Realin, 37, in July. However, Realin will receive 80 percent of his $70,000 salary each year for the rest of life. Compare that with Delgado, who stands to receive 42 percent of his $38,5000 salary annually. But Eatonville, the home of Zora Neale Hurston and the oldest incorporated African-American town in the country, is reportedly strapped for cash. The Eatonville Town Council, following a harsh backlash to news of Delgado’s firing (WESH-TV reports that city officials have received death threats), voted unanimously to give Delgado an additional $1,200. The city also said that it would continue to help the officer with PTSD counseling. A blog posted on Psychology Today says that out of roughly 900,000 sworn officers in the U.S., approximately 19 percent may have PTSD. Some research also suggests that another 34 percent of law enforcement officers may suffer from symptoms of PTSD but “do not meet the standards for the full diagnosis.” (Note: This blog also tells us to take time to “smile at a cop,” since their jobs are so stressful, which is cute but also horseshit. Cops suffering from PTSD need real institutional support, and it’s unclear whether Delgado really received it.) Currently, PTSD is not covered by workers’ compensation in Florida. As the Orlando Sentinel notes, a proposed bill requiring first responders with PTSD to receive coverage for mental health treatment in their workers’ compensation packages advanced this week in the Florida Senate. Angel Colon, the man whose life Delgado saved last year, told Fox 35 that the Eatonville Police Department should support the veteran officer. “It’s a horrible feeling because this man, Omar, has been there for me ever since June 12,” Colon said, according to the Sentinel. “He’s the person who saved my life.” This is the type of officers we need. One who responds to a call for help, executes help, takes responsibility for his emotional well-being and by extension, the safety of his community by going on desk duty, and gets canned for it?",2017-12-08 13:15:00,Cop Suffering From PTSD After Pulse Massacre Will Lose His Job,,368082,http://theroot.com/

He promised that the many women who accused him of sexual misconduct ""will be sued after the election is over."" You bought it. He hasn't sued them, presumably because he doesn't want the truth to come out. 15. He said he would not be a president who took vacations. ""I would not be a president that takes time off,"" he promised, and he called Barack Obama ""the vacationer-in-Chief."" You bought it. But since becoming President he has spent nearly 25 percent of his days at one of his golf properties for some portion of the day, according to Golf News Network, at a cost to taxpayers of over $77 million. That's already more taxpayer money on vacations than Obama cost in the first 3 years of his presidency. Not to mention all the money taxpayers are spending protecting his family, including his two sons who travel all over the world on Trump business. 16. He said he'd force companies to keep jobs in America, and that there would be ""consequences"" for companies that shipped jobs abroad. You believed him. But despite their promises, Carrier, Ford, GM, and the rest have continued to ship jobs to Mexico and China. Carrier (a division of United Technologies) has moved ahead with plans to send 1,000 jobs at its Indiana plant to Mexico. Notwithstanding, the federal government has rewarded United Technologies with 15 new contracts since Trump's inauguration. Last year, Microsoft opened a new factory in Wilsonville, Oregon, that was supposed to herald a new era in domestic tech manufacturing. But in July, the company announced it was closing the plant. More than 100 workers and contractors will lose their jobs when production shifts to China. GE is sending jobs to Canada. IBM is sending them to Costa Rica, Egypt, Argentina, and Brazil. There have been no ""consequences"" for sending all these jobs overseas. 17. He promised to revive the struggling coal industry and ""bring back thousands"" of lost mining jobs. You bought it. But coal jobs continue to disappear. Since Trump's victory, at least six plants that relied on coal have closed or announced they will close. Another 40 are projected to close during the president's four-year term. Utilities continue to switch to natural gas instead of coal. 18. He promised to protect steel workers. But according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, which tracks shipments, steel imports were 19.4 percent higher in the first 10 months of 2017 than in the same period last year. That import surge has hurt American steel workers, who were already struggling against a glut of cheap Chinese steel. For example, ArcelorMittal just announced it will soon lay off 150 of its 207 steel workers at its plant in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. 19. He said he'd make America safer. You believed him. But according to Mass Shooting Tracker, there have been 377 mass shootings so far this year, including 58 people killed and hundreds injured at a concert in Las Vegas, and 26 churchgoers killed and 20 injured at a church in Texas. Trump refuses to consider any gun controls. 20. He said he'd release his taxes. ""I'm under a routine audit and it'll be released, and as soon as the audit is finished it will be released,"" he promised during the campaign. He hasn't released his taxes.

259,https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/how-country-music-is-helping-las-vegas-heal-after-shooting-w514200,"Welcome, Dierks Bentley, Cole Swindell and other country stars perform during NFR week, the first large-scale run of country concerts since the October shooting Reporter Dierks Bentley was among the country artists who performed at NFR in Las Vegas this month, the first large-scale run of country concerts since the Route 91 shooting. C Flanigan/FilmMagic With tall casino buildings surrounding him, Matt Farmer stood near the sound booth watching country star Kip Moore perform a 90-minute set outdoors on Las Vegas’ famed Freemont Street. At one point, Farmer, a local entertainment manager, looked up at the hotels. “Is that a sniper up there?” he wondered, pointing to the top of a nearby casino. This curiosity wasn’t something that really ever crossed his mind before October 1st. Farmer was at the Route 91 Harvest festival that evening when a gunman opened fire on the crowd from a 32nd floor window at Mandalay Bay, killing 59 people and injuring more than 500 before taking his own life. Farmer helped a friend to safety after she’d been shot in the hand and buttocks. Related

						20 Greatest Best Song Oscar Performances Since that day, the city of Las Vegas has been struggling to heal from the worst mass shooting in United States history. The words “Vegas Strong” are seen all over town; there have been fundraisers featuring the city’s showroom headliners; Vegas bands like Imagine Dragons and the Killers held other benefits.  With the exception of a few shows, country music had been largely absent from the city in the wake of the shooting. However, the genre returned to Las Vegas in a big way during the 10-day National Finals Rodeo, the annual rodeo competition that brings both fans of the sport and country music to town. George Strait, Dierks Bentley, Cole Swindell, Dustin Lynch, Dwight Yoakam, Gary Allan, Alabama, Easton Corbin, Chris Janson and Carly Pearce were among the headliners this year. “We’re here for y’all,” Swindell, a staunch advocate for the U.S. military, told the crowd during his indoor concert at the Cosmopolitan. “No one knows more than Vegas that evil isn’t just overseas.” Swindell didn’t shy away from the tragedy, even visiting a local fire station full of first responders. At both of his concerts he also prefaced his performance of his hit ballad “You Should Be Here” with a tear-jerking video of Route 91 shooting victim Brennan Stewart singing the song. “This is what Vegas strong looks like,” Swindell said near show’s end. “I like it.” Midland’s Mark Wystrach embraced the city’s motto, too. “I know Vegas is Vegas Strong,” he said during a performance by the “Drinkin’ Problem” trio. “We’ve never stopped coming out here and playing this city. Some of the best fans in the world are in Las Vegas.” Dierks Bentley has a more personal connection to Las Vegas and the tragedy. He met his wife and got engaged in Las Vegas and has co-hosted the Academy of Country Music Awards, which take place in Vegas, for the past two years. He also played the first year of Route 91 in 2014. On Friday and Saturday, he performed at the Cosmopolitan’s Chelsea theater. “Every country singer has a special connection to this town,” he said while wearing bracelets with the words “Vegas Strong” and “Pray for Las Vegas.” “I think about what happened every single day.” In an impromptu moment, he changed up his set list to include the inspirational “Riser.” “This song is all about people that rise up, the people that run toward danger,” Bentley said onstage. “These are the kind of people I want to be like, that I aspire to be like, all the first responders … They are the risers amongst us, so we send this out to them.” This actually wasn’t Bentley’s first time to Vegas since the shooting. Just a week after the tragedy, he flew his own plane to Las Vegas to visit with victims and perform for first responders at University Medical Center.  “I’ve played Red Rocks [amphitheater] in Colorado, I’ve played football stadiums with Luke Bryan, I’ve had a chance to play the Grand Ole Opry, I’m a Grand Ole Opry member, but this show at UMC has had the biggest effect on me of any show I’ve played over the past 15 years,” he said on Saturday. “To look out over that crowd, this wasn’t victims, this was just the people that were involved trying to help people. A lot of tears, a lot of people who were happy to see me, a lot of people who were just too caught up in the grief. It’s affected me and it will forever.” Bentley added that it’s encouraging to see Las Vegas country fans smiling again. “When we played here last night … to see people have a great time, that’s why we do what we do,” he said on Saturday. “Some people have vices. In Vegas, people gamble, do drugs or do crazy shit, but country music fans love country music and this is how they cope with shit – they go to a concert.” It’s been more than two months since the Route 91 shooting and Las Vegas is still coping and processing, but with every new country concert, the city is also healing. And NFR was the welcome-back party it so desperately needed. Want more Rolling Stone? Sign up for our newsletter. Newsletter Signup Have a Tip?

260,https://www.opednews.com/articles/An-epidemic-of-mental-illn-by-Paul-Abramson-Health_Mental-Health-Privacy-171210-229.html,"We soon mark the anniversary of the shooting that wounded Rep. Giffords
(January 8th) and others that day. We'll sooner see the anniversary of Sandy Hook in
Newtown CT (December 14th), and too many others.
After recently being reacquainted with a friend from the '70s who shared a horrific
series of events that he endured as a child and a teen, it is painfully obvious that
we need to address our failing and deteriorating mental-health systems,
specifically research, to develop and use improved diagnostic tools to properly
diagnose mental illnesses. This friend's parents had their child institutionalized between ages five and
seventeen, at great cost, merely to be rid of him. In addition, the private
institutions happily kept him there without any medical basis or diagnosis while
receiving large sums of money.
The lack of substantive diagnostic tools to accurately diagnose mental illness and, at the time, the lack of regulation allowing two private mental-health institutions
(in MN and IL) to admit and detain him for years with no documented diagnosis
is inhumane and unthinkable.
There were also no advocating agencies supporting patient rights, in this case
the child, inappropriately institutionalized and labeled mentally ill, to ensure that
he was being treated appropriately and fairly. Misdiagnosis, or in this case, no
diagnosis results in ineffective or inappropriate treatment, which further worsens
the outcome.
Yes, we have gotten better at diagnosing Autism and Asperger's syndrome,
which is an improvement from the 1970s, when we were institutionalizing
sufferers and essentially mistreating or not treating them at all, but we are still
misdiagnosing bipolar and unipolar disorders. If we had diagnostic tools that
could actually verify a diagnosis, we would be able to treat more effectively and
begin to make progress with the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of mental
illnesses.
We have fewer available beds today in our hospitals and institutions for the
seriously mental ill and we are incarcerating many in our prisons. Fifty years
ago, we began the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill and we transferred
much of the fiscal responsibility to the federal government. During the last thirty
to forty years, we have seen it become a very costly failure, costly in lives and
dollars.
The CDC stated the following in September 2011, comparing illnesses: ""Mental
illnesses account for a larger proportion of disability in developed countries than
any other group of illnesses, including cancer and heart disease."" We have too many instances of mass killings, mass murders/suicides, individual
suicides, and a host of other violent acts that are perpetrated by people who
have gone undetected or undiagnosed.
When we look at the shooting that wounded Rep. Giffords, and others, the Sandy
Hook mass shooting, and too many others, and when these instances are
discussed and analyzed in our media, they are said to have been done generally
by young males who are not that severely ill. When further investigated, family,
friends, educators and others may have seen signs, but they went unmentioned
or not investigated. We also hear too often that they are over eighteen and that
families may not be able to do anything because they are of age and they have
not been a threat previously to themselves or others. Again, mental illness in this country seems to be misdiagnosed, undiagnosed
and/or untreated and when treatment is attempted, many times it is done with
over-prescribing medications that may be creating or exacerbating more
illnesses.
Something clearly needs to be done with what appears to be an epidemic of
mental-illness issues having profound affects on our communities and cities.
In regard to the horrific shootings in Sandy Hook, of Rep. Giffords, and the
others, it is not that they occurred, but that they were preventable, and we
continue to blindly turn our backs on a shattered mental-health system.  1

261,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/12/the-house-just-took-one-step-toward-allowing-americans-to-carry-concealed-guns-everywhere/,"RonBailey/iStock The semi-perennial attempt by House Republicans to allow anyone permitted to carry a concealed gun in one state to be able to do so in any other state—even if that state has much stricter standards for issuing concealed carry permits—took a frightening step forward Wednesday afternoon. HR 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, which the National Rifle Association (NRA) has called the group’s “highest legislative priority” in 2017, passed the House—taking the provision as close as its ever been to becoming reality. Introduced by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC) on the first day of the year’s legislative session, HR 38 lingered relatively untouched for most of the year until last week when there was a flurry of unexpected activity: GOP leaders, after conducting a whip count and sensing the measure would have enough support to pass a floor vote, passed it out of the House Judiciary Committee, while simultaneously rejecting amendments brought by Democrats, including banning violent offenders. Debate on the House floor lasted just an hour on the bill, and six Democrats joined a united Republican caucus in voting to pass it. The legislation can now be taken up for a vote in the Senate. Strategically, and despite the efforts of some on the left, Republicans had folded reciprocity into a broader guns package that also includes a bi-partisan measure called the Fix NICS Act—a provision aimed at improving the accuracy of background check data in order to prevent criminals and individuals with mental illness from being able to purchase guns. This notion gained particular urgency after the recent mass shooting in Texas, in which the gunman had been convicted of assaulting his wife and his infant stepson while in the Air Force, but the military never sent his criminal records to the background checks databases. The move put Democrats in a difficult position: In order to pass the Fix NICS Act—which has support from groups as varied as Everytown for Gun Safety and the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence to the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the NRA—they had no real choice but to pass the national reciprocity bill, which in various forms has been opposed by the party for years. Gun advocates typically claim that the need for reciprocity is a matter of convenience to travelers who must contend with a “patchwork” of gun laws while on interstate road trips, often decrying, as Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) did on Twitter after the House voted on Wednesday, “The Second Amendment doesn’t disappear when law-abiding citizens cross state lines. H.R. 38 guarantees that.” Opponents, meanwhile, argue that reciprocity effectively guts existing state laws. Some states have stringent safeguards in place for issuing conceal carry permits, like mandating training and thorough evaluations; other states do almost nothing to vet the people who would be carrying guns in public. In Utah, for instance, all someone has to do to get a concealed carry permit is take a gun safety class certified by the Utah Bureau of Criminal Identification. In Virginia, people get four attempts to answer 15 of 20 questions correctly after taking an online course to get a permit. Currently, 19 states don’t require any gun safety training in order to carry a concealed gun in public, and 12 states don’t require a permit or background check, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. HR 38 effectively neutralizes the playing field. What’s more, there is a loophole that would allow individuals who don’t qualify for a permit in their state of residence to be able to get one in a state with little to no restrictions. “Under Hudson’s bill, a California resident who cannot get a concealed-carry permit in California can easily get one from Utah, and then carry guns in California without ever setting foot in Utah, and not for some short duration like a tourist stay, but for the rest of his life and every day,” Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles, explained to me when the bill was introduced in January. “The real impact of the Hudson bill is not to protect interstate travelers; it’s to require states with restrictive concealed-carry policies to allow their own residents to carry guns.” A handful of previous efforts to pass national reciprocity have failed. And while HR 38 has now passed the House, a version of it will still have to contend with the Senate, which will need eight Democrats to support the measure for it to pass. While those prospects seem slim, if it were to pass the Senate, two things are certain: First, it’s all but guaranteed that President Trump will sign it into law. “Trump has been a strong supporter from the very beginning of the whole concept of concealed carry, even before he ran for president,” says Todd Rathner, a prominent gun rights lobbyists based in Arizona. “I don’t think he’d have any hesitations signing this.” The second is that lawsuits will be waiting. In a statement, Eric Tirschwell, director of litigation and national enforcement policy for Everytown for Gun Safety, said, “We fully expect that the Senate will hear the voices of law enforcement and the public, and stop this dangerous legislation from becoming law. But if it were to make it to the president’s desk, we’d be waiting on the other side fully prepared to challenge it in court.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Even if Trump decided he wanted to act, which he will not, his party would block him…. But Vegas makes it much harder for Republicans to roll back existing gun laws. In the wake of the attack, House Republican leaders have decided to table a bill that would loosen restrictions on purchasing gun silencers. At least for now. “That bill, introduced by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), has been approved by the Natural Resources Committee and was expected to be on the House floor soon, though it had not yet been scheduled for a vote,” Politico reports. “Consideration of the bill was (already) postponed earlier this year after Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) was shot in June at a congressional baseball practice.” Khaled Beydoun/WaPo: We have yet to determine whether [Las Vegas shooter Stephen] Paddock was motivated by anyone or anything, so many are tiptoeing around terms such as “terrorist.” But if Paddock were Muslim, his status as a local individual would be entirely irrelevant, and the motive of “Islamic terrorism” or “jihad” would likely be immediately assumed, even without any evidence. The Las Vegas shooting raises several questions linked to race and religion and how they figure into our imagining and policing of terrorism. President Trump has ushered in the third phase of the war on terror, and his brazen “clash of civilization” rhetoric around U.S. anti-terrorism policy and programming has fixated on Muslims. ProPublica: Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. Were Close to Being Charged With Felony Fraud New York prosecutors were preparing a case. Then the D.A. overruled his staff after a visit from a top donor: Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz. In one email, according to four people who have seen it, the Trumps discussed how to coordinate false information they had given to prospective buyers. In another, according to a person who read the emails, they worried that a reporter might be onto them. In yet another, Donald Jr. spoke reassuringly to a broker who was concerned about the false statements, saying that nobody would ever find out, because only people on the email chain or in the Trump Organization knew about the deception, according to a person who saw the email. There was “no doubt” that the Trump children “approved, knew of, agreed to, and intentionally inflated the numbers to make more sales,” one person who saw the emails told us. “They knew it was wrong.” Reed Galen/RCP: These are questions we rarely ever had to ask ourselves. We never would’ve thought about them. But too many mass shootings later, there is no segment of society, no demographic, no geography, no political bent that is safe from the AR-15 or the AK-47 on American soil. That is a disgrace. What’s worse than that? So many of us are so desensitized to these horrors that we’re beginning to believe that this is now just part of life. Don’t. Don’t allow yourself to fall into that trap. We cannot and we must not forget the shattered latticework of lives affected by these events. Change can only begin and end with us. It won’t be delivered to our doorstep by Amazon. If chaos truly presents opportunities, let’s take this one and make something of it. We owe it to all those kids, office workers and concert-goers who will never have the chance.  President Trump: ""Now I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack"" https://t.co/3DSMX2ysAx  David Frum/Atlantic: Trump’s speech to the nation after the Las Vegas atrocity, however, was steeped in hypocrisy. He is the least outwardly religious president of modern times, the president least steeped in scripture. For him to offer the consolations of God and faith after mass bloodletting is to invite derision. “It is love that defines us,” said President Trump, and if we weren’t heartbroken, we would laugh. Those who praised the speech, as CNN’s John King did, are reacting on reflex. This is the kind of thing we are used to hearing from Republican politicians; Trump is a Republican politician; therefore this is what he should say. But whereas Vice President Pence could have pronounced those words with sincerity, or a convincing simulacrum thereof, Donald Trump looked shifty, nervous, and false. Speeches are watched as well as heard, and the viewer saw a president who wished he were somewhere else because he had been compelled to pretend something so radically false to his own nature.  I see your well-reasoned arguments. However, you've elected ppl who are handsomely paid & richly rewarded to refuse to see reason.  Aaron Blake/WaPo: Terrorism or not? Las Vegas reignites a real — and really important — debate.  This may seem like a semantic debate. Lots of people are dead and wounded, and a word isn't going to change that. But that word does have all kinds of implications for how these episodes are treated both by the federal government and in our national discourse. It's important. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) noted the implications of the debate.  Now we're obsessing over whether the NV carnage was ""terrorism"". If we decide it is, we'll mobilize untold resources. If not, nothing.   As for the technical definition of terrorism, it importantly deals with the motive rather than the size of the carnage. Federal law says terrorism is “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.” In other words, whether 50 people are killed or a few people are hurt, what matters is what the attacker intended.  @JeremyKonyndyk Jeremy Konyndyk with further observations on Trump's response to Puerto Rico https://t.co/Q29hbXgwNt  Greg Sargent/WaPo: Jimmy Kimmel’s monologue on guns was very powerful. It’s not enough, Jimmy. No question, Kimmel said many of the things that needed to be said. He demolished the dumb talking point that now is not the time to debate solutions: “We have 59 innocent people dead, it wasn’t their time, either.” He excoriated the fact that gun violence has now become accepted as routine. He rightly contrasted inaction on guns with our willingness to use government to combat other public safety threats. He even named names, tearing into Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan for offering empty “thoughts and prayers” while doing nothing, because “the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” But Kimmel nowhere fingered the Republican Party as the obstacle to action on this issue, instead aiming the blame at “congresspeople.” If you are Jimmy Kimmel, and you want more regulation of guns, the Republican Party is your problem. The Democratic Party has long supported and pushed for the very same solutions Kimmel called for last night. The GOP has blocked them. James Fagone/HuffPost: WHAT BULLETS DO TO BODIES The gun debate would change in an instant if Americans witnessed the horrors that trauma surgeons confront every day. [Trauma surgeon Amy] Goldberg jumped in. “As a country,” Goldberg said, “we lost our teachable moment.” She started talking about the 2012 murder of 20 schoolchildren and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Goldberg said that if people had been shown the autopsy photos of the kids, the gun debate would have been transformed. “The fact that not a single one of those kids was able to be transported to a hospital, tells me that they were not just dead, but really really really really dead. Ten-year-old kids, riddled with bullets, dead as doornails.” Her voice rose. She said people have to confront the physical reality of gun violence without the polite filters. “The country won’t be ready for it, but that’s what needs to happen. That’s the only chance at all for this to ever be reversed.” It is so hard to ask families and relatives to release these pictures. Don’t say: “if they would just...” If you haven’t been there, you don’t know what you are asking. Not everyone has the strength and resolve of Emmett Till’s mother. White House says now not the time for gun debate https://t.co/ClB9cVo64F pic.twitter.com/iKc7emAEl2  Ã¢ÂÂThe time is always right to do what is right.Ã¢ÂÂ Martin Luther King, Jr. https://t.co/lWo5zFbEPx  Monkey Cage Blog/WaPo: In our research, we discovered that people who live close to a mass shooting are more likely to support gun control than those who don’t. Alice Dreger/Chronicles of Higher Education, in a piece I find hard to characterize, about academic freedom. BTW, sexual discussions with Alice are not only not rare, they are what she does. The blowjob reference is not gratuitous: Take Back the Ivory Tower Democracy depends on having a public capable of thinking Forgive me while I reminisce about the days when I worked at a place that protected a Holocaust denier on the faculty. This was in early 2006, when I was only about a year into my decade of being on the faculty at Northwestern University. An electrical-engineering professor named Arthur Butz had just made a statement denying the Holocaust. In response, our university president, Henry Bienen, issued a statement I saved like a prize: ""There is no question that the Holocaust is a well-documented historical fact,"" but ""we cannot take action based on the content of what Butz says regarding the Holocaust — however odious it may be — without undermining the vital principle of intellectual freedom that all academic institutions serve to protect."" In other words, the brilliance of the many depends fundamentally on the right of the one to be stupid. Reading Bienen’s statement, I knew Northwestern was a place where I could do what I needed to do as a scholar and teacher. We had the right to be wrong! And that was true. Until Northwestern’s administration changed, along with the rest of academia, and I learned the hard way that I had been branded. Trigger warning: Here comes the blowjob.  Ã¢ÂÂResist tribalism. Punish one another only for the mortal sin of making crap up.Ã¢ÂÂ --@AliceDreger to scholars.https://t.co/UaLu44d74c  For the record, the manuscript specified making shit up."" https://t.co/6XwhbheJIN  Dan Drezner/WaPo: Yesterday the Chicago Council on Global Affairs released its first in-depth poll about what Americans think about America first [Full disclosure: I am on the advisory board that oversees this survey.] My Post colleagues Dan Balz and Emily Guskin suggest that the reports are not good for the Republican Party: “The council’s survey finds that Trump’s most fervent supporters solidly support his views on these issues, but Republicans with less favorable impressions of the president are far less enthusiastic and are more closely aligned in their attitudes with the overall population. The survey also underscores the degree to which Trump, despite the bully pulpit of the White House, has been unable to shift public opinion in his direction on foreign policy issues. In fact, the opposite has occurred. Public attitudes have moved away from a number of the positions he espoused during his campaign and since.” Someday…. this might happen. It’s years and years away.

The tensions came to a head around the time President Donald Trump delivered a politicized speech in late July to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization Tillerson once led, the officials said. Just days earlier, Tillerson had openly disparaged the president, referring to him as a “moron,” after a July 20 meeting at the Pentagon with members of Trump’s national security team and Cabinet officials, according to three officials familiar with the incident.

Here's just a small sampling of what we suffered through in 2017. The new boss proved to be the same as the old boss. True to form, the new boss (Donald Trump) proved to be no better than his predecessors in the White House in terms of protecting the citizenry from the American police state. 911 calls turned deadly. ""Don't call the cops"" became yet another don't to the add the growing list of things that could get you or a loved one tasered, shot or killed by police, especially if you have any condition that might hinder your ability to understand, communicate or immediately comply with an order. Traffic stops took a turn for the worse. Police officers were given free range to pull anyone over for a variety of reasons and subject them to forced cavity searches, forced colonoscopies, forced blood draws, forced breath-alcohol tests, forced DNA extractions, forced eye scans, forced inclusion in biometric databases. The courts failed to uphold justice. A review of critical court rulings over the past decade or so, including some ominous ones by the U.S. Supreme Court, reveals a startling and steady trend towards pro-police state rulings by an institution concerned more with establishing order and protecting the ruling class and government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution. A culture of compliance paved the way for sexual predators. Twenty years after America gave a collective shrug over accusations of sexual harassment by Bill Clinton, sexual harassment suddenly made headlines after a series of powerful men, including Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, were accused of predatory behavior in the workplace. Patriotism trumped free speech. At a time when the American flag adorns everything from men's boxers and women's bikinis to beer koozies with little outcry from the American public, a conveniently timed public dispute over disrespect for the country's patriotic symbols during football games further divided the nation. Mass shootings claimed more lives. A mass shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest to date, left us with more questions than answers, none of them a flattering reflection of the nation's values, political priorities, or the manner in which the military-industrial complex continues to dominate, dictate and shape almost every aspect of our lives. Civil discourse was drowned out by intolerance, violence and militarized police. Americans allowed their fears--fear for their safety, fear of each other, fear of being labeled racist or hateful or prejudiced, etc.--to trump their freedom of speech and muzzle them far more effectively than any government edict could. In Charlottesville, Berkeley and St. Louis, the presence of violent protesters and militarized police turned First Amendment activities into riots. The cost of endless wars drove the nation deeper into debt. Waging endless wars abroad (in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and now Syria) didn't make America--or the rest of the world--any safer, any greater, or any richer. The interest alone on the money America has borrowed to wage its wars will cost an estimated $8 trillion. Government agencies padded their pockets at the expense of taxpayers. In Virginia, drivers traveling along a toll road during rush hour were hit with a $40 toll to travel a 10-mile stretch of road, part of a new dynamic price gouging scheme aimed at penalizing single-occupant vehicles traveling during peak times. The plight of the nation's homeless worsened. In communities across the country, legislators adopted a variety of methods (parking meters, zoning regulations, tickets, and even robots) to discourage the homeless from squatting, loitering and panhandling. Free speech was dealt one knock-out punch after another. First Amendment activities were pummeled, punched, kicked, choked, chained and generally gagged all across the country. The Surveillance State rendered Americans vulnerable to threats from government spies, police, hackers and power failures. The Corporate State tapped into our computer keyboards, cameras, cell phones and smart devices in order to better target us for advertising. Social media giants such as Facebook granted secret requests by the government and its agents for access to users' accounts. And our private data--methodically collected and stored with or without our say-so--was repeatedly compromised and breached.

265,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/APjYij3o_r0/how-jimmy-kimmel-made-late-night-matter-again-in-2017,"SEARCH Instead of screaming into the void of his own bubble, Kimmel surprised everyone by speaking his heart and effecting real change. Senior Writer There’s a reason why Jimmy Kimmel took the No. 1 spot in our list of the top 10 late-night moments of 2017. During President Donald Trump’s first year in office, the increasingly vast late-night landscape became a platform for the #Resistance to channel its outrage day after day. On any given night, Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee, John Oliver and others could be seen screaming some version of “this is not normal!” at their like-minded viewers. It was almost always cathartic, but almost certainly did not change any minds. Somehow, Jimmy Kimmel was different. When the host opened up about his baby son’s harrowing medical emergency in early May, his heartfelt words resonated with Americans on all sides of the Obamacare debate precisely because they weren’t used to hearing this type of political argument from him. Kimmel’s politics likely align with those of his more outspoken competitors, but he never made them a central part of his show, which has always been more concerned with celebrity and reality show culture than it has been with Washington and the White House. It only makes sense that his focus began to shift after the country elected a former reality star as president. When he hosted the Oscars in February, Kimmel spent a good deal of his monologue going after the “racist” president and his bizarre attacks on Hollywood stars like Meryl Streep. Over the next couple of months on his show, he roasted GOP figures like Paul Ryan and Sean Spicer. More recently he has found himself in full-on Twitter feuds with the likes of Donald Trump Jr. and Roy Moore. But no political commentary in Jimmy Kimmel Live!’s 15-year history came close to the widespread impact of his speech about the GOP’s plan to eliminate guaranteed health care coverage for those like his newborn son, who will forever have a “pre-existing condition.” “If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make,” Kimmel said on that first night, he voice trembling as he fought back tears. “I think that’s something that whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?” The answer from his audience and the majority of Americans was a resounding yes. “Watch & prepare to tear up. Thanks @jimmykimmel for sharing your story & reminding us what's at stake w/health care,” Hillary Clinton tweeted. “Well said, Jimmy. That's exactly why we fought so hard for the ACA, and why we need to protect it for kids like Billy. And congratulations!” former President Obama added. Of course, not everyone agreed with his premise. On the other end of the spectrum were tweets like the one from former GOP congressman and professional troll Joe Walsh, who wrote, “Sorry Jimmy Kimmel: your sad story doesn't obligate me or anybody else to pay for somebody else's health care.” Fox News, meanwhile, gave the trending topic cursory coverage without once mentioning the political message Kimmel was trying to impart. Five months later, Republicans still hadn’t managed to pass their promised Obamacare repeal and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) was still invoking the “Jimmy Kimmel test” to defend his new legislation with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). “Stop using my name,” Kimmel told Cassidy, whom he accused of lying to his face when he appeared on his show earlier in the year. In response, Cassidy went on cable news and condescended to the host, saying, “I’m sorry he does not understand.” Yet numerous fact-checking sites found faults in Cassidy’s claims while backing up most of what Kimmel said on the issue. Only later, through reporting by The Daily Beast’s Sam Stein, Asawin Suebsaeng and Lachlan Markay, did we learn that Kimmel got at least some of his talking points from the office of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who had been in touch with the host following his original monologue in May. Of course, all of this led to the dramatic Senate vote in late September when Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) gave the thumbs-down and effectively killed the GOP’s chances of ever repealing the Affordable Care Act — despite what you might have heard from President Trump this past week. “Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for being a hero again and again and now AGAIN,” Kimmel tweeted the morning after that vote. But while McCain may have cast the decisive vote, Kimmel deserves almost as much credit. He helped turn the tide on the public’s opinion, giving an adorable face to the value of Obamacare for so many less fortunate families across the country at a time when its repeal seemed all but inevitable with Republicans in control of the White House and both houses of Congress. What makes Kimmel’s victory all the more remarkable is how genuinely reluctant he seemed to be thrust into the position of “moral arbiter” for the American people, as one conservative critic put it, asking, “Who died and made him Jesus?"" After Kimmel delivered yet another emotional plea on his show in October, this time for action on gun violence following the mass shooting in Las Vegas, figures on the right started unearthing old comedy bits from his days on The Man Show, aiming to show him in a less heroic light. Co-opting the #MeToo moment, some even suggested he was guilty of the same type of behavior as the men who were being brought down for decades of sexual harassment. Kimmel was the first to acknowledge that he is far from perfect. “They’re saying that I’m calling myself the moral conscience of America, which I most certainly never did and most certainly never would,” he told Good Morning America in response to a question about his relative lack of material about Harvey Weinstein. He may well be proud of the work he did to preserve affordable health care for those like his son, but Kimmel quite clearly has no desire to become the next Jon Stewart. The irony is that as many of Stewart’s former colleagues vied for that position by railing against Trump every night in 2017, Kimmel managed to come the closest — not with outrage but with empathy.",2017-12-28 00:00:00,How Jimmy Kimmel Made Late-Night Matter Again in 2017,"politics and government,united states politics and government,medicine and health,television",1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
266,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/YpCaT4CdAbk/i-spent-90-days-with-a-baby-instead-of-donald-trump,"SEARCH During my maternity leave, I missed everything. And I missed nothing at all. Washington Bureau Chief The words in my reporter’s notebook from the day before my daughter was born say “neo-Nazis,” “many sides” and “repugnant.” That’s where the political world froze for me on August 14th at around 1 p.m., when I went into what would be 21 hours of labor, followed by three month and a half months of maternal bliss. In those 90 or so days, I missed approximately 55,541 news cycles—and that’s just inside the White House. While I was trying to master baby origami (a.k.a. swaddling an infant in the dark on 30 minutes of sleep) and Googling things like “neck cheese,” Steve Bannon left the West Wing, Seb Gorka soon followed, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price resigned. (Note to self: don’t let the government pay for those private jet trips again.) President Trump appeared to defend a group of neo-Nazis and white supremacists protesting in Charlottesville, Virginia, as “very fine people” and then disavowed them and then didn’t again; got in Twitter spats with a congresswoman over a conversation with a gold star widow; threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea (I have to say, there’s something uniquely disturbing watching the president bait nuclear war whilst feeding a newborn); and ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, struck a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to save it, then killed the deal he had reportedly struck. Outside the White House, healthcare repeal/reform efforts died at least twice, a tax reform bill passed the House, more than a dozen members of Congress announced they were retiring or otherwise moving on with their lives, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Ed Gillespie to become the next governor of Virginia, Sen. Rand Paul’s neighbor attacked him over yard waste, maybe, Sen. Luther Strange lost his primary to former Judge Roy Moore. Speaking of Roy. He was accused of sexually molesting a 14-year-old girl when he was a 32-year-old district attorney. Then Al Franken admitted and apologized for groping a radio host during a USO tour, and Rep. John Conyers was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment, paid settlement claims but has denied wrongdoing. It’s all part of the chain reaction in the halls of power—from Washington to New York to L.A.—set off by the women who stepped forward to accuse Harvey Weinstein of everything from sexual harassment to rape. Hillary Clinton released a book blaming the election outcome on the Russians, Donna Brazile released a book blaming the election results on Hillary Clinton (full disclosure: I have not read either yet, because of the aforementioned infant). Natural disasters wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and Houston, Texas. The response in Texas was swift, the response in Puerto Rico remains less so. Man-made disasters also took a toll. In my 90 days of maternity leave, there were more than 90 mass shootings—defined as the wounding or killing of four or more people in one incident—not including the shooter, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. That included the largest such shooting in American history in Las Vegas and one inside a Texas church. They were each followed by wrenching stories about the victims. Politicians offered thoughts, prayers, and very little action. Special Counsel Bob Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election rolled on. Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, was charged with money laundering and tax fraud, the world learned the name George Papadopoulos—a former member of Trump’s campaign foreign policy team—who plead guilty to lying to the FBI. (Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn plead guilty to lying to the FBI on my first day back.) Also on the Russian front, (thanks to reporting from The Daily Beast) we learned just how far Russian trolls went on social media to fuel American political divisions. So that guy Charlie from St. Pete, Florida, in your feed that was posting all these crazy anti-BLM memes? He was actually Sergey from St. Petersburg, Russia. In response (not really) Twitter doubled the number of characters you can use. Something no one asked for ever. Speaking of Twitter, the president tweeted about hate groups, his rally in Phoenix, ending the filibuster, the debt ceiling, James Clapper, Fake News, McConnell not doing his job, veterans, Chief of Staff John Kelly, Sen. Bob Corker, Corkers resignation, David Clarke’s new book, the Wall, NAFTA, Mexico, a Mother Teresa quote (on Aug. 27… I know, that one threw me too), a tax reform speech in Missouri, James Comey, Hillary Clinton (of course), Hillary Clinton’s new book, North Korea, DACA, Congress’ role in implementing DACA, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the response to both hurricanes, the criticism of the response to Hurricane Irma, ESPN, chain migration, the kid who mowed the White House lawn, supporting Sen. Luther Strange, blaming Strange for losing, his speech at the United Nations, the earthquake in Mexico, the Emmys, the greatness of Fox & Friends, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy’s healthcare bill, Rand Paul, standing for the national anthem, the NFL, Roger Goodell, John McCain, Nikki Haley, Jerry Jones, Roy Moore, his speech in Indiana about tax reform, welcoming Steve Scalise back to the House, adoration for Sean Hannity, Yom Kippur, FEMA, Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello, Rex Tillerson, “Rocket Man,” the mass shooting in Las Vegas, the stock market, Ralph Northam, Ed Gillespie, endorsing Gillespie, blaming Gillespie for losing, CNN, NBC News, Jemele Hill, his tax reform speech in Pennsylvania, National Farmer’s Day, Pakistan, Lou Dobbs, Chuck and Nancy, the Democrats, Tom Marino withdrawing from being the drug czar, CBS, ABC, Frederica Wilson, Niger, his call with the widow of a fallen soldier, wildfires in California, coal miners singing the national anthem, polls showing no one trusts the media, Lavar Ball... and so much more. In many ways I feel like I’ll never catch up and yet, at the same time, the political world is exactly how I left it. The tax reform bill is still moving through the legislative process, Obamacare—while weakened—is still the law of the land, and a government shutdown still looms. Democrats are still scrambling to get their party together after their staggering 2016 election loss, Republicans are still scrambling to get their party together after the staggering 2016 election win. President Trump remains himself. Case in point: as I started ramping back up for work this week, he made a joke about Pocahontas while honoring World War II Navajo code talkers... in front of a portrait of noted killer of Native Americans President Andrew Jackson. Also this week: Trump reportedly questioned whether the infamous Access Hollywood tape was real (it is, he apologized for it) and whether President Obama was born in the U.S. (he was, Trump admitted this last year).

As information was still coming in regarding Monday’s attempted terror attack in the New York City subway, an MSNBC panel discussing the news ridiculously shifted the topic to outrage over guns and gun crime in the U.S. And on top of that, they bemoaned how President Trump would try to make the attack an immigration issue to support his temporary travel ban. The person responsible for kicking off the gun discussion was former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton. After commenting on how few terror attacks have hit the U.S. since 9/11 (missing a few as he rattled them off), he opined: We will continue to prevent a lot of them. But the reality is they’re going to keep coming. And whether they’ve inspired, enabled or directed. But the sad reality in our country also is we’re sitting here talking right now, no loss of life here this morning, tremendous disruption. But someplace in America today, some nut with a gun is going to go out and kill three or four people. Every day we have a mass shooting in this country. “This is such a good point,” host Stephanie Ruhle praised. She was quickly cut off by anti-Trump Republican, MSNBC political analyst, and New York Times columnist Bret Stephens who was worried about the attack’s effect on immigration. “I suspect someone is, you can guess, is going to want to turn this into an immigration story. This is not a story about lax immigration rules,” he said. “Does that someone's name rhyme with shmump,” Ruhle childishly asked.    Stephens went on to complain that Trump’s view of terrorism was harming the way law enforcement thwarted terrorism because it damaged community relations. “That can't take place when you're demonizing entire categories of people or suggesting that because someone may have come as an immigrant that we should just bar the door to immigration from all Muslim countries,” he declared, falsely claiming the travel ban was applied to all or only Muslim counties. At one point, Ruhle couldn’t get her head around why Americans were afraid of terrorist attacks: Then why when you talk to people across America are they so concerned about national security? When you talk about all of the possible terror plots that have been thwarted, and the number really is low, it doesn't seem like America feels like the number's low. It seems like America thinks it's out of control. “Look, this is exactly it. And I think commissioner Bratton puts it exactly in perspective. We just had a mass shooting in Las Vegas in which 58 people were killed and we act as if -- it almost never happened,” Stephens responded, again bringing the discussion back to guns. “This has become a tool of political convenience. And people ought to stop and say just look how successful policing is, has been throughout the United States to stop terrorism.” “Let's look at these things in their right perspective. Because there's a serious loss of perspective at the country,” Stephens spat, before Ruhle cut away to introduce another guest. They want to talk about the “right perspective,” but clearly the only perspective they think is right is their anti-gun one, and they’ll use every opportunity to push it. They’re in the middle of reporting on an attempted bombing of a subway station and they want to focus on guns. Talk about a warped perspective. Transcript below:  MSNBC Live
		December 11, 2017
		9:11:13 AM Eastern BILL BRATTON: But in the whole country since 9/11, the number of deaths committed by terrorists has been a relatively small number. We've had Orlando. We had San Bernardino. We had the Boston marathon bombing. Then we certainly had our most recent event that took those lives down at the Hudson River but we have prevented a lot of them. We will continue to prevent a lot of them. But the reality is they're going to keep coming. And whether they've inspired, enabled or directed. But the sad reality in our country also is we're sitting here talking right now, no loss of life here this morning, tremendous disruption. But some place in America today, some nut with a gun is going to go out and kill three or four people. Every day we have a mass shooting in this country. So while we need to focus a lot of attention on terrorism because it attracts so much attention, at the same time we're a country that's losing tens of thousands of citizens every year to gun violence. And we don't seem to be able to get control of that in the way we've gotten control of the terrorism issue. STEPHANIE RUHLE: This is such a good point. BRET STEPHENS: I suspect someone is, you can guess, is going to want to turn this into an immigration story. This is not a story about lax immigration rules. RUHLE: Does that someone's name rhyme with shmump? STEPHENS: Maybe. And I think that's a point it’s important to put out very early to the extent that these attacks are thwarted as so many of them are, they rely on very effective communication between the police and various communities. That can't take place when you're demonizing entire categories of people or suggesting that because someone may have come as an immigrant that we should just bar the door to immigration from all Muslim countries. RUHLE: Then why when you talk to people across America are they so concerned about national security? When you talk about all of the possible terror plots that have been thwarted, and the number really is low, it doesn't seem like America feels like the number's low. It seems like America thinks it's out of control. STEPHENS: Look, this is exactly it. And I think commissioner Bratton puts it exactly in perspective. We just had a mass shooting in Las Vegas in which 58 people were killed and we act as if -- it almost never happened. There's -- what happened to legislation to at least stop bump stocks from turning semiautomatics into automatic weapons? This has become a tool of political convenience. And people ought to stop and say just look how successful policing is, has been throughout the United States to stop terrorism. Let's look at these things in their right perspective.

          / CBS News Michael Caster was one of the hundreds of people hurt when a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas earlier this year. CBS News' Adriana Diaz met Caster just two days after the massacre and has been following his progress ever since. Caster was shot in the back. His girlfriend Tawny Temple risked her life to get him to the hospital.    ""Well, I did take a bullet for her. So she was just paying me back,"" he joked while back at home in California for a brief visit before heading back to Denver for therapy. Doctors said it was too dangerous to remove the shrapnel lodged in Caster's spine, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. But Caster is a fighter. And for the last eight weeks, recovery has been his full-time job at Craig Hospital, a rehab center in Denver. At 41, he has to re-learn what used to be second nature.   ""You never think of all the things that you took for granted, you know? That were so easy, going to the bathroom, or just sitting in a chair,"" Caster said. ""I go through some times where I get angry but it's not going to change anything. I just got to kind of take it how it is."" He says he hasn't really thought about that night or watched much news since then. He's focused on moving forward. ""We've kind of just been focused on rehab and getting home,"" he said. Temple put her life and job on hold to be with him. ""He'd do it for me, in a heartbeat,"" she said. Now, they're learning how to navigate life in a new way: everything from boarding a plane to getting in a car with special hand controls.    Caster's family has a GoFundMe page to help pay for his recovery, a new wheelchair-accessible home and car. What he's most looking forward to about going home? ""Just being back. Seeing her dogs, her roommates, my family, my dog,"" Caster said.    He's only home for a few days before he returns to Denver for outpatient therapy. And again, Temple will be by his side.   ""She saved me. She's my hero,"" Caster said. ""I don't look at it as that. I look at it as like we saved each other,"" she responded. The official Las Vegas Victims' Fund, created to help victims of the mass shooting, has raised more than $14 million. The cutoff date for donations is January 31.

After all, prequel 2016 had set things up nicely: killing off a few characters, juicing the sense of a new populist age dawning. What chance would there be for our serotonin systems against a year that opened with Donald J Trump being gifted control of the free world? Not even the episode of Quantum Leap where Scott Bakula finds himself inhabiting the body of Bobo the astrochimp held out such rich and immediate potential. Would the Persian Gulf burn? Would the Korean peninsula go up in an eerie green glow? Would Trump set fire to his own tie? The traps were loaded, the stakes were huge. There was plenty of conflict, and just enough kook to fill out the exposition sections of the script.  And, initially, it was all that and more. Global terror touched down in various awful new hellscapes. Steve Bannon and Sean Spicer came and went. Anthony Scaramucci evaporated after 10 days. There was the WannaCry malware attack. The Conservatives declared a snap general election that stoved their own heads in and elevated Jeremy Corbyn to the status of folk hero. A member of the Le Pen family proved convincing to a third of French voters, Geert Wilders to nearly a fifth of the Dutch. Gradually, it became apparent that 2017 was being driven by some kind of crazed Michael Bay figure who just didn’t know when to stop. Any time there’s a pause in the action, just slather on another explosion, another warning that the machines are coming to take our jobs, a couple of hurricanes and the POTUS climbing into bed with the far right like it’s The Man in the High Castle. Oh yeah, and then use famously ratchet Ryan Seacrest reality show I Wanna Marry “Harry” as the model for a world in which a British Prince really is swept off his feet by a commoner from the US. Where to go from there? Pretty soon, 2017 had gone full self-referential – and that’s nearly always fatal. The Blowing Up Hollywood episode was the point at which it all became just plain unbelievable. Every five minutes, you’d update the news to notice, passingly, that Jeffrey Tambor, or Kevin Spacey, or Dustin Hoffman, had been felled for ever. Eventually, the “Oooh” of your mouth simply froze into a shock-fatigued “Oh”. Sure, the year shambled on: terror in New York, Venezuela melting, Tom Petty dying within 24 hours of the worst mass-shooting in US history, 280-character Twitter, Russia probes, Yemen, Syria, the Qatari blockade, the Big Ben fiasco. But, really, the world just shook its head; neither sad nor happy, but uncomprehending, like a parent accidentally exposed to Wiley’s Snapchats. 2017 was just pixels dancing on a screen, mere dots of cordite and food banks and sex robots. We’d tuned out. Now, global oblivion was merely a car alarm going off outside a cokey dinner party at midnight. Occasionally someone would stagger up from the bathroom going: “Hey, is that the sound of the Paris climate accord being torn up? And the Iran nuclear deal? Hey, did Apple just have the gall to skip the iPhone 9 and go straight to X? Hey, are all four Kardashians really simultaneously pregnant?” Pfft.

272,http://theweek.com/10things/739819/10-things-need-know-today-january-1-2018,"Stephanie Keith/Getty Images 1 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a televised New Year's Day address that he is ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea. Kim additionally boasted that he has a nuclear button on his desk and could attack the U.S., but said he would only use the weapons if threatened. The mixed message came after a year of escalating tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests. Kim called his country ""a peace-loving and responsible nuclear power,"" and said he would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February. A spokesman for South Korea's presidential Blue House said Seoul has ""always stated our willingness to talk with North Korea any time and anywhere."" 2 People around the world welcomed the new year with fireworks, parties, and prayers. In Australia, people in boats watched fireworks over the iconic Sydney Opera House. About 100 people gathered outside the Reina nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey, to honor the 39 people killed in a New Year's mass shooting a year ago. In New York City, revelers braved frigid temperatures to watch the traditional ball drop in Times Square. In Palm Beach, President Trump celebrated at an exclusive gala at his Mar-a-Lago club. Earlier, Trump tweeted: ""As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year."" 3 At least 10 people have been killed in anti-government street protests in Iran, state TV reported Monday. Tens of thousands of people have participated in the demonstrations, which spread across the nation over the weekend in the most significant challenge to the Islamic Republic's leadership since 2009 calls for reform. Demonstrators demanded Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei step down, expressing anger about corruption and the state of their economy. Some chanted that the government was full of thieves and should focus on creating jobs rather than pursuing costly proxy wars in Syria and other countries in a battle for regional influence against rival Saudi Arabia. 4 A gunman ambushed officers responding to a domestic disturbance call near Denver on Sunday, killing a Douglas County deputy, Zackari Parrish, and wounding four other law enforcement officers and two civilians. The alleged attacker, identified as former soldier and lawyer Matthew Riehl, 37, died in a shootout with SWAT team members. Riehl reportedly started posting YouTube videos in November, railing against Lone Tree Police Department officers, including one who apparently had pulled him over in a traffic stop. He posted a video the week before Christmas wearing an Iraqi Freedom Veteran cap and saying he planned to run as a libertarian for Douglas County sheriff, calling the incumbent a clown, although he didn't threaten violence. 5 Houston police called to deal with an intoxicated hotel guest ultimately arrested the man and found a small stash of weapons and ammunition in his top floor room, several floors above the scene of a New Year's Eve celebration that was due to take place hours later. The weapons included an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun, a pistol, and ammunition. ""This was not Las Vegas,"" said an official familiar with the case. ""There was not an arsenal."" The suspect, 49-year-old Russell Lawrence Ziemba, was charged with assaulting a peace officer and trespassing. The Hyatt released a statement saying ""heightened measures are in place"" and the hotel is fully cooperating with law enforcement. 6 Chief Justice John Roberts on Sunday announced that the judiciary system would undergo an evaluation to make sure that law clerks and other court employees were adequately protected from sexual harassment. The statement, in Roberts' 2017 State of the Judiciary Report, came after a prominent appeals court judge, Alex Kozinski, stepped down last month after The Washington Post uncovered allegations that he had subjected former law clerks and other women to sexually inappropriate conduct. ""Events in recent months have illuminated the depth of the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace, and events in the past few weeks have made clear that the judicial branch is not immune,"" Roberts wrote. 7 Heading into a midterm election year that political analysts say could bring Democrats big gains in Congress, President Trump tweeted on Sunday that sapping the power of Republicans could ""kill"" wealth created under his presidency. ""If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day. Now they have a great future — and just beginning!"" Trump also wrote: ""Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election."" Despite what Trump saw as a successful year, he ended 2017 with historically low approval ratings. 8 Millions of people got raises on Monday as minimum wage hikes took effect in 18 states. About 4.5 million workers are getting increases ranging from 5 cents to $1 an hour. In half of the affected states minimum wages are rising automatically to keep pace with inflation, while in the other half ballot measures or new laws have called for boosting wages. The latter category includes Hawaii, California, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, and Rhode Island. Eight states and the District of Columbia have passed new minimum-wage laws over the last two years as a nationwide debate has intensified over raising the minimum wage. The federal minimum has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. 9 A New York family of five was among 12 people killed when a small plane crashed into a mountain shortly after taking off from a Costa Rican airport on Sunday. In addition to Bruce and Irene Steinberg of Scarsdale, New York, who were traveling with their three sons, five other Americans and two Costa Rican pilots also died when the Cessna plane crashed and burst into flames. The Steinbergs were heading to Costa Rica's capital on the last leg of a trip that included a visit to the Pacific coast region, where lush forests and tropical beaches are popular with tourists. Aviation officials could not immediately say what caused the crash. 10 Pope Francis said in a New Year's Eve prayer service in St. Peter's Basilica that God had provided a ""whole and sound"" year in 2017, but ""we humans in so many ways ruined and hurt it with works of death, with lies and injustices,"" although he said people who ""cooperate silently for the common good"" helped ease suffering. ""The wars are the flagrant sign of this repeated and absurd pride,"" he said. ""But so are all the little and big offenses against life, truth, brotherhood, that cause multiple forms of human, social and environmental degradation."" After the service the pope greeted well-wishers in St. Peter's Square. He also celebrates a traditional New Year's Day Mass dedicated to world peace. Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2021.

275,http://time.com/4540095/gretchen-carlsons-next-fight/?xid=newsletter-motto,"When Gretchen Carlson was a cub reporter in Virginia in the early ’90s, she was returning from a shoot in the TV production truck when the cameraman at the wheel suddenly asked her if she had liked it when he attached a microphone under her shirt. “I was touching your breasts,” he noted. Carlson sat bolt upright, then leaned away from him and into the passenger door as far as possible. He continued the one-sided commentary on her breasts all the way to the studio, either not noticing or not caring that his co-worker, only a few months into her first TV job, was repulsed and terrified. When she got back to her office, the assistant news director’s antennae went up. “He knew something was wrong,” she says now. “Probably because I was shaking.” After he insisted that she spill the beans, she reluctantly recounted what had happened. The cameraman was fired. Maybe this story sounds like an unfortunate encounter with a creep in a bygone era. But in recent days, it has become clear that it’s not an aberration, and hardly history. After a tape surfaced of Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for President, joking about sexual aggression, millions of women, from all points on the political spectrum, joined an Internet movement started by a Canadian writer to discuss not just the assaults they had suffered but also the constant, wearing, workaday nature of sexual harassment, using the hashtag #notokay. “I think this is happening every single day to women in all walks of life and in all different types of corporations,” says Carlson, 50, who has become something of a magnet for letters from women who have lost their jobs after complaining about sexually inappropriate behavior at work. “I’ve heard from so many women, from Wall Street to a tiny little town in Alabama. It’s everywhere.” READ: The Teeny Tiny Fine Print That Can Allow Sexual Harassment Claims to Go Unheard Indeed, Virginia would not be the last place where Carlson said she was sexually harassed, nor the last time a person subsequently left his job. But the next time—which happened shortly after she was fired from the Fox News Channel—it would get a lot more press. Carlson, who, as was widely reported at the time, has a settlement agreement with Fox News, declined to answer any questions about her former employer or the end of her career there, but had this to say about Trump: “I am saddened by the prevalence of powerful men disrespecting and objectifying women—and getting away with it for years. I am particularly distressed when people in the public eye who influence our culture perpetuate sexism.” If prognosticators had been asked to guess which prominent woman would be the next whistle-blower on the level of sexual harassment that women are still dealing with in 21st century America, Carlson probably wouldn’t have made the short list. Until June, the former Miss America made her living poking at political correctness from one of the most conservative news outlets in the country. And she seemed born to the role. Carlson’s childhood babysitter was Michele Bachmann, a former Tea Party favorite. Her family nickname was Sparkles. Her best friend was until recently the president of a company that sells collectible holiday figurines. She opposed Festivus—a joke celebration made up on Seinfeld—because it denigrated Christmas. Carlson is not only an actual Sunday-school teacher; she struck writer William Goldman as having the potential to be “the most dedicated Sunday-school teacher in the history of the Western world.” Goldman, the Academy Award–winning screenwriter of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President’s Men, was a Miss America judge the year Carlson won. He was appalled. He had predicted that Miss Piggy, as he called her, had only slightly better chances of winning than he did. He was also strangely prescient, in that a lot of men who were to decide the young Minnesotan’s fate would miscalculate her intellect, drive and resilience. In person, Carlson is short—5 ft. 3 in.—and it’s sometimes hard to tell if she’s wincing or smiling. She lives in a stately $5 million house in Greenwich, Conn., with two kids, a husband and an overly friendly nonshedding Lagotto Romagnolo dog who carries a Donald Trump chew toy that says Bite me. (She claims to also own a Hillary Clinton one, but the dog does not favor it.) The house is hotel-lobby spotless, with manicured lawns, gigantic sectional sofas inside and out, a three-car garage and zero evidence that there is a single unresolved item on the family’s to-do list; nothing on the fridge door, no random pile of papers on the kitchen counter, no half-empty cans of Carlson’s beverage of choice, Diet Dr Pepper. She has been married for 19 years to Casey Close, 53, a sports agent who is used to dealing with prodigies; he represents baseball stars Derek Jeter and Clayton Kershaw. The immaculate home, he says, is her doing. “She has the ability to multitask like no other woman I’ve ever met,” he says. “Many of our friends and even family members wonder how we are able to do it.” When she was on morning TV, she could go from waking up to being out the door in nine minutes, and that included showering. She advised one of her successors to set three alarm clocks. The couple recently took their annual couples-only vacation, this time to Croatia. It was planned long before June 23, when Carlson was let go from her show The Real Story With Gretchen Carlson, but the timing proved fortuitous. Since leaving Fox, says Carlson, she has been “incredibly busy.” Always formidably task-oriented, she now has more flexibility to give a whole afternoon instead of just an hour to a crafts project with her kids, Kaia, 13, and Christian, 11. She attends many more of her daughter’s soccer and her son’s hockey and baseball games. (He also plays golf, tennis and basketball.) She joined the board of an animal shelter started in memory of a Sandy Hook shooting victim. But it’s clear that Carlson won’t stay on the sidelines for long. “When she wants something, she goes and gets it,” says Close. “She doesn’t wait for it. I think there are people who might want someone as a spouse who’s a little less vocal about issues, who maybe takes a more passive role, but I feel lucky to have found her and found that kind of relationship.” Carlson has agreed to testify before Congress after the election about forced arbitration, fine print that permits companies to have new employees sign away their rights to litigation and instead agree to settle all employment disputes via arbitration. “A lot of people that I’ve heard from [about being unfairly dismissed] find themselves in the middle of either legal action or, more likely, forced arbitration,” she says. “It is a huge problem. Because it’s secret. And it plays into why we think that we’ve come so far in society and we probably really haven’t—because we don’t hear about it.” The sponsors of the anti-forced-arbitration laws are Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy and Al Franken. That’s the same Al Franken who wrote the best seller Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot. Carlson brushes off the extreme unlikeliness of these political partners with a joke about how she and Franken are both from Minnesota and were on Jeopardy! together. (Franken crushed her.) She has already boned up on some of the legislative history. “The intent of the Supreme Court when they ruled on arbitration was to unclog the courts,” she says. “It was not to put issues of discrimination and harassment into covert operations.” Carlson hopes to persuade Congress to take another look at the laws that protect the practice. She says she’s also going to think really hard about “what we need to do to change the system so that women feel safe.” She is not convinced that human-resources departments are capable of effectively dealing with sexual harassment, or that the millions of dollars corporations spend on training courses is making any difference. “I’m certainly not going to sit here today and say, ‘Well, I know how to solve this just because I’ve experienced it.'” It’s not that Carlson has become a fan of the nanny state; she stresses that parents ought to teach their kids how to treat others. But she thinks corporations have a role to play too. “It also depends on the tone that is set within an organization, because that trickles all the way down,” she says. “We need more women in higher roles, because the tone for sexual harassment would no doubt be different.” Just as it was Nixon who went to China and the Pharisee Paul who spread the Gospel to the gentiles, Carlson may be the improbable ambassador who can take the issue of sexual harassment beyond the liberal mainstream, a crowd that was already converted by Anita Hill. It doesn’t hurt that she’s bringing with her old-school values like discipline, hard work and talent. (Those very qualities didn’t help Hill.) Her childhood in Anoka, Minn., the Halloween capital of the world, was defined by violin and faith. She grew up in a large Lutheran church, of which her grandfather was the pastor. Her dream was to play piano, but her hands were deemed too small, so she focused on violin. Raised by the Swedish equivalent of a tiger mom—a woman who at the age of 72 took over her husband’s car dealership and has, according to Carlson, grown it—the youngster had to practice at least an hour a day from the age of 6, and three hours a day from the age of 10, which left little time for hanging out with friends. “My parents would say, ‘If you just had her focus, with your talent, you would do great,'” says Gary Levinson, now senior principal associate concert master at the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, who often competed in the same violin competitions as Carlson as a teenager. Levinson says the youthful Carlson had an unusual combination of rigor and sentiment, and her particular skill was adding extra oomph to the more romantic pieces. “My vibrato was my weakness,” says Carlson. “With romantic pieces I could be a lot more schmaltzy. My wider vibrato fit that.” Discipline and playing to the emotions of the crowd were not the only music-related skills she would find useful in her TV career. She also had to learn how to blend in, because being an A student and violin prodigy does not make for incredible popularity in high school. She likes to tell the story of playing a morning concert with the Minnesota Orchestra when she was 13, then changing out of her gown and going to school for a math test. “The kids at school had no idea where I had been,” says Carlson. “I just wanted to be included and get along with everyone. I used to say to my parents, ‘I just want to be normal.'” This aptitude for camouflage would come in handy when, on Fox & Friends, the honors graduate of Stanford University would profess the need to look up such terms as ignoramus or czar when commenting on public policy. She was accused by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show of “stashing her IQ in an offshore account.” But Carlson claims that she did not dumb herself down for TV. “Of course I knew what those words were,” she says. Feigned ignorance was merely part of her repertoire. It was while Carlson was studying abroad at Oxford University that her mother, still sore that her daughter had given up her dreams of a career in violin at 17, suggested that she enter the Miss America pageant, which had just announced that 50% of its judgment of a young woman’s worth would be based on talent. Carlson is not statuesque, nor, she says, was she very thin. She hadn’t been playing much music and had lost some dexterity. Most of the consultants she and her mom hired told her she’d need four years minimum to have a shot. Nevertheless, a year after she entered her local pageant, there she was, Miss America. Ironically, few things prepped Carlson better for having people diminish and dismiss her as that year in the tiara. “After I became Miss America, I found out overnight that people just automatically don’t like you,” she says. “It’s like your résumé just falls into oblivion and everything you’ve accomplished in your life has been erased.” She suggested to her college newspaper that the negative reaction from her fellow Stanford students might have been jealousy. The slights she experienced that year still gnaw at her. And she’s not one to let things go. The first story in her 2015 memoir Getting Real is about Penny Crone, a brash New York City TV reporter who questioned her virginity and intelligence during an early press conference. Carlson never forgot it. Many years later, she saw Crone, a local reporter still, at a sports game. She reintroduced herself, reminded her of their first meeting and observed, “I’m a CBS News correspondent … and you’re not.” (Crone, now a real estate agent, remembers the news conference but not the confrontation.) Apparently Carlson likes her revenge like other Swedes like their aquavit: icy cold. After a tour of duty in a few smaller markets, in 2000, Carlson scored a national spot at CBS, where she was eventually promoted to anchor of the Saturday-morning news show. “She was kind of a model employee,” says Andrew Heyward, CBS News’ president at the time. “She was ambitious in a good way and she was serious. She did not play the beauty-queen card at all.” Another Miss America, the woman Carlson handed off to, Debbye Turner Bell (special talent: marimba), worked a few steps down the hall. “She outworked everyone else,” says Turner. “The anchors get these big packets of information for every segment. It was dozens and dozens if not in the low hundreds of pages of reading, and I’m sure not one word went unread and digested by Gretchen, because that’s just the kind of workhorse she is.” In 2005, she moved to Fox. She says she would do the same thing today, adding, “It was an opportunity to do what I loved, which was a morning show, and do it five days a week. In my mind it was an opportunity to grow.” It also meant that she could talk on the air about her beliefs. “My faith is something I don’t question,” she says. “It’s one thing that I don’t lay awake at night wondering about.” But she doesn’t question her commitment to feminism, which may surprise some. “I’ve been for women’s empowerment my entire life. It’s not like it’s just happened in the last couple of months,” she says. Carlson claims she has often called out discrimination, saying, “I’ve been very outspoken about it. For decades. I’d tell my mom something that happened at work, and she’d be like, ‘Well, why do you have to harp on that all the time?’ Then she ended up running a corporation and she called me up and she goes, ‘Oh. Now I get it.'” And Carlson, a registered Independent, is cautiously supportive of some forms of gun control. After the mass shooting of elementary-school kids in nearby Newtown, her daughter, heir to Carlson’s musical proficiency, played a benefit concert of classical piano pieces for some of the victims’ families. Just weeks before Carlson was fired, she had begun to speak out in favor of an assault-weapons ban on Real Story. Levinson, Carlson’s former violin competitor, thinks Carlson should take her settlement money, “buy a Strad and start practicing.” So far, though, she hasn’t committed. “I haven’t picked it up yet,” she says. “But it’s made its way from the closet to a bench in my room. It’s traveled.” She can’t bear to play at the moment—even if nobody except the babysitter is home—because she is so out of practice. Elsewhere, she’s not afraid to make a racket. That includes before Congress. She’s aware that a lot of women who suffer discrimination can’t take on the corporations they work for. “These attitudes thrive when good people don’t speak up, enablers excuse the hateful or disparaging remarks as funny, and surrogates lie about the culture,” she says. Carlson seems to be mulling where her voice is best used. She says she has received several unsolicited calls about TV jobs, and she’d love to go back on the air. One of the Carlson’s first onscreen appearances was on a bloopers show. The setup was to leave the newly minted Miss America alone with a complicated piece of technology—known, in an attempt at jocularity, as the M.I.S.S. America. As the cameras rolled on the purportedly live segment, everyone was mysteriously called away from the set so that the pageant princess had to talk about the contraption alone. The hope was, no doubt, that she would produce some kind of babbling nonsense, or tears, or expressions of utter terror, or something equally diverting. But she declined to be rattled and, no matter what producers asked her to do, fairly nailed it. The segment is still watchable on YouTube, a cautionary tale for anyone who thinks they’ve got Carlson pegged. This appears in the October 31, 2016 issue of TIME.

276,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/politics/~3/iH_EEjvzMKI/,"President Donald Trump weighed in on the deadly Amtrak train derailment in Seattle on Monday, tweeting that the incident emphasizes the need for infrastructure reform. “The train accident that just occurred in DuPont, WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!” Trump tweeted Monday afternoon. Eleven minutes later he followed up with a second tweet, offering sympathies for those impacted. “My thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in DuPont, Washington. Thank you to all of our wonderful First Responders who are on the scene. We are currently monitoring here at the White House.” At least six people were killed Monday when an Amtrak train derailed off a highway in Washington state Monday morning, according the Associated Press. Amtrak said there were 78 passengers and five crew members on the train when it derailed. Trump’s tweets were sent shortly before he was set to deliver an address on his national security strategy. At the top of his remarks, Trump reiterated the sentiments from his tweets, offering thoughts and prayers, emphasizing that the White House was coordinating with local authorities, and monitoring the situation, but that the country needed to fix its infrastructure. The President’s decision to call for policy changes after the train derailment is a deviation from his refusal to discuss concrete measures after other national tragedies, like October’s mass shooting in Las Vegas. When asked about gun control policy in the day after the attack, the Trump administration said it was too soon to discuss any policy. After an attack in New York City on Halloween killed eight people, Trump tweeted that he had ordered the Department of Homeland Security to increase vetting measures, and called for an end to the diversity lottery program that enabled the suspect to enter the country.

While multiple media outlets have reported that the hotel hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve parties in Houston, police have indicated that the man did not pose any specific threats to Houston or to any New Year's Eve party. Additionally, the hotel is within easy walking distance of the downtown George R. Brown Convention Center, which is currently hosting the Houston GRB Gun and Knife Show, the largest gun show in Houston.  According to the Houston Chronicle, hotel security attempted to get a drunk and disorderly patron at the hotel bar to return to his room, but the patron refused and began to fight with hotel security. Accordingly, they called police, who intended to place the patron under arrest for drunk and disorderly conduct. The police escorted the patron back up to his room to allow him to retrieve his belongings, when they noticed several firearms and ""large amounts of ammunition"" in his hotel room. They placed him under arrest and also towed his truck in order to check it for more weapons. According to the Chronicle, police found an AR-15, a shotgun, and a handgun.  Multiple media outlets, including Time and CBS, have speculated about the connection between the hotel and a major New Year's Eve party, implying that the man may have intended to carry out a Las Vegas-style mass shooting. However, after an extensive investigation, Houston police have indicated that they do not believe the man posed a threat. According to the Houston Chronicle, one officer familiar with the case said ""this was not Las Vegas,"" and that ""there was not an arsenal."" The police also indicated that the man owned all three guns legally and that he is not currently facing charges related to the guns. Additionally, the man made no threats related to the guns or a party. Because of the extent of his intoxication, the suspect was not able to be interviewed in the early morning hours on Sunday.

278,http://dailycaller.com/2017/12/14/acosta-spreads-misleading-stats-about-mass-shootings/,"(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) CNN’s Jim Acosta tweeted some incredibly misleading statistics about mass shootings on Thursday morning. In order to commemorate the anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting, Acosta linked to a Vox article that claims there have been 1,552 mass shootings since then. Since Sandy Hook there have been at least 1,552 mass shootings, with at least 1,767 people killed and 6,227 wounded. https://t.co/RZeFDHhYmR — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) December 14, 2017  The Vox article is probably more useful for narrative-building than accuracy, because it gathers its data from the “Gun Violence Archive,” which uses one of the broadest definitions for mass shootings. The Gun Violence Archive counts any shooting with four or more people shot and injured or killed as a “mass shooting.” California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Sen. Richard Pan used the GVA data last year, and Politifact rated their statements about mass shootings “mostly false.” “GVA uses a purely statistical threshold to define mass shooting based ONLY on the numeric value of 4 or more shot or killed, not including the shooter,” the Gun Violence Archive explains on their website. “GVA does not parse the definition to remove any subcategory of shooting. To that end we don’t exclude, set apart, caveat, or differentiate victims based upon the circumstances in which they were shot.” By using this definition, GVA lumps shootings that don’t square with most people’s understanding of what a mass shooting is, such as domestic, gang, and drug-related shootings. For example, GVA would include a gang shootout as a mass shooting, even though not all of the injuries or deaths were inflicted by a single shooter. They would also include a home invasion, even though common understanding is that mass shootings take place in public. Mother Jones uses a more traditional definition of mass shootings for their research. They define a mass shooting as an event where four or more people have been wounded or killed by gunfire in a public place, excluding robberies or gang shootings. Their data was last updated in November 2017, and counts 95 mass shootings over the past 35 years. That’s a far cry from Acosta’s claim that there have been over 1500 in just the last five years.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Noor Salman, wife of Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen, was ordered to stand trial in Orlando in March 2018. (AP Photo) The wife of Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub last year in the name of ISIS, will stand trial in the Florida city, a judge ordered Wednesday. Noor Salman’s attorneys had filed a motion in September to have her trial moved to another city, claiming that media coverage of her husband’s attack and remarks from Orlando Police Chief John Mina wouldn’t allow her to have a fair trial, according to WESH. Noor Sulman faces charges of aiding and abetting, obstruction of justice Salman has been charged with providing material support to a terror organization and obstruction of justice, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Salman’s husband, Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded almost 70 others when he opened fire at Pulse nightclub on June 12, 2016 in one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. The gay bar on the night of the shooting was packed with more than 300 people. Mateen called 911 when he was pulling off the attack to pledge his allegiance to ISIS, and was shouting “Allahu akbar” while engaging officers, law enforcement sources told Fox News around the time of the attack. Salman knew about her husband's plan before the shooting and how he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terror group, prosecutors said. She shopped with her husband the night before the attack when he bought five containers of ammunition, a source close to the investigation told Fox News. Prosecutors have said Salman knew about her husband's plan to attack Pulse nightclub before the mass shooting occurred.
      (AP Photo) The motion filed for Salman, according to the Sentinel, cited remarks made by the police chief, one of which said: “I am glad to see that Omar Mateen’s wife has been charged with aiding her husband in the commission of the brutal attack on the Pulse nightclub.” PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING: 49 VICTIMS REMEBERED ONE YEAR LATER The statement stems from comments Mina made when Salman was arrested in January. He said her arrest provides “some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime.” The judge’s order quoted a U.S. Supreme Court ruling which said, “prominence of media coverage does not necessarily produce prejudicing and juror impartiality does not require ignorance,” WESH reported. Salman’s trial is scheduled for March 1.

WFXT reported that a banner placed above the nativity scene reads: ""If only you knew the things that make for peace."" St. Susanna's Father Stephen Josoma told KTRK-TV that he hopes the reminder of those killed in mass shooting paired with a display of Jesus will persuade people to call for gun control. Josoma explained to WFTX that he hopes the list will spark conversation to effect change: ""There’s cities, nursing homes, coffee shops, military installations, churches, theaters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Five years after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school, advocates who are disappointed with the failure of efforts to limit access to firearms are changing their strategy. Instead of pressuring lawmakers to push new gun-control measures through the U.S. Congress, volunteers from groups including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America are now running for office themselves. Nine of 13 volunteers trained by the group ran for office this year and won seats, ranging from New Hampshire state representative to city council member in West University Place, Texas. Fourteen more have already declared their intentions to run for office in 2018, seeking seats in Congress, state legislatures and local government, all running as Democrats. “The reality is that the work doesn’t really start in Congress. That’s where it ends,” said Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts, who launched her group the day after the Dec. 14, 2012, massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The group began training candidates after more than 400 of its 70,000 members said they were interested in running for office. “This is a marathon, not a sprint,” Watts said. “It’s going to take several election cycles.” Even if the next class of candidates, none of whom are running as Republicans, succeed in winning office, they will face an uphill battle against a U.S. Congress controlled by Republicans, who are staunch defenders of the right to bear arms protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Sandy Hook was at the time the second-deadliest mass shooting carried out by a single gunman in U.S. history. It sparked new energy among gun-control advocates who pushed for fresh federal restrictions on assault weapons, which were blocked by Republican lawmakers and the powerful National Rifle Association lobby. A steady stream of mass shootings have continued across the United States since Sandy Hook, including two deadlier incidents — the slaughter of 58 people at a Las Vegas concert in October and the massacre of 49 people at an Orlando gay nightclub last year. Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was among the 20 first graders killed in Newtown, said he believes grass roots achievements like the new crop of gun-control candidates will lead to more action. “This is a social change and it takes time,” Barden said. “What’s happening in Congress notwithstanding, the change is going to come from the ground up.” In the meantime, Barden is working with Sandy Hook Promise, a volunteer effort to prevent more shooting deaths. The group said that in the past two years it has trained 2.5 million students and families to recognize signs of potential gun violence and report them to authorities. Social change, whether it is about drunk driving or recycling, comes from the ground up, said Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son Dylan died in the Sandy Hook attack. “In the gun violence prevention movement, we have not focused on getting behavioral change. It’s all been focused on top-down and that is not how you get change,” she said. Next year’s class of gun-control candidates includes a mother whose son was shot dead and a bystander paralyzed from the middle of her chest down in a drive-by shooting. Lara Kennedy is running for U.S. House of Representatives in the Texas district that encompasses Austin and north of San Antonio. Lucy McBath, whose only child Jordan Davis was shot dead after an argument over music while parked in Florida in 2012, is running for the Georgia House of Representatives. In Arizona, Jennifer Longdon, who was wounded in a random 2004 shooting, also is seeking to become a state representative. In Arkansas, Adrienne Kvello is challenging incumbent Republican state Representative Charlie Collins, who sponsored bills to put more guns on college campuses, in courthouses and the state capitol. Amber Gustafson, a gun-owning Moms Demand Action volunteer and life-long Republican who switched her party registration to Democrat last year, said if she wins her race for an Iowa state Senate seat, she will fight for gun safety laws aimed at preventing another Sandy Hook. “I‘m pro people defending their Second Amendment rights. But I also believe and know that good laws can really protect lives,” Gustafson said.",2017-12-14 10:53:54,"5 years after Sandy Hook, gun control advocates are fed up with the lack of action — so they're running for office themselves","education and schools,politics and government,law and legislation,gun control,firearms,children and youth,murders and attempted murders",18710,http://www.businessinsider.com
282,http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/21/us/terror-littleton-overview-2-students-colorado-school-said-gun-down-many-23-kill.html,"Advertisement Supported by TERROR IN LITTLETON: THE OVERVIEW By James Brooke In the deadliest school massacre in the nation's history, two young men stormed into a suburban high school here at lunch time today with guns and explosives, killing as many as 23 students and teachers and wounding at least 20 in a five-hour siege, the authorities said. The two students who are believed to have been the gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who were students at Columbine High School, were found dead of self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the library, said Steve Davis, the spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. Beginning about 11:30 A.M., the gunmen, wearing ski masks, stalked through the school as they fired semiautomatic weapons at students and teachers and tossed explosives , with one student being hit nine times in the chest by shrapnel, the authorities said. Gunshots continued to ring out at the school for hours. One bomb exploded in the library, officials said, and one in a car outside. Two more cars were rigged with bombs. About 3 P.M., hundreds of police officers evacuated the building and searched for the gunmen. Their bodies and those of several of their victims appeared to have been wired with explosives. Sheriff John Stone said, ''It appears to be a suicide mission.'' Mr. Davis said that as many as 25 people were dead, ''a mixture of students and faculty.'' He said that most of the bodies were found in the school's entrance, the library and the commons cafeteria. No precise death toll was available. Kaleb Newberry, 16, said: ''I was in class and one teacher came in and basically told us to run for our lives, I saw a girl maybe five paces behind me fall. She was shot in the leg, but a teacher helped her.'' Students said the gunmen were part of a group of misfits who called themselves the trench coat mafia, which expressed disdain for racial minorities and athletes. Members of the group found their way out of anonymity at the school by banning together, dressing in dark gothic-style clothing including long black coats. They became easy to notice among the 1,870 students at the school, since every day, regardless of the weather, they wore their coats. [Page A17.] Today the gunmen appeared to aim at minority members and athletes at the 1,800-student school, as well as peers who had poked fun at the group in the past. School officials had had no reports of trouble from the suspects, Mr. Davis said. Some victims were forced to wait inside the school for rescue. By early evening, bodies had not been removed because of the crime scene investigation and the possible presence of explosives, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department said. Mr. Davis said at a news conference tonight that two other students at the school, thought to be friends of the gunmen, were in custody for questioning in connection with the shooting. ''You can't really go in and do this kind of damage without a lot of preparation.'' Mr. Davis said, ''without a lot of ammunition and apparently some type of bombs.'' Fourteen-year-old Katie Corona, said she was trapped in a classroom with her teacher and about 30 classmates for hours. ''I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ''I really didn't think I was going to make it. We would hear shots, then we heard crying. We had no clue what was going on.'' ''Everyone around me got shot and I begged him for 10 minutes not to shoot me,'' one young woman, who was not identified, said tonight in an interview broadcast on the Cable News Network. ''And he just put the gun in my face and started laughing and saying it was all because people were mean to him last year.'' Another student, who said she heard more gunshots while hiding in the closet with a teacher and some friends, said she kept thinking to herself, ''This can't be happening to our school.'' ''You should be safe at school,'' added a second young woman, who also was not identified. ''This should be a safe place.'' The families of those killed were being notified tonight at Leawood Elementary School, where students and parents had gathered. The mass shooting was the first at an American school during this academic year, but revived memories of similar tragedies that struck six different communities last year and set off national alarms about teen-age violence. Four girls and a teacher were shot to death and 10 people were wounded during a false fire alarm at a middle school in Jonesboro, Ark., last March. President Clinton immediately dispatched a crisis-response team to aid the school community and the victim's families. ''We don't know yet all the how's or why's of this tragedy; perhaps we will never fully understand it,'' the President said in a nationally televised news conference just before 8 P.M. ''St. Paul reminds us that we all see things in life darkly, that we only partly understand what is happening.'' He added, ''We do know that we must do more to reach out to our children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons.'' A sunny spring day turned into a bloody nightmare for this suburb of 35,000 people southwest of Denver, as ambulances ferried the injured from the high school, past tennis courts, a baseball diamond and a packed student parking lot. ''I hope we can all pull together, because we will need all our strengths,'' Jane Hammond, Jefferson County superintendent of schools, said tonight. The blood banks in the Denver area have been overwhelmend with calls from donors. Tonight at least three church vigils for the dead and injured. Just before 8 P.M., Lisa Appleton, 16, a sophomore, waited in front of the Leawood school for news of her best friend, Julie Toms, who had been missing since students began leaving the school. ''I can't even feel it,'' she said. ''There's no way to know whether she's dead or alive.'' About 3 P.M., SWAT teams police officers used a fire truck and an armored car to get close to the building, dozens of students raced out of the two-story building, some slipping in the mud, others holding up their hands in the air or behind their heads. Police said they feared that the gunmen would try to escape by mingling with the trapped students. One student, bloodied from an injury, broke out a second-story window, and climbed down into the hands of the police. As police officers established a wide perimeter around the beige school, students and school workers gathered on nearby tree-lined streets and told of the chaos and horror inside the building. As fire alarms rang in the halls, students who had seen the gunmen trampled each other to get out of the building, running through one exit where three bodies lay on a staircase. Trapped inside, others took refuge in classrooms, bathrooms and a choir room, frantically barricading doors with desks and file cabinets. One cafeteria worker who barricaded herself in a woman's bathroom said, ''We could hear them blowing the heck out of the place.'' A student, Jonathan Ladd, said, ''I heard gunshots going off, bullets ricocheting off lockers.'' The trench coat mafia is a small band of about a dozen juniors and seniors at Columbine who are easily recognized yet little feared, according to people who live in the neighborhood near the school. Regardless of the weather, they favor long black coats and the Gothic look popularized by the rock singer Marilyn Manson, neighbors said. Some even wear white pancake makeup and dark eyeliner, one student said. ''It was that devilish, half-dead, half-alive look,'' said Bret, a 16-year-old sophomore who spoke on the condition only his first name be used. The group often gathered in the cafeteria after school. Chris McCaffrey, manager of Angie's Restaurant a few blocks from Columbine, said that residents had known about the group for about five years, and that no one considered it a threat. ''Mostly it was just kids who nobody wanted to have anything to do with,'' Mr. McCaffrey said. ''They weren't particularly feared. They were just a bunch of punks who kind of hang around the school.'' Students said the group was mostly boys, but that some girls appeared to be closely associated with it. One student described the group as ''nerds, geeks and dweebs trying to find someplace to fit in.'' Bret suggested the mafia might have targeted athletes out of resentment for their own lack of popularity and success at school. The students ''weren't really accepted as younger kids and as they got older they were accepted by this group,'' Bret said. ''They got their fair share of being picked on. I could understand that they might have targeted some of the more popular kids.'' David Mesch, another student, who was searching for his mother who works for the school, said, ''They were wearing masks; they were members of the trench coat mafia.'' President Clinton said tonight that he was ''profoundly shocked and saddened by the tragedy today in Littleton.'' In an age when cellular telephones are increasingly common among high school students, several trapped students called television stations when they could not get through on 911 lines. ''I hear a couple of gunshots, people running up and down,'' a student said in a frightened whisper to KUSA-TV, a Denver television station. Identifying himself only as James, he added, ''There are a bunch of kids downstairs, I can hear them crying.'' Aware that the gunmen might be watching on a classroom television set, he said, ''I am staying upstairs,'' and then hung up. In a state with a relatively low crime rate, the siege after the shootings was broadcast live by Denver television stations, without commercial breaks all afternoon. Broadcast and cable networks turned to local affiliates for help with their coverage. ''This is a cultural virus,'' Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said before hurrying to the scene. Noting that he felt particularly affected by the tragedy because his 16-year-old daughter goes to a suburban Denver high school, he said, ''We have to ask ourselves what kind of children we are raising.'' At the White House, the President said the nation should focus on praying for the victims' families and others at the school. He said that Attorney General Janet Reno was closely monitoring the situation, and that he had spoken this afternoon with Governor Owens and Patricia Holloway, the county commissioner, whose comments he shared with the nation. In midafternoon, police officers briefly detained three young white men who wore camouflaged pants and black jackets, next to the high school. After they were released, the men said they knew the gunmen inside the high school. Emblazoned on the back of one man's jacket were the words, ''Ban Religion'' and a red-painted stop sign printed over a cross. ''Blood was going all over,'' a shaken girl said, as she was comforted by her father. Those here were reminded of other school shooting incidents. Bob Sapin, a student, told a television station minutes after watching the shootings, ''I just can't believe it is happening at my school.''

        Zoe Tillman Reporting From Washington, DC Reporting From Washington, DC Last updated on December 13, 2017, at 4:30 p.m. ET Posted on December 12, 2017, at 4:48 p.m. ET White House officials have confirmed that two of President Donald Trump's controversial judicial nominees, Brett Talley and Jeff Mateer, will not go any further in the confirmation process. BuzzFeed News reported Tuesday night that Talley, who was already voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and was waiting for a final vote in the Senate, had offered to withdraw his nomination last week. Mateer's nomination was submitted by the White House to the Senate in September, but hadn't gone beyond that. The White House on Wednesday confirmed to BuzzFeed News a report from NPR that quoted an administration official as saying that Talley's nomination would not go forward. A White House official also confirmed a separate report from the Washington Post that quoted Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley as saying that Mateer's nomination was over as well. Talley and Mateer are now Trump's first unsuccessful judicial nominees. The defeats come at the end of a year in which the White House and Republicans have pointed to the swift confirmation of conservative judges to lifetime seats on the federal bench as a major accomplishment. The White House did not immediately comment on how or when Talley and Mateer's nominations would end — the administration could withdraw them, or allow them to expire at the end of the congressional session. Talley, nominated to the US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, faced opposition from Democrats and civil rights groups before the judiciary committee voted in favor of his nomination in early November, but he faced new scrutiny after the vote amid revelations about information that wasn't included in his Senate questionnaire. BuzzFeed News first reported on thousands of posts that Talley appeared to have written for a University of Alabama sports fan website, including on gun control, immigration, and other political subjects. In one post on TideFans.com, poster ""BamainBoston,"" who identified himself as Talley in 2014, wrote in response to the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, ""My solution would be to stop being a society of pansies and man up."" Slate highlighted another post by BamainBoston that appeared to defend the early iteration of the Ku Klux Klan. Talley also received a rare ""not qualified"" rating from the American Bar Association. Mateer was nominated to the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. CNN reported that, in 2015, Mateer gave speeches in which he said that transgender children were evidence of ""Satan's plan."" At a recent confirmation hearing for other nominees, Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy had asked questions that suggested he had concerns about Mateer in light of those statements, and Mateer's nomination was opposed by LGBT and other civil rights groups. There were already hints that Mateer's nomination could be in trouble. He was one of 16 judicial nominees announced by the White House on Sept. 7; Talley was also part of that group. Of the 16 nominees, all but two — Mateer and Ryan Bounds, nominated to the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit — have at least had a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and some have already been voted out of committee or confirmed. Mateer's Senate questionnaire, which nominees prepare in coordination with the White House and the Justice Department, was never submitted. Representatives of Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz did not immediately return requests for comment. Information about Talley and Mateer's nominations not moving forward came the day after news broke that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley had reportedly urged the White House to reconsider Talley and Mateer's nomination. A spokesperson for Grassley confirmed to BuzzFeed News that the senator had expressed ""concerns"" to White House staff about statements made by the two nominees. Grassley wasn't the first Republican to take a critical eye to Trump's judicial nominees — Kennedy was the first Republican to break ranks, at least publicly — but given Grassley's perch as head of the Judiciary Committee, his pushback was particularly significant. Asked about reports of Grassley's communications to the White House on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters she would have to look into it. CNN first reported Tuesday that Grassley had communicated his concerns to the White House and had said that he advised the White House to ""reconsider"" Jeff Mateer's nomination and ""not to proceed"" with Talley. A spokesman for Grassley later clarified to BuzzFeed News that Grassley hadn't intended to draw a distinction between the two nominees in describing what he told the White House and that his comments applied to both Mateer and Talley. Talley was already voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee — with Grassley's support — and was waiting for a vote by the full Senate. Because Mateer hadn't had a hearing yet in the committee, Grassley could have still exercised control over whether and when that nomination moves forward. Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy said in an email to BuzzFeed News that Grassley conveyed his concerns to the White House about Talley and Mateer ""at the staff level."" He did not provide details about when those communications took place, who was involved, or what exactly Grassley said. ""Chairman Grassley has been concerned about statements made by nominees Mateer and Talley, and he’s conveyed those concerns to the White House. Revelations of Talley’s statements surfaced only after he was reported out of the Judiciary Committee. Mateer’s nomination paperwork has not yet been received by the Committee, and no further action is scheduled,"" Foy wrote. Talley's critics also pointed to his minimal courtroom experience and the fact that he did not include in a section of his questionnaire that asked about potential conflicts of interest that his wife, Ann Donaldson, is chief of staff to White House Counsel Don McGahn. Democrats and civil rights and liberal advocacy groups have objected to many of Trump's nominees, but have had no success so far in stopping any of them from being confirmed. Judicial confirmations have been a bright spot for the Trump administration and Senate Republicans this year, with McConnell vowing to move nominees through the Senate as quickly as possible and Grassley taking steps to head off Democratic opposition at the committee level. Asked about Grassley's communications to the White House and the status of a full Senate vote on Talley, a spokesman for McConnell said in a email, ""I do not have any scheduling announcements or guidance on any nominees right now."" The Senate is preparing to vote this week on three federal appeals court nominees. Updated with information from the White House about Mateer's nomination status. Updated with information from the White House about Talley's nomination status. Updated with information about Brett Talley's offer to withdraw his nomination. Update with clarification from a spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley about what the senator told a reporter about his communications to the White House.

By JACQUELINE KLIMAS 12/05/2017 04:13 PM EST Updated 12/05/2017 05:12 PM EST The military justice system's failure to share critical information with civilian law enforcement agencies is far more rampant than initially believed, the Pentagon's independent watchdog has found — in some cases nearly a third of the time. After former airman Devin Patrick Kelley shot and killed 26 people in a rural Texas church last month, the Air Force admitted it had not followed the procedure to alert civilian authorities to Kelley’s domestic violence conviction while in uniform — something that would have prevented him from being able to buy a gun. It subsequently found dozens of other such cases. But the problem is far more widespread, the Pentagon's inspector general reported Tuesday. It found a series of ""troubling"" things when it reviewed 2,502 cases across all four military branches between Jan. 1, 2015 and Dec. 31, 2016. Of those, fingerprint cards were not submitted to the FBI in 24 percent of the cases and a final disposition report was not submitted in 31 percent. The military is required to submit data to the FBI when service members are convicted of a number of crimes, including drunk driving, stalking and kidnapping. That information is then included in a federal database that is checked when someone tries to purchase a gun. The Air Force actually performed better than the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, the new IG report found. For example, it failed to submit fingerprint cards and final disposition reports in only 14 percent of convictions, the report found.

The Navy and Marine Corps didn’t submit fingerprint cards in 29 percent of cases and the Army did not submit a final disposition report in 41 percent of its criminal convictions. “The failure to populate FBI databases with all the required fingerprint records can result in someone purchasing a weapon who should not,"" the report says. ""It can also hinder criminal investigations and potentially impact law enforcement and national security interests. It is therefore troubling that many fingerprint cards remained missing.” The IG made several recommendations, including that the military services each review their criminal investigative databases dating back to 1998 to ensure all paperwork is submitted to civilian agencies and they implement greater oversight of the reporting process.

Senior Writer America’s late-night hosts entered 2017 with a mix of trepidation and dread. After spending the better part of two years talking about almost nothing besides Donald Trump, many had hoped a Hillary Clinton win would give them a chance to finally move on. “It’s weird when people say ‘this must be great for you’ about the Trump presidency,” Late Night’s Seth Meyers told The Daily Beast midway through the year. “I feel it’s like being a gravedigger in the Middle Ages and people saying, ‘God this plague must be so good for business.’” The first year of Trump’s presidency has definitely been “good for business”—especially for those hosts like Meyers and Stephen Colbert who have become de facto mouthpieces for the #resistance. But while it has not always provided the plethora of laughs that some fans were expecting, it did help bring about some of the most compelling and unexpected moments in late night’s long history, many of which produced more catharsis than comedy. While more than a few of the entries on the list below came from hosts who decided to forgo jokes in favor of a deeper emotional connection with viewers, there were exceptions to that rule. In the best cases, comedians were able to get laughs while also revealing something profound about the target of their satire, be it Trump or the growing list of disgraced powerful men who have been rightly ousted from public life while the pussy-grabber-in-chief escapes unscathed. 10. John Oliver Coins ‘Stupid Watergate’ In the early days of the 2016 campaign, Last Week Tonight’s John Oliver did everything he could to ignore Donald Trump, famously telling his old Daily Show colleague Stephen Colbert during the GOP primary that he “couldn’t give less of a shit” about the candidate he assumed would be out of the race in no time. A few months later, he dealt Trump what critics hoped might be a knockout punch with his #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain campaign. But while Oliver briefly touched on the president’s latest outrage in nearly every episode of his HBO show this year, he only dedicated one longer segment to him, going all in on the “Stupid Watergate” moniker he coined to sum up the Russia scandal. “We used that framing device because it seemed like the best way to hold the thoughts that we had about the complexities and idiocy around that particular investigation,” Oliver told The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert in an interview last month. “Look, it is not clear what is really going on here yet,” Oliver told viewers in the early days of the investigation. “Although one possibility is that this all amounts to what I’m going to call ‘Stupid Watergate’: a potential scandal with all the intrigue of Watergate, except everyone involved is really bad at everything, and the relevant question isn’t so much of ‘What did the president know and when did he know it’ as it is ‘Is the president physically capable of knowing things at all?’” 9. Jordan Klepper’s Cold Open on Guns Given that he’s playing an over-the-top, Alex Jones-inspired conspiracy theorist character, it was never going to be easy for The Opposition’s Jordan Klepper to deliver the type of sincere reaction to tragedy that has become the norm for late-night hosts. He had his first big test just a few weeks into his new show’s run, the morning after dozens of men, women, and children were gunned down at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. In a deft and darkly funny cold open piece, Klepper sat behind a stack of newspapers and solemnly announced that America had “experienced a heartbreaking, unparalleled tragedy.” But when he picked up a paper from the stack, the headline was about the previous month’s mass shooting in Las Vegas. As it happened again and again, he became more and more frustrated. “These are all mass shootings from this year?!” Klepper asked his producer. “This is too much! All of this is too much, right here. We need to do something about this... desk.” 8. Sarah Silverman’s Louis C.K. Monologue Unlike her mostly male counterparts, Sarah Silverman has almost entirely eschewed talking about current events on her Hulu show I Love You, America. But there was one topic she could not ignore during an episode this fall: the sexual misconduct allegations against her friend, Louis C.K. In an emotional monologue that left jokes aside, Silverman delivered the best commentary yet on what it feels like to find out something horrible about someone you admire—or in her case “love.” “It’s a real mindfuck,” Silverman added. “Because I love Louis, but Louis did these things. Both of these statements are true, so I just keep asking myself: ‘Can you love someone who did bad things? Can you still love them?’” It’s an uncomfortable question that so many women and men are asking themselves as this year comes to a close. 7. Larry Wilmore Tells Off Milo Bill Maher is responsible for what was arguably the worst late-night moment of the year. Thankfully, his guest Larry Wilmore helped deliver one of the best. Six months after he lost his Comedy Central show, Wilmore shared the stage with alt-right it-boy Milo Yiannopoulos during Real Time’s “Overtime” segment on YouTube. And he said what many viewers had hoped Maher would say during his cozy interview that opened the episode: “You can go fuck yourself!” 6. Seth Meyers Doesn’t Hold Back on Sexual Predators It took the men of late-night television too long to fully address the bombshell sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein, but once they did, no one was more relentless than Seth Meyers. Forbes rightly got a lot of shit for calling Meyers the “feminist” Golden Globes host Hollywood needs this year, but at least compared to his late-night competitors he has gone above and beyond—not just on Weinstein but also on the men who went down in his wake. And that did not change when the men in question included his fellow SNL alum Al Franken and NBC network-mate Matt Lauer. “This should not be a partisan issue,” Meyers said days after the Weinstein story broke. “Men need to speak up and address their complicity in the system that allows these things to happen.” 5. Colbert Refuses to Apologize to Trump Stephen Colbert has told countless brutal jokes about Donald Trump since taking over The Late Show in 2015. But there was one this spring that, for whatever reason, felt like a bridge too far for supporters of the president. They launched a #FireColbert campaign after he said of Trump, “The only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin’s cock holster.” All of a sudden, the alt-right was horrified that the host had made what some perceived to be a homophobic insinuation. Instead of apologizing, Colbert took a page out of the president’s playbook and doubled down. “I don’t regret that,” the host said of the joke that had so offended Trump. “I believe he can take care of himself. I have jokes, he has the launch codes, so… it’s a fair fight.” He did, however, offer an apology of sorts to anyone in the LGBT community who took offense at his joke. “While I would do it again, I would change a few words that were cruder than they needed to be,” Colbert said. “Now I’m not going to repeat the phrase, but I just want to say, for the record, life is short, and anybody who expresses their love for another person in their own way, is to me, an American hero.” 4. Michael Che Calls Trump a ‘Cheap Cracker’ If Alec Baldwin’s Trump impression started to wear a little thin this fall, “Weekend Update” anchor—and recently named co-head writer along with Colin Jost—Michael Che’s commentary on the president has only gotten tougher. Che came out swinging on Saturday Night Live’s season premiere, delivering an epic rant against Trump for failing to give Puerto Rico the help it desperately needed after Hurricane Maria. “This isn’t a complicated issue, man, it’s hurricane relief,” Che said. “You just did this very same thing for white people, twice. So, tell Melania to put on her flood heels, get some bottled water, some food, pack up some extra Atlanta Falcons Super Bowl T-shirts and write them a check with our money, you cheap cracker!” 3. Sam Bee’s PSA for Men Watching the late-night men struggle to come up with a funny way to talk about the Harvey Weinstein story made Samantha Bee’s seemingly effortless takedown of male entitlement culture all the more essential. In a public service announcement directed at men everywhere, Bee offered up some tips on how to avoid becoming the next Weinstein. “Every day I wake up, get dressed, take the subway to work and then don’t masturbate in front of anyone,” Bee said. “Next time you get the urge to masturbate, just ask yourself, ‘Am I in front of an employee or a colleague?’ And if the answer is ‘yes,’ don’t. Just don’t.” For a host who has become (perhaps unfairly) known for her searing anger, this calm and measured monologue served as the perfect comic response to a story that was anything but funny on its face. 2. The President Show’s Trump Sees a Truck When Comedy Central first announced that it would be producing a weekly talk show centered around comedian Anthony Atamanuik’s Donald Trump impression, it felt like a risky proposition that could suffer from America’s growing Trump fatigue. But once the first episode aired, those fears were lifted thanks to a mostly improvised field piece shot on the streets of New York that included arguably the year’s funniest late-night moment. Atamanuik’s Trump, exhausted from a day of stumbling around Times Square and gorging on fast food, spots a truck driving down the street. “Honk, honk goes the truck!” he says excitedly. But things turn unexpectedly dark when he imagines driving the truck into a river and drowning, “finally at peace” as the water fills his lungs. In a message to The Daily Beast, Atamanuik said that he believes the bit resonated with viewers so much “because it shows Trump as this easily distracted child-man who is dazzled by big trucks and tough guys.” He added, “Then you cut under the surface and see that there is this emotionally stunted, lonely, damaged person who has delusions of grandeur coupled with violently self-destructive fantasies. It captures what scares the shit out of us about Trump.” 1. Jimmy Kimmel Breaks Down Every late-night host likes to think that their words might have some positive impact on the lives of their viewers, even if it’s just giving them a good laugh at the end of the day (or, in many cases, the next morning). Only one can claim that their commentary may have actually saved lives. Jimmy Kimmel’s powerful plea to keep the Affordable Care Act intact after his baby son’s near-death experience was so effective precisely because the messenger was so unexpected. If a relatively apolitical host like Kimmel felt so strongly about this issue, then maybe it was worth paying attention to. Partly thanks to his relentless efforts over several months, Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare, helping to ensure, as Kimmel put it, that “No parent should ever have to decide if they can afford to save their child’s life.” The host has repeatedly said that he wishes he could just go back to making fun of the Kardashians, but with a reality show star occupying the White House, he no longer has that luxury.",2017-12-27 05:00:00,"The 10 Late-Night Moments That Defined 2017: Laughter, Tears, and Plenty of Outrage","politics and government,united states politics and government",1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

287,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/507650916/0/phoenix/nation~Suspect-in-deadly-New-Mexico-high-school-shooting-disguised-himself-as-student/,"AZTEC, New Mexico — When students arrived at Aztec High School on Thursday morning, former student William Atchison, 21, entered the school with them disguised as a student. Police say Atchison carried a backpack with a Glock pistol inside of it. He also had a thumb drive with information on it about his plans to hold a class hostage, kill students and ultimately kill himself. ""He lived in Aztec with his parents, he worked at a local gas station and he planned this thing,"" said San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen. Atchison shot and killed junior Francisco ""Paco"" Fernandez and senior Casey Marquez before taking his own life on Thursday. ""This person is not only a coward,"" Christesen said. ""He's evil."" Read more: Shooter among dead in New Mexico high school shooting On a note he wrote at 6:51 a.m. Thursday, the shooter stated, ""If things go according to plan today, today will be the day that I die."" He then described his plans to ""gear up,"" hold a classroom hostage and ""go apes--t"" and then to ""blow my brains out."" ""Work sucks, school sucks, life sucks,"" the shooter wrote before the event. The note was found on the thumb drive he carried. After he entered the school, Atchison went to the bathroom on the second floor, where he began getting ready for the shooting. Fernandez had asked to be excused from class to go to the bathroom. He walked in on Atchison. State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said Fernandez had no chance to survive. After he shot Fernandez, Atchison killed Marquez when he saw her in the hallway. The school officials had heard the gunshots, and the school went into lockdown. Custodian Thomas Hall pursued the shooter down the hallways, yelling for teachers to lock their doors. Substitute teacher Kathleen Potter did not have the keys to lock the computer lab door. She took the students into a supplies room and barricaded the door with a couch. Atchison entered the computer lab. Police say he knew where the students were in the supplies room, and he fired rounds toward them. None of the students were injured. Christesen said Atchison didn't have a criminal history and was not on the Sheriff's Office's radar. The only interaction Atchison had with police was during an FBI investigation last year. Someone reported a message he wrote on an online gaming site asking about cheap assault rifles for a mass shooting. The FBI did not find any evidence of a crime being committed and ended the investigation. Police say Atchison claimed he had made the post as an Internet troll. He did not have any weapons in 2016 and purchased a Glock legally last month in the San Juan County area, which he used in the shooting, according to police. When searching Atchison's house after Thursday's shooting, police found a note that outlined his schedule for the day. At 8 a.m., Atchison had planned to die.Police say neither victim was targeted.

288,http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/12/house_republican_response_to_las_vegas_massacre_is.html," Gallery: NJ lawmakers oppose concealed carry WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are bringing up their first gun rights bill for a vote since the deadly Las Vegas massacre: a measure that would compel New Jersey to honor concealed weapons permits for people who got them in their home state. The debate, scheduled for this week, comes after two mass shootings in two months, the killing of more than 50 people at a Las Vegas concert in October and more than two dozen parishioners at a Texas church in November. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is the top legislative priority of the National Rifle Association, the gun rights group that spent more money to elect President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans last year than any other outside organization. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, who helped organize the June 2016 House Democratic sit-in to force votes on gun safety measures, called it a ""disgrace"" to make concealed carry the first gun bill after Las Vegas, the worst mass shooting in American history. The legislation ""will make it easier for people -- including those with dangerous histories -- to carry hidden, loaded guns across the country,"" said Watson Coleman, D-12th Dist. ""This bill will jump start a race to the bottom for states to weaken their own gun laws and undermine New Jersey's own attempt to manage gun safety in the manner we best see fit."" The House will not be voting on bills to ban or limit bump stocks, the device that allowed the Las Vegas shooter to convert his semi-automatic rifle into one that fired more rapidly. The legislation on the House floor would require New Jersey, whose residents must to show a ""justifiable need"" before obtaining a concealed weapons permit, and all other states to recognize concealed carry permits the same way they now accept out-of-state drivers' licenses. New Jersey is one of only 10 states that do not honor concealed carry permits issued outside its borders. In states that recognize such permits, ""there's literally no evidence that such policies have unleashed a wave of violence across state borders,"" said Alexander P. Roubian, president of the New Jersey Second Amendment Society, a gun rights group. ""However, many violent crimes and sexual assaults are thwarted by concealed handguns."" Roubian said concealed carry was unrelated to the Las Vegas shooting. In advance of the vote, the gun safety group founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a victim of gun violence, will run TV commercials against Reps. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-11th Dist. and Jason Lewis, R-Minn. The group will also run online ads against those two and six other GOP lawmakers. The group plans to spend more than $100,000. ""We are putting Congress on notice that siding with the gun lobby's campaign cash over public safety will put their careers in jeopardy,"" said Peter Ambler, executive director of the group, now known as Giffords. The concealed carry bill has 214 sponsors, including Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-3rd Dist. MacArthur has said gun owners shouldn't have to fear arrest when they cross state lines and still would have to follow the rules of their home state to get a permit. The NRA last year spent $55 million to elect Donald Trump president and keep Republicans in control of both houses of Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group. ""Law-abiding citizens should be able to exercise their fundamental right to self-defense while traveling across state lines without fear of unknowingly breaking the law,"" said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. Earlier this year, with Trump's support, congressional Republicans voted to repeal regulations designed to keep weapons out of the hands of those with mental problems. A House committee also voted to make it easier to buy gun silencers and armor-piercing bullets, though that bill has yet to reach the floor. Jonathan D.

On December 14, 2012, a 20-year-old man shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut, and opened fire. He killed 20 children (six- and seven-year-olds) and six adults. In the aftermath of the shooting, calls for legislation aimed at limiting access to firearms resulted in what's now become a predictable post-mass-murder event: people bought lots of guns. With more guns around in the following months, rates of accidental death related to firearms rose sharply, especially for children, according to a new study published in the journal Science. Study authors Phillip Levine and Robin McKnight of Wellesley compared the number of accidental firearm deaths during the five months after Sandy Hook (from December 2012 to April 2013) with the amount during the same time period in other years between 2008 and 2015. They found that after Sandy Hook, accidental firearm death rates rose 27% overall, and 64% for children up to the age of 14. That means at least 60 people were killed by mistake as a result of those gun purchases: 40 adults and 20 children. In the five months after the mass shooting, approximately 3 million more guns were sold than would have been expected based on historical trends. Online searches for terms like ""buy gun"" and ""clean gun"" also spiked (especially after President Obama spoke publicly about gun control). The more people who get exposed to guns because they're newly purchased or because they've been brought out of storage, the more likely accidental shootings are to occur. When looking at state data, Levine and McKnight found that the states with the biggest spikes in gun sales also saw the highest spikes in accidental death rates. There are limitations to conducting a study like this, the authors wrote, since the CDC Vital Statistics data they used to calculate gun deaths is known to understate accidental firearm deaths, especially when an accidental injury later results in death. But there are other serious limitations to studying gun deaths too. Lobbying by the National Rifle Association has influenced Congress to avoid funding research that could justify heavier gun control. That means there's no national database of gun purchases, so it's hard to tell how many guns are sold. In this case, the researchers calculated the 3 million sales based on the number of background checks run through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is used by federally licensed gun retailers. NRA lobbying also led congress to cut the CDC budget by $2.6 million — the same amount as the budget of the the centers' gun violence research program, as Philip Cook and John Donohue noted in a public policy analysis published alongside the new study in Science. But Cook and Donohue wrote that research on gun deaths is improving despite these obstacles and lack of federal funding, thanks to support from nonprofit foundations, states like California, and universities. ""The good news, often lost in the well-justified complaints about the lack of federal funding, deserves greater recognition,"" they wrote. Innovative researchers, a spike in interest from journals, and support from institutions aside from the federal government are all helping researchers understand how policies affect gun violence, according to Cook and Donohue. For example, researchers have learned that gun robbery rates have gone down when states enact longer sentences for assault or robbery with a gun. Researchers have also looked at the impacts of the Lautenberg Amendment to the 1968 Gun Control Act, which disqualified people with a conviction for domestic violence from buying or owning weapons. The policy was challenged in certain states, but data shows the states that did ban domestic abusers from gun ownership reduced gun murders by 17%. Analyses have also been conducted on ""right to carry"" laws, which require states to issue concealed-carry permits to anyone who is allowed to own guns and can meet minimum conditions (as opposed to holding concealed carry status to stricter standards). According to Cook and Donohue, such laws increase the rate of firearm homicides by 9% when state-by-state homicide rates are compared. Many people have argued that right-to-carry laws deter crime, since there are more armed people around to stop a criminal.  That idea was supported by a controversial 1997 analysis, but these newer, more thorough analyses show the opposite effect. That could be because confrontations are more likely to escalate to a shooting, because there are more guns around that can get stolen, or some other factor. But considering the House recently passed a bill that would let people carry weapons across state lines and require states to honor the concealed-carry policies of other states, research about the impact of such policies is more  important than ever. ""The scope and quality of gun-related research is growing, with clear implications for the policy debate,"" Cook and Donohue wrote. In the wake of mass shooting like Sandy Hook and more recently Las Vegas, it's imperative to figure out what policy changes can help save lives.",2017-12-14 00:00:00,A spike in gun sales after the Sandy Hook massacre led to a tragic increase in accidental deaths — especially among kids,"law and legislation,medicine and health,gun control,firearms,children and youth,murders and attempted murders,violence",18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

291,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/01/abc-news-issues-corrects-bombshell-michael-flynn-report.html," ABC News on Friday corrected a stunning news report about Michael Flynn, the former White House official who pleaded guilty to giving a false statement to the FBI, which sparked a feeding frenzy and ricocheted across markets. Flynn, President Donald Trump's former national security advisor, admitted to lying to federal investigators about conversations he held with Sergey I. Kislyak, a Russian diplomat. The former general's plea was part of an ongoing probe into Russia's suspected attempts to influence the 2016 election. Earlier in the day, ABC cited an unnamed source saying Flynn was prepared to testify that he made overtures to the Russian ambassador at Trump's behest, while the heated presidential contest was underway. Yet by Friday evening, the network had backtracked, saying Flynn would likely state that Trump's instructions occurred after the election. That distinction effectively altered the timeline and lessened the significance of the discussions — which according to ABC's report were meant to galvanize U.S.-Russian efforts to fight ISIS in Syria. Via Twitter, ABC initially called the updated story a ""clarification,"" but later formally corrected the piece and deleted its original tweet. ABC tweet By that time, much of the damage had already been done. Multiple media outlets, including CNBC, pounced on the ABC report, which reverberated through markets and stirred speculation that the Trump campaign may have colluded with the Russian government. Vanderhei ABC's handling of the story drew harsh criticism from media critics and defenders of the president. For his part, Donald Trump Jr., blasted the report as ""fake news"" in a Twitter post on Saturday, even as his father refrained from making any immediate comment. ABC retracts their misleading ""bombshell"" and removes their tweet approximately 12 hours after they knew it to be false. I know it's rare for you guys to get more than 200 RTs so I guess you milk it when you can?!?! #fakenews Brian Ross, one of the network's most prominent journalists who first broke the news, was excoriated for his role in the report. Several critics recalled the time that Ross wrongly implicated the Tea Party in a 2012 mass shooting that took place in Aurora, Colorado. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

292,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/510479214/0/milwaukee/home~Year-in-review-stories-from-states-that-moved-us-in/,"The year began with Donald Trump assuming the mantle of 45th president of the United States. The day after he was inaugurated, more than two million people across the world called for a ""revolution"" as a bulwark against the new administration they feared would roll back reproductive, civil and human rights. The year that followed was no less dramatic. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was ousted from the White House over his Russian contacts. NFL players continued to kneel. There were multiple data breaches, but none larger than Equifax, which compromised the personal information of nearly half of all Americans. Inevitably, there was tragedy. The catastrophic 2017 hurricane season brought us Harvey, Irma and Maria, which Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico will spend years recovering from. New York City saw its worst terrorist attack since 9/11. In Las Vegas, 58 people died in the worst mass shooting in American history. But there was also wonder. For the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. We celebrated the news that one of our own, California native Meghan Markle, is set to wed Prince Harry and become the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family. In the end, 2017 closes with hope. Women punctuated the year with the powerful rallying cry #metoo, prompting a national reckoning on a culture of sexual violence that has persisted unabated for far too long. After another eventful year, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state — the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about. Alabama: Roy Moore and America’s reckoning on sexual violence The eyes of a nation were fixed on Alabama this December to see who the state would choose to take over its open Senate seat in an election that was seen not only as a referendum on President Trump — who supported embattled Republican candidate Roy Moore — but also on the country's tolerance of predatory sexual behavior. Trump was elected in spite of more than a dozen allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. But Moore, who was accused in November of sexually assaulting and harassing multiple teenage girls when he was in his 30s, was defeated by Democrat Doug Jones. It is the first time in 25 years that Alabama has elected a Democrat to the Senate. The Alabama special election came during what America has come to refer to as its ""post-Weinstein moment,"" a reckoning on powerful men who have abused women with impunity, and who, until recently, rarely faced consequences. Since the reports Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein harassed, abused and assaulted more than 80 women over several decades, women around the country who have long suffered in silence flooded social media under the hashtag #metoo and made public statements about the sexual misconduct they've endured. For many Americans, this reckoning is complicated by Trump's presence in the White House. Trump's accusers have revived calls for a congressional investigation into his misconduct. Some say Jones’ victory will embolden Democrats to do just that. Alaska: Fear of climate change rises after U.S. leaves Paris Accord In 2017, America became the only country on Earth not part of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Trump decided to leave the pact in June. The Paris agreement, negotiated by former president Barack Obama, aims to combat global warming by gradually reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In Alaska, climate change is always front-of-mind. Many residents of Sarichef Island and an Iñupiaq village of 650 blame human-caused climate change for accelerating the island’s erosion and fear leaving the Paris agreement will supercharge destruction that's already occurring. Arizona: McCain, battling brain cancer, stops Obamacare repeal It was a tense July night on the Senate floor when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. — roughly a week after announcing his brain cancer diagnosis — sunk the GOP-backed ""skinny repeal"" of Obamacare with a dramatic ""thumbs down."" Before the vote, congressional leaders had struggled to reach consensus on a plan to replace former president Barack Obama's signature health care law, which the GOP had promised for seven years to expunge the law from the books. Republicans ultimately scrapped a vote on a last-ditch Obamacare repeal effort in September, which McCain also opposed. As for his health, McCain said in September he would continue treatments for brain cancer while also doing his job on Capitol Hill. Arkansas: Controversial Ten Commandments monument destroyed after less than 24 hours After years of fierce debate, Arkansas built a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol building. Less than 24 hours later, the monument was razed. Michael Tate Reed, 32, plowed his car through the statue while filming the incident on his cellphone and posting the video on Facebook, authorities said. The 6-foot, 6,000-pound memorial drew the ire of opponents like the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Temple of Satan, who said the monument was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. Supporters saw it as a way to celebrate the role the Ten Commandments played in this country’s law. State Sen. Jason Rapert, who led the push to initially erect the monument, vowed to raise funds to build its replacement. California: Meghan Markle, America's fairy-tale royal bride Royal wedding bells are ringing yet again. Suits actress and California native Meghan Markle is set to wed Prince Harry, the world's most eligible royal bachelor. The couple announced their engagement in November. Markle, who was raised in Los Angeles, will make history as the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family. After they wed, Harry will likely receive a new royal title as a duke from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and Markle will, like Duchess Kate, be known as a titled royal duchess, HRH Meghan, Duchess of so-and-so. Also in royals: Prince William and Kate Middleton announced they are expecting their third child. Sister Pippa Middleton's May wedding was the A-list event of the year. Colorado: Baker's confections vs. gay couple's affections In 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins went into baker Jack Phillips' Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colo., to buy a cake for their wedding. But Phillips doesn't do cakes for same-sex weddings. Craig and Mullins said Phillips' refusal violated a Colorado anti-discrimination law. Five years later, their disagreement over a cake went all the way to the Supreme Court in a case testing the Constitution's guarantee of free speech and religion against state laws prohibiting discrimination. The court, bolstered in April by the addition of stalwart conservative and fellow Coloradan Neil Gorsuch, appeared split down the middle when the justices heard oral arguments Dec. 5. The decision, which will likely hinge on Justice Anthony Kennedy, isn't expected until next year. Connecticut: Hate crime, or roommate feud gone too far? In late October, former University of Hartford student Briana Brochu was charged with breach of peace and criminal mischief for tampering with items that belonged to her roommate, who is black. Brochu admitted she licked Chennel ""Jazzy"" Rowe's eating utensils and smeared bodily fluids on her backpack. Rowe posted a Facebook video about the incident, which quickly viral, and prompted backlash on social media as many questioned whether Brochu's actions were racially motivated. The Connecticut NAACP and others called on Hartford prosecutors to file a hate crime charge against Brochu, but Brochu's lawyer, Thomas Stevens, told the Hartford Courant he does not believe the charge will be added. Stevens told the paper there was nothing ""racial that motivated"" the incident, and said they were simply roommates who did not get along. Delaware: Beau's death convinced Joe Biden not to run for president Had he run for president, Joe Biden believes he would have taken the oath of office Jan. 20 rather than the train home to Wilmington. The former vice president and Delaware senator, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom days before leaving office, revealed in his emotional book that he originally considered staying out of the 2016 race to pave the way for his son Beau's budding political career, and Beau’s death following a brutal bout with cancer ultimately convinced him it wasn’t the time to make the run. So what about a 2020 push? He hasn’t ruled it out quite yet. Florida: Irma devastates the Gulf coast Hurricane Irma sawed up Florida's Gulf coast in early September, the strongest hurricane the Sunshine State had faced in a decade. Its slow crawl toward Florida caused a run on hardware store and grocery essentials, while evacuation orders threw the state's highways into a standstill. After it pummeled Key West, the storm struck the Naples area, taking down trees and causing flooding across the state. All told, millions lost power and dozens died, including 14 people at a Hollywood nursing home, where a power outage left residents in sweltering conditions for three days. It sparked a criminal investigation in which 12 of the deaths were deemed homicides. Now, state lawmakers seek laws requiring assisted living facilities to have generators. Georgia: Equifax data breach leaves millions of consumers vulnerable Atlanta-based company Equifax, once trusted to handle our credit scores, has become a pariah of the financial world since hackers stole the vital information of 145 million Americans in Equifax’s system. The breach announced this September included Social Security numbers, names, addresses and dates of birth. How did Equifax get into the mess? A security patch for a known system bug was issued but Equifax hadn’t installed it. Lawmakers asked questions, the CEO resigned, and a good chunk of America freaked out. One way consumers tried to protect themselves was by freezing their credit, but since everyone tried to do it at once, there were problems. Here's how to protect yourself from a breach. Hawaii: Trump travel ban found trouble in paradise The Aloha State was not a welcoming place for President Trump's plans to ban travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. The administration issued three versions of the ban in 2017 and all three were blocked by a federal judge in Hawaii. But despite the Hawaii bench’s best efforts to thwart the ban, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this month that Trump’s order can take full effect while legal challenges against the latest version are still tied up in courts. By allowing the full travel ban to take effect for now, the justices may be signaling that they are likely to uphold it on the merits at a later date. Idaho: Bergdahl avoids jail time for disappearing from Afghanistan base Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army soldier who disappeared from his base in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, avoided jail time despite pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior in front of the enemy. Former president Barack Obama won freedom for the Idaho native in 2014 by negotiating a prisoner swap with the Taliban militants. His case even became the subject of the second season of the podcast Serial. Bergdahl faced a life sentence for abandoning his post, but a military judge ruled to reduce him in rank to private and dishonorably discharge him. President Trump slammed the decision in a tweet, calling it, ""a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military."" Illinois: Conspiracy, obstruction charges in Laquan McDonald killing The dash cam footage was chilling. Sixteen shots fired at Laquan McDonald as the 17-year-old walked away from police. Now prosecutors say three Chicago police officers were trying to ""conceal the true facts"" in McDonald's death. A Cook County grand jury indicted the officers in June with state charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and misconduct. ""These defendants did more than merely obey an unofficial 'code of silence,'"" special prosecutor Patricia Brown Holmes said of the alleged coverup. Officer Jason Van Dyke previously pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trail on first-degree murder charges. Indiana: A canceled wedding, but love prevails When an Indiana couple called off their $30,000 wedding a week before the big day, they were stuck with a non-refundable reception. What did would-be bride Sarah Cummins do? She invited guests from four area homeless shelters. Her generosity inspired a local man to donate suits for guests, his tailor donated a few more and another local business contributed dresses and accessories. The July dinner, which included chicken, salmon, wedding cake and even a late-night snack of pizza, turned a painful situation positive, Cummins said. She now volunteers for a center for homeless families in Indianapolis. Iowa: A giant wave connects sick kids to the outside world The new children's hospital practically hangs over the University of Iowa's Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City. Before the season kicked off, a fan named Krista Young had an idea: ""Kinnick should hold a 'wave to the kids' minute during every game."" The Facebook post went viral and on Sept. 2, when the Hawkeyes' football team hosted the Wyoming Cowboys, 68,000-plus fans rose, turned to the hospital and offered a long, sustained wave to sick children — some of whom haven't left in months — gathered near the windows to watch the game. Kristen Brown, a nurse at the Stead Family Children's Hospital, said the now-regular waves connect kids to the outside world. ""Anytime we can make them feel normal and a part of something, it's very meaningful,"" she said. Kansas: Principal resigns after student newspaper questions her credentials A team of high school journalism students in Kansas published an investigative story questioning their incoming principal's qualifications. And then she resigned. The student reporters received national recognition after they revealed that Amy Robertson, their would-be new principal, received her master's and doctoral degrees from Corllins University, an unaccredited online school. Robertson, who currently works with an education consulting firm in Dubai, said she received her degrees before the university lost accreditation. The Pittsburg School Board accepted Robertson's resignation in April. Kentucky: Passenger's removal from United flight sparks uproar On April 9, Kentucky doctor David Dao was shown on video being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville. Dao was among four passengers scheduled to be removed to accommodate crew members. The footage of Dao screaming as he was pulled from the plane went viral. Days later, Dao's lawyer said he suffered a concussion and broken nose. The incident prompted United to make changes to its passenger policies. Two security officers involved in the incident were fired. Louisiana: 'I'm back': Steve Scalise returns to Congress after shooting With two words, ""I'm back,"" Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise tweeted his remarkable return to the U.S. Capitol after a gunman critically wounded him during a congressional baseball team practice on June 14 outside Washington, D.C. Four others were shot before the gunman was killed. Scalise was discharged from the hospital six weeks later to begin a process of intensive rehabilitation. On September 28, Scalise got back to work, tweeting a photo of him and his wife Jennifer looking out at the National Mall from the Capitol. His return to the House floor was met by a standing ovation. ""You have no idea how great this feels to be back here at work in the people's House."" Maine: Thousands send Christmas cards to dying boy Jacob Thompson just wanted to celebrate one more Christmas. The 9-year-old from Maine, who had been diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma in February 2014, made a simple request when he was admitted to the hospital in October and was told he had only a month to live: Send Christmas cards. Tens of thousands of cards flew into Jacob's small hospital room as the boy's story captured the hearts of people across the nation. Having a love for penguins, he even got a special visit when the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut brought the tuxedo birds to meet their young fan. Thompson died Nov. 19. Maryland: The day the NFL took a knee NFL players responded in full force on a Sunday in September after President Trump repeatedly called for punishing players who didn’t stand during the national anthem. In the first game that day, a number of teammates from the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars either knelt or locked arms at a high-profile game in London. Landover, Md.-based Washington Redskins players stood with arms locked, though some players chose to kneel. And across the league demonstrations spread, as many players broke out of their routine by joining the protests or engaging in team-wide displays of unity. The protests first began in the 2016 season, when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick said it was his way of speaking out against racial injustice and police brutality. Massachusetts: Michelle Carter gets 15 months in prison for texting boyfriend to commit suicide ""You can't think about it. You just have to do it. You said you were gonna do it."" Michelle Carter, 20, sent dozens of texts like this encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy III, 18, to commit suicide, which Roy eventually did after Carter instructed him to get back in a truck filling with carbon monoxide. Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, of which she'll serve 15 months. The case was the first to determine the legality of telling someone to commit suicide. Legal experts are concerned that it could set a bad legal precedent. Michigan: '90s grunge lost an icon in Chris Cornell Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell's distinctive, nearly four-octave wail was nearly synonymous with the grunge-music era of the 1990s. Just hours after performing for a Detroit crowd in May, the 52-year-old was found unresponsive in his hotel room. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office ruled the death a suicide by hanging, although his family questioned the findings. Cornell was just one among many celebrities we lost this year. Minnesota: #MeToo movement hits Minnesota hard Democratic Senator Al Franken announced his resignation in December after more than a half dozen women said he touched them improperly or made unwanted sexual advances. Franken disputed some accusations and suggested he was being held to a different standard than President Trump. Franken became the second member of Congress to announce his resignation due to sexual harassment allegations in 2017. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a civil rights icon first elected to the House in 1964, stepped down after several women accused him of harassment. Franken's fellow Minnesotan Garrison Keillor, the iconic Prairie Home Companion host, was fired in November after allegations of ""inappropriate behavior."" Mississippi: Bringing 'insane asylum' dead back to life Up to 7,000 dead bodies are buried underneath the University of Mississippi Medical Center campus. They are former patients of the state's first mental institution, called simply the Insane Asylum, built in 1855. Underground radar shows the coffins stretch across 20 acres of the campus. UMMC discovered 66 coffins while doing construction on the campus in 2013, but has since detected thousands more. UMMC is now teaming up with a professor from Millsaps College in Jackson for a possible National Endowment of Humanities grant that would fund a study of the asylum and its history as well as engage families whose ancestors lived there. The center is looking at exhuming the bodies, and preserving as well as studying the remains. Missouri: Girl mistakes elk for deer, shoots it dead, story goes viral Abby Wilson, 14, was hunting alone when she said she spotted a very large white-tailed deer and pulled the trigger. The problem? It wasn't a deer. It was an elk. Her father, Donald White, immediately called the conservation department upon realizing his daughter's mistake. Because there's no elk hunting season in Missouri, the animals are protected and wildlife officials are determining whether to issue any citations or warnings to the young hunter. After the story went viral, White said comments directed at her, including that she should be locked up, amounted to bullying. Montana: Body slam shows just one of many threats facing journalists The first year of the Trump era was a tough one for American journalists. On top of competing with ""alternative facts"" and being labeled the ""enemy of the American people"" by the president, some reporters were physically stopped from doing their jobs. In May, wealthy businessman Greg Gianforte, who was running for Montana's open House seat, was arrested for assaulting Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on the eve of the election. Gianforte won over Montana voters but apparently lied to investigators after the body slam. Nebraska: Sasse sasses Trump It's no secret that Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse took his fair share of jabs at President Trump this year. The young Republican from Plainview recently asked the president if he was ""recanting"" his oath of office following an apparent threat of the freedom of the press. He also called out Trump for his Twitter attack on the hosts of MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" saying ""it's beneath the dignity of your office."" Sasse's and other GOP legislators', well, sass, highlights Trump's struggle to make nice with Republicans on Capitol Hill. Nevada: Deadliest year for mass killings in more than a decade On Oct. 1, America changed forever when a gunman shattered his hotel windows at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas and opened fire on 22,000 country music fans at the outdoor Route 91 Harvest Festival. Fifty-eight would die in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Nearly 500 were injured. The gunman's motive remains a mystery. A wounded country came together again in November when a gunman killed 25 people, including a pregnant woman whose unborn baby also died, during a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas. With that, 2017 earned a bitter honor of being the most deadly year for mass killings in the U.S. in more than a decade. Three of the five largest mass killings — in Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. — have taken place since June 2016. New Hampshire: Voter fraud or bogus claims? Following the 2016 election, President Trump called for a crackdown on voter fraud. Trump claimed he lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused to New Hampshire to cast illegal votes against him. The solution? A voter fraud election commission was set up to investigate the matter. To date, legal experts and the New Hampshire deputy secretary of state said there is no evidence of voter fraud and the commission itself seems to have gone dark in recent weeks, with the last meeting held Sept. 12 in the Granite State. New Jersey: Chris Christie feels the heat over 'beachgate' Just before the Fourth of July, Governor Chris Christie was spotted lounging outside his residence on Island Beach State Park. The only problem? He'd just closed that beach to the public — and all the other state parks in New Jersey — thanks to a state government shutdown. The photo became the source of endless memes, and New Jersey residents told the governor to ""get the hell off the beach!"" A few weeks before ""beachgate,"" a poll found Christie's approval ratings had sunk to 15%, making him the least popular governor in any state in the past 20 years. After legislators struck a deal in ending the three day shutdown in time for the holiday, Christie announced he was headed right back to the beach. New Mexico: Plague found, and this isn't the first time The plague, once called the Black Death, wiped out nearly half of the European population in the Middle Ages. And while it sounds like a disease that should have no place in modern times, each spring and summer cases pop up, often in Western areas. In late June, New Mexico confirmed a total of three cases of the plague in Santa Fe County. According to the New Mexico Department of Health, all three were hospitalized and later released. So, how does one get the plague? It’s typically transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, and while terrifying sounding, it can be treated if the symptoms are recognized early. New York: Terror in NYC It was New York City's worst terrorist attack since 9/11, and occurred just a few blocks away from where the iconic twin towers crumbled. This November, Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan with ties to the Islamic State, ran down cyclists and pedestrians on a busy bike path before crashing into a school bus, killing 8 people and injuring 12. Saipov's killings occurred mere hours before the city's annual Halloween parade was to kick off, but revelers were undeterred. Amid heavier police presence, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio joined a million people who marched and danced down 6th Avenue in defiance of terror. De Blasio said, ""What New Yorkers showed already is we will not change, we will not be cowed, we will not be thrown off by anything."" North Carolina: Gerrymandering case struck down case, but what’s next? The United States Supreme Court in June struck down dozens of state legislative districts in North Carolina because they disadvantaged black voters. Then, federal judges rejected a request by North Carolina voters to hold special elections next March in new districts once lines are redrawn to eliminate illegal racial gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the deliberate process of redrawing lines to sway electoral outcomes in favor of a certain political party. As Karl Rove once said: ""He who controls redistricting can control Congress."" The issue has also been disputed in other states across the USA this year, particularly Wisconsin, which has a gerrymandering case before the Supreme Court with far-reaching national implications. North Dakota: Dakota Access Pipeline flows amid controversy After months of protests from environmental groups and Native American activists, the Army said it would allow the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota, completing the disputed project. The 1,200-mile pipeline began transporting crude oil on June 1 from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution hub in Illinois. Activists renewed calls to shut it down after a federal judge ruled the Army Corps of Engineers complied with some, but not all, requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act before issuing a permit. The developer of the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, has since filed a $1 billion federal lawsuit against several environmental groups accusing them of fraud, eco-terrorism and participation in a criminal enterprise. Ohio: Otto Warmbier's death, and a year of high-stakes tension with North Korea The death of Ohio native Otto Warmbier was a heartbreaking moment in a year of marked tensions with North Korea. Warmbier, a college student at the University of Virginia, was arrested in North Korea on charges of trying to steal a poster. The 22-year-old was returned home in June in a coma; he died shortly thereafter. Pyongyang denied it tortured or mistreated him, claiming Warmbier contracted botulism and was given a sleeping pill. Throughout 2017, President Trump and Kim Jong Un, whom Trump dubbed ""Little Rocket Man,"" exchanged ever more heated threats over North Korea's rapid development of nuclear weapons that could strike the U.S. mainland. Oklahoma: Another blow to Black Lives Matter ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" became a rallying cry after Michael Brown was killed in 2014 in Ferguson, Mo. Terence Crutcher had his hands up. Police shot. In May, a jury acquitted of first-degree manslaughter white Tulsa officer Betty Jo Shelby, who says she fired out of fear last year when she killed 40-year-old Crutcher. His family burst into tears at the verdict. In a video of the incident, the Tulsa Police Department can be heard saying Crutcher ""looks like a bad dude."" Crutcher's twin sister later said, ""That 'big bad dude' was a father ... a son."" The controversial verdict led to protests from Black Lives Matter. Shelby has since resigned from the Tulsa Police Department. Oregon: The Great American Eclipse captivates a nation For the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. Americans paused and enjoyed some unity as the moon passed between the sun and the Earth. Many traveled to the path of totality to experience the eerie darkness. From coast to coast, Americans watched — hopefully while wearing eclipse glasses — as the moon's shadow traced its 67-mile wide path across the country starting in Oregon. Those 2-3 minutes of darkness brought millions of tourist dollars to hotels, campgrounds, restaurants and museums in cities in the eclipse path. Pennsylvania: They gave him 18 drinks. Then, left him to die The horrifying death of a 19-year-old fraternity pledge captured on video exposed dangerous hazing rituals by members of Penn State University's Beta Theta Pi. After frat brothers gave Timothy Piazza 18 drinks in less than one hour and 22 minutes, his blood-alcohol content was about four times the legal limit for driving. Piazza was found unconscious in the basement the next day and later died. At least two dozen face charges in the case. Three other pledges across the nation died this year in Greek-related drinking incidents. Rhode Island: Michael Flynn, and the role of Russia in the 2016 election Despite being one of the most vulnerable figures in special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn remained beloved in his Rhode Island hometown in 2017. Flynn was ousted from the White House just weeks after President Trump's inauguration over his Russian contacts, and in December, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn is among four campaign aides charged so far in Mueller's investigation. Flynn is the only one who served in Trump's administration. The only other guilty plea is George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign associate Rick Gates have been charged and pleaded not guilty. In addition to Mueller's investigation, three Congressional committees are looking at Russia. South Carolina: Governor stands by Trump amid sanctuary city crackdown South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made it clear in October that the Palmetto State would not tolerate any cities acting as sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. The governor's strong condemnation of sanctuary cities came months after President Trump's executive order cracking down on cities that limit cooperation with immigration agencies. Following the order, leaders of some of the nation's biggest cities, including New York City, Chicago, and Boston, flatly stated they would not cooperate with the president. In November, a federal judge permanently blocked Trump's executive order on sanctuary cities. South Dakota: Old gold mine might hold treasured info on why we exist Researchers are in search of a different kind of treasure in a rural South Dakota gold mine: potential secrets explaining how the universe was created. The mine in Lead, S.D., that once hosted gold rushes in the 1800s will serve as home to scientists participating in the largest U.S.-based particle physics experiment. The experiment will determine whether particles called neutrinos help explain our existence. Over the next 10 years, workers will remove more than 870,000 tons of rock and install a four-story, 70,000-ton neutrino detector. The collaboration will involve 1,000 scientists from more than 30 countries. Tennessee: Tuition-free community college Tennessee students can put away their checkbooks if community colleges are in their future. In May, the southern state became the first to offer a tuition-free education to nearly every resident without a degree. Even though Tennessee was the first state to pass the measure, it isn't without precursors. New York legislators passed a budget in April that covered tuition for families making less than $100,000 a year. In February, San Francisco voters passed a tax measure that would cover community college tuition for anyone who lived in the city for more than a year, though the state of California did not follow suit. Texas: Hurricane Harvey hit hard Hurricane Harvey's historic downpour brought destruction to the Texas Gulf coast. Harvey killed dozens, dumped more than 50 inches of rain and drove thousands from their homes. Its effects will be felt for months and years into the future. Amid the destruction, people stepped up to help. There was Houston Texans star J.J. Watt raising more than $37 million in online donations, human chains pulling people to safety and an impromptu gospel singing performance at a shelter. Watt perhaps put it best: ""When times are the toughest, humanity stands at its strongest."" Utah: Outcry over nurse's arrest for refusing to draw unconscious patient's blood A Utah police officer was fired after he arrested a nurse who refused to let him draw blood from an unconscious patient without a warrant. Body cam footage of the arrest shows Detective Jeff Payne dragging Alex Wubbels from University Hospital while she sobs ""this is crazy."" An investigation was opened after video of the arrest went viral, and Wubbels received a $500,000 settlement from the city and the university that runs the hospital. She said she would give a portion of the settlement to the nurses union and help lead a campaign to stop physical and verbal abuse of nurses on the job. Vermont: This 13-year-old wants to be governor Ethan Sonneborn, 13, has some lofty political ambitions. The young Democrat announced this summer that he's running for governor in 2018, and with Vermont's founders imposing no age requirement for its highest office, his path to power is a little easier. The Bristol resident follows the news closely, chooses his words deliberately and sees his age as an asset, not a liability. ""We elected our oldest president ever,"" Sonneborn said, ""and he tweets like a kindergartner."" His views on the president echo those of prominent Vermont progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told USA TODAY one year after the election that Trump's presidency is an ""unprecedented disaster."" A hot topic Sonneborn would have to address if elected: recreational marijuana. Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a legalization bill in May, a decision with which Sonneborn took issue. Virginia: White supremacy in Charlottesville It's 2017, and there were neo-Nazis in the streets. In August, hundreds of white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis descended upon Charlottesville, Va., for a ""Unite the Right"" rally to protest the removal of a Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally turned violent when James Alex Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, who had expressed support for neo-Nazi positions, drove his car at high speed into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. President Trump was reticent to condemn the white supremacists, saying ""many sides"" were to blame for the violence. After his comments, Heyer's mother said she wouldn't take phone calls from the president. The rally was headlined by far-right white nationalist Richard Spencer, who returned to the city for another protest in October. Here's why Charlottesville has become ground zero for white supremacists. Washington: Amazon's new dome home Amazon joined Apple and Google in the race to build futuristic tech headquarters, introducing the Spheres, three (you guessed it) spheres that will ""round"" out the Seattle cityscape. The tallest of the glass and metal orbs rises 90 feet and is more than 130 feet in diameter, with two smaller spheres on each side. The space will host up to 800 employees for potential meetings, meals and mingling. It will also feature plenty of plant life, along with tree-house meeting rooms, a river and waterfalls, and a green ""bird's nest"" conference room. The rest of the public can visit through shops located near the entrance or by signing up for tours once it opens next year. West Virginia: Coal country digs Trump West Virginia, once a Democratic stronghold, is now Trump country. West Virginia’s conservative shift has been so pronounced that Gov. Jim Justice changed his political stripes in August and flipped from Democrat to Republican after just seven months in office. The state hasn't gone Democrat in a presidential election since 1996, and Hillary Clinton lost there by more than 40%. President Trump, who promised to bring coal mining jobs back, also got 77% of the vote in the Republican primary there. Trump took a lot of heat for politicizing the Boy Scout Jamboree held in West Virginia in July (prompting an apology from the Boy Scouts) but he was right back in the state the following week to rally the base and tout an end to ""war on beautiful clean coal."" Wisconsin: Blacked-out vacationers suspect tainted booze Abbey Conner went on a family vacation to an all-inclusive Mexican resort in January, but shortly after arriving, she was found face down in the pool, brain dead. Connor's death days later sparked a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that found 100-plus people saying they blacked out from moderate to light drinking at Mexican resorts. Some were robbed. Others were raped. Few ever found justice. The State Department issued an alert about possibly tainted or counterfeit alcohol. Mexican officials swept tourist spots and claimed to seize 10,000 gallons of illegal booze from a shoddy distributer. They reported no such evidence at the resort where Connor drowned. Wyoming: Trump national parks moves met with backlash This year may have been your last chance to visit Yellowstone without doling out $70 to do so. The Trump administration in October proposed a price increase for the Wyoming landmark and 16 other national parks. Trump also faced criticism — and legal action — for his decision to shrink federally protected land by about two million acres in Bear Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah earlier this month. In April, Trump signed an executive order to review more than a dozen national monuments across the USA. Washington, D.C.: Nation's capital becomes epicenter of the #resistance Home to the most massive manifestations of opposition to the Trump agenda in a year that saw #resistance protests and marches against the administration across the country, Washington, D.C., became a hotbed for public demonstrations countering the president. The Women's March on Washington was the first and fiercest, coming the day after Trump's inauguration (which did NOT draw the biggest crowd to the National Mall in history, despite some claims to the contrary) and drawing an estimated 500,000 people angered at a president accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct. Huge crowds also gathered for the March for Science, the People's Climate March and the March for Truth. Forgot about September's pro-Trump, Mother of All Rallies? It's understandable. Only a thousand folks turned out and it was held the same day as the historic Juggalo March. Puerto Rico: Maria devastates Puerto Rico, fueling feud with Trump Hurricane Maria pounded Puerto Rico in late September, causing unprecedented devastation to the island of 3.4 million people. The storm knocked out the majority of Puerto Rico's power and sparked a feud between the island and President Trump. For those unclear, Puerto Rico is indeed part of the United States — it's a commonwealth — and yes, its residents are U.S. citizens. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz took shots at Trump for the government's response to Maria, which she called ""inadequate."" Trump publicly bashed Cruz, saying she had ""poor leadership ability."" Months after the storm, large parts of the island remained without power, prompting Washington to seek efforts to modernize Puerto Rico's power grid. Guam: Priest sex abuse cases shatter faith on Guam The predominantly Catholic island of Guam was rocked when a Pacific Daily News investigation unearthed decades of sexual assault, manipulation and intimidation against children reared on the remote U.S. territory by some of its most revered men, the Catholic clergy. At least 143 cases of child sexual abuse have been reported against Catholic priests tied to Guam. Of those cases, 87 involve a single former priest and scoutmaster, Louis Brouillard, who allegedly committed horrendous sexual crimes against children, including accounts of rape, drugging and even tying up a boy before forced sex acts. Also among the accusations: a boy fondled on the way to his grandmother's burial, and another molested for the first time on his seventh birthday, then raped or assaulted 100 more times. U.S. Virgin Islands: Ravaged by back-to-back hurricanes Before Hurricanes Irma and Maria made their way to Florida and Puerto Rico, they tore through the U.S. Virgin Islands, a cluster of American islands in the Caribbean. Weeks after the back-to-back September storms, Virgin Islanders – who are Americans by birth – were in the grips of a long and painful recovery. Thousands went without power, and telephone and internet coverage remained spotty. Many fled – perhaps never to return. When USA TODAY reporter Fredreka Schouten returned home, she found family and friends' houses torn apart, and her former school with windows blown out and metal littered about. The destruction brought back memories of past devastating storms – Hugo in 1989 and Marilyn in 1995. This is a compilation of stories from across USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network.

294,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aztec-high-school-gunman-posed-as-student-thumb-drive-may-reveal-motive-officials/,"Watch CBSN Live  December 8, 2017 / 2:56 PM
          / CBS/AP AZTEC, N.M. -- Authorities say a 21-year-old gunman killed two students at a New Mexico high school Thursday in a planned attack after disguising himself as a student to gain access to the building.San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen told reporters Friday that 21-year-old William Atchison of the small town of Aztec had legally purchased a 9mm Glock pistol a month ago. Officials said Atchison, who had previously attended Aztec High School, went there before buses arrived and was able to ""mingle"" with students and walk into the building undetected. Atchison killed the two students apparently at random, one in a restroom and the other just outside, Christesen said. Authorities confirmed Friday they do not believe the gunman targeted Casey Jordan-Marquez and Francisco ""Paco"" Fernandez. More lives could have been lost had Fernandez not walked into the bathroom, authorities said. That's when the gunman shot Fernandez. Atchison walked out into the hallway and encountered the second victim, Casey J. Marquez, and killed her. After shooting both dead, he went on a rampage within the school, walking up and down the hallway and shooting through glass and walls as students and teachers barricaded themselves. Then, he fatally shot himself with the same gun. ""This person is not only a coward, he's evil in my mind,"" Christesen said. Christesen said writings found on a thumb drive show that the 21-year-old had planned the attack and carried it out with an intent that was ""focused"" and ""deranged."" Christesen displayed some of the writings at a press conference Friday. ""If things go according to plan, today would be when I die,"" the writings said. ""I wait until the school buses are detected, then head out on foot disguised as a student. I go somewhere and gear up, then hold a class hostage and go apes----, then blow my brains out."" In the writings, Atchinson spoke of being unhappy with work, school and his life and said, ""I just want out of this s---."" Officials said they were still baffled as to a motive but they believe further information on the thumb drive, which has been turned over to the FBI, will help authorities understand what led up to the shooting. New Mexico State Police chief Pete Kassetas said it was ""very obvious"" Atchison wanted officials to find the thumb drive because it was on his body. ""There's a lot more information there, we've barely scratched the surface of that, of what was speaking to his mindframe,"" Kassetas said. Investigators also found a timeline of what the gunman had planned, with a final time-stamped note that said, ""Die."" Speaking Friday, an FBI agent said Atchison had previous been investigated by the FBI after making comments on an online gaming forum about buying ""cheap assault rifles"" for someone who wanted to commit a mass shooting. Terry Wade, FBI special agent in charge in Albuquerque, said that the agency checked databases and interviewed him and his family in March 2016. Wade said the man didn't have a gun at that time and told agents that he had no plans for an attack. He also didn't have ties to any organizations. Family members said Atchison was known for making comments to get people ""riled up,"" Christesen said, and Wade said Atchison admitted he liked to ""troll"" online. The FBI closed the investigation when it determined no crime was committed. Christesen hailed brave acts of school staff and law enforcement who he said helped save lives. He told reporters Friday that a substitute teacher heard the gunshots but didn't have a key to lock the door to the computer lab, so she took students into an office or storage area and barricaded the door with a couch. He said Atchison came to the room and yelled that he knew they were in there and then fired multiple shots into the room. Christesen and other officials praised the bravery of school staff and law enforcement who arrived at the scene in less than a minute, which he said prevented more bloodshed. Christesen also hailed a brave custodian who he said pursued the gunman and yelled to alert teachers there was an active shooter and to lock down. Christesen said it was a ""miracle"" no other injuries were reported. The shooting has rocked Aztec, a community of about 6,500 near the Colorado border. Hundreds gathered for prayer services and candlelight vigils to honor the victims and more gatherings are planned over the weekend as residents look for answers. Marquez was a cheerleader and was planning to participate in the upcoming Orange Bowl. Her classmates said she came across as a student leader. Bryn Divine, a senior at Aztec High School, remembered the victim being a vibrant and friendly student who often won dance contests at school events. ""She lit up pretty much any room we were all in,"" Divine said. ""She was such a fun person to be around."" Fernandez was known for his speedy typing and interest in computers. His family has said he had a bright future ahead of him. Gov. Susana Martinez said she has met with the teens' families and they talked about what great kids they were. Both of them also had jobs. Martinez said the families are broken but are pulling together. ""I don't think anyone ever gets over this,"" she said. First published on December 8, 2017 / 2:56 PM © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Deputy Zackari Parrish, 29, (left) was killed after Matthew Riehl, 37, (right) fired more than 100 rounds from his apartment. The rifle-toting man who gunned down a Colorado deputy in a New Year’s Eve “ambush-style” attack had ranted about the sheriff and a local police officer in recent online posts discovered after the assault. Matthew Riehl, 37, fired more than 100 rounds as he was holed up in a bedroom in his apartment in Highlands Ranch, before he too was found dead at the scene. The Douglas County Sheriff's office identified Riehl as the gunman Sunday evening. Three other deputies, a police officer and two civilians were also wounded. The deputies and the officer had gone to the apartment around 5:15 a.m. in response to a disturbance, Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said. They had been to the apartment about an hour earlier. “They all went down, almost within seconds of each other,” Spurlock said. The Douglas County Sheriff's Office says five deputies were shot at an apartment community in Highlands Ranch, Colo.
      (Fox 31 Denver) He said the deceased deputy was 29-year-old Zackari Parrish. He had been a deputy for seven months. “I can’t tell you how difficult it is for a leader to sit down with a spouse of an officer who was killed in the line of duty,” Spurlock said. “They had many hopes and dreams. He was doing his job and he was doing his job well.” Parrish is survived by his wife and two children and previously worked for two years at the Castle Rock Police Department. Riehl, who was killed, was an Army veteran who served briefly in Iraq, Fox 31 Denver reported. He is seen wearing an Iraq combat veteran hat in a Dec. 13 YouTube video in which he called Spurlock a “clown” and a deputy a pimp. “You know who’s going flub big time next election, Spurlock,” Riehl said in the video called “Fire Sheriff Spurlock.” He said he was running against Spurlock as a libertarian. A video posted on Nov. 28 showed a traffic stop by a police officer in the city of Lone Tree — apparently taken inside the officer's car — that Riehl said was done illegally. He claimed the officer clocked the wrong driver, identifying the officer by name in the video and calling him ""dirty."" ""S---bag, dirtbag, liar,"" he says as the officer questioned the driver. ""He's the boss, huh? He's the Nazi in charge with the stripes on his shoulder and the fake badge."" The wounded officers: Deputies Mike Doyle, 28; Taylor Davis, 30; and Jeffrey Pelle, 32; and Castle Rock police officer Tom O’Donnell, 41, were said to be in stable condition. The civilians had suffered non-life threatening injuries, Spurlock said. Pelle is the son of Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle, Fox 31 Denver reported. Authorities had been to Riehl's home earlier in response to a complaint of a ""verbal disturbance"" involving two men, the sheriff's office said. One of the men told them the suspect ""was acting bizarre and might be having a mental breakdown"" but the deputies found no evidence of a crime. When deputies were called back, a man who had left came by to give them a key and granted permission to enter the home, leaving again before shots were fired. ""The suspect was just making a ton of noise and annoying everyone around him,"" Spurlock said. Four officers, including Parrish, were shot from a bedroom around 6 a.m., forcing the retreat. A SWAT team entered the apartment at about 7:30 a.m. in an exchange of gunfire that left the gunman dead and another officer injured. Local media reported gunshots being heard amid a stream of firetrucks and emergency vehicles entering the area. Steven Silknitter, who lives in the complex, told the Denver Post that he was working elsewhere when he got word of the shooting and called home to speak to his fiance. “She was pretty scared,” Silknitter said. “She kept saying how loud it was.” President Donald Trump tweeted that he has offered his “deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting.” Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper also issued a statement saying “our thoughts and prayers” were with the Douglas County Sheriff's Office and the family and friends of Deputy Parrish. ""We can only imagine the depth of grief they are experiencing,” he said. ""We also hope for a speedy recovery for the Douglas County deputies and the Castle Rock police officer injured in the incident, as well as the residents who also were affected. He added, ""The call to protect and serve too often leads to this ultimate sacrifice. We are grateful for the service of Deputy Parrish, his fellow deputies, and that of the Castle Rock police officer.  We pray for their and their families' strength and resolve in the days and months ahead.""

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Stephen Paddock killed 58 people in deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Lawyers for some of the Las Vegas shooting victims appeared in court on Thursday to help determine how to control the $5 million estate gunman Stephen Paddock left behind, KSNV reported. In the court hearing, Judge Gloria Sturman asked the victim’s attorneys to help create a plan to regulate claims on the property, the outlet said. She reportedly feared that due to the volume of potential people laying claim to the property, the estate could be reduced to nothing because of costs related to claim lawsuits. LAS VEGAS MASSACRE SEARCH WARRANTS REVEAL MASSIVE SCALE OF INVESTIGATION “What we wanted is time for all of the lawyers on behalf of the victims to get together to see if we can come up with an alternative mechanism to preserve the assets for the victims,” attorney Craig Eiland said. Attorneys are expected to have a plan ready by Jan. 31, 2018 and the judge will choose a manager on Feb. 15, 2018, KSNV reported. Paddock killed himself on Oct. 1 after he fired a steady stream of bullets into a crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. More than 1,100 rounds were fired, ultimately killing 58 people and injuring more than 500 others. LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIM LEAVES HOSPITAL, RETURNS HOME FOR HOLIDAYS Following his death, family members said Paddock did not leave a will, according to KSNV. And since none of them reportedly want his money, the outlet said they’ve suggested it should be handed out to the victims. In October, the court system was tasked with tapping an independent entity to run Paddock’s estate, an earlier report by KSNV said.

297,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/congress-to-vote-on-trump--and-nra-backed-bill-to-remove-local-gun-restrictions?CMP=twt_gu,"Ex-congresswoman Gabby Giffords attacks the bill, which passed by 231 to 197 and removes states’ power to control who can carry concealed, loaded handguns First published on Wed 6 Dec 2017 14.10 GMT On the day of an annual vigil in Washington DC that honors the victims of American gun violence, congressional Republicans passed a Trump-endorsed bill that would eviscerate local gun restrictions, removing states’ power to control who is allowed to carry a concealed, loaded handgun in their streets. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a margin of 231-197. Fourteen Republicans voted against while six Democrats voted for it.  Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in a 2011 mass shooting, called the vote “unthinkable”. “The House of Representatives passed a bill that would let almost anyone carry loaded, concealed firearms almost anywhere in the United States,” Giffords said in an email to gun control supporters. Officials in New York and Los Angeles warn that the legislation would allow an unknown numbers of tourists – perhaps hundreds of thousands each year – to carry concealed handguns into America’s densest urban areas, including Times Square and the New York City subway. Big city police chiefs across the county have spoken out against the bill, calling it a law enforcement nightmare. The bill, which is the National Rifle Association’s “number one legislative priority” has prompted a renewed battle over states’ rights, with Democrats for once arguing against the power of the federal government, and Republicans hoping to use that federal power to undermine local control. “It’s so transparently hypocritical. Republicans spend all day talking about states’ rights, except when it comes to guns. When it comes to guns, they want to take away states’ ability to make decisions for themselves,” Senator Chris Murphy, a leading gun control advocate who represents Newtown, Connecticut, said on Tuesday, in advance of the vote. The NRA called the vote a “watershed moment”, one more step in what the group’s chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, described as a “30-year movement” to ensure that Americans can carry their self-defense weapons across state lines. Despite an easy victory in the House, the bill faces a much more uphill battle in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to pass. “Right now, there’s no indication that the Senate Republicans want to take this legislation up. In fact, the opposite,” Murphy said. “My suspicion is there are not 60 votes for a national concealed weapons bill [in the Senate],” he said. Americans have a constitutional right to own guns in their home for self-defense. But America's 50 states have dramatically different laws when it comes to carrying guns in public, which all states allow in some form. Twelve conservative states now generally do not require any permit or training for an adult to carry a loaded handgun in public, a policy called ""constitutional carry."" In contrast, seven more liberal states issue permits sparingly and require citizens to demonstrate a justifiable need for carrying a concealed weapon. These tougher laws mean that few residents of cities Los Angeles or New York are given permits to carry concealed guns. There is also wide variation in training requirements – from states that require applicants to demonstrate actual proficiency in firing a gun, to Virginia, which requires only an online safety training course. Under current law, states do not have to recognize carry permits issued by other states, creating a confusing patchwork of regulations on whether gun owners from one state can carry their concealed weapon in another state. For years, the NRA has been trying to pass a federal law to require every state to recognize every other state's gun-carrying permits – which would make it as easy to carry a concealed gun across the country as it is to drive a car. Donald Trump has endorsed the legislation. Law enforcement officials from the nation's largest cities say this legislation would be a public safety disaster, gutting the tough restrictions in states like New York and California to and forcing them to recognize gun carry permits from all states, no matter how weak those state's laws. The NRA-backed legislation would force all states to recognize gun-carrying permits from any other state, including the dozen states that generally do not require any training or permit to carry a gun, a policy called “constitutional carry”. West Virginia’s choice to allow “constitutional carry” of concealed handguns “might be fine for West Virginia, but it’s not fine for New York City”, said Cy Vance, Manhattan’s district attorney. “I wouldn’t presume to tell West Virginia, as a New Yorker, what West Virginia’s laws should be with regard to gun possession. Can you imagine how mad they’d be?” Donald Trump endorsed the legislation during his campaign last year. Its passage came the same day that gun violence survivors, including residents of Newtown, Connecticut, were visiting congressional offices to ask politicians, once again, to take some action on gun control. Nearly five years after the 2012 Newtown school shooting, which left 26 children and educators dead, Congress has yet to pass any gun control laws. It’s not (just) about the money. In 2017, the NRA spent at least $4.1m on lobbying – more than the $3.1m it spent in all of 2016. But for comparison, the dairy industry has spent $4.4m in the same period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). The National Association of Realtors, one of the biggest spenders, has paid out $32.2m lobbying on housing issues. The NRA has plenty of cash to spend. It bet big on the 2016 US elections, pouring $14.4m into supporting 44 candidates who won and $34.4m opposing 19 candidates who lost, according to CRP. But “the real source of its power, I believe, comes from voters,” said Adam Winkler, a UCLA professor of constitutional law. The 145-year-old organization claims 5 million active members, that number is disputed, but whatever its actual size, membership is a powerful tool, said Robert Spitzer, a professor at the State University of New York at Cortland. “They have a very powerful ability to mobilize a grassroots support and to engage in politics when most Americans can barely be bothered to vote,” he said. “And because so few Americans do those things, if you get a bunch of people in a locality who are all prepared to go out to a meeting they can have a big effect."" Read more “We have nothing but heartache and compassion for the victims of Sandy Hook, but concealed carry reciprocity has nothing to do with this tragedy,” said Tatum Gibson, a spokeswoman for Richard Hudson, the North Carolina Republican congressman who introduced the legislation, said in a statement when asked about the timing of the vote. “I don’t know that putting the NRA’s agenda on the floor of the House is the right way to mark five years since Sandy Hook,” Murphy told the Guardian. “It is heartbreaking to think as we come up to the fifth anniversary of Newtown, Republicans in the House are pushing through a bill to make our country less safe.” At the same time, Murphy argued, the political maneuvering over the bill could be seen as a sign of the growing strength of the gun control movement. Before the House vote, Republicans combined the controversial NRA-backed “Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act” with a modest measure to make sure the military and other federal agencies are reporting records to the nation’s gun background check system. The Sutherland Springs mass shooting last month revealed that the air force had failed to submit to the background checks system dozens of records that should have disqualified dangerous people from gun ownership, including the domestic violence conviction of the man who went on to murder 26 people at a small Baptist church in Texas. “It says something really interesting about the vulnerability that Republicans feel on guns today,” Murphy said. “Republicans are increasingly worried about the optics of pushing the NRA agenda, and that’s why they’re trying to add on some anti-gun violence legislation.” Republicans’ attempt to tear down local restrictions on gun carrying comes just weeks after two of America’s deadliest mass shootings, at a country music concert in Las Vegas and a tiny church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The move highlights the stark divide in Americans’ opinions on guns, with some conservatives seeing increased civilian gun carrying as a way to prevent or lessen the toll of mass shootings, even as many other Americans are trying to fight against America’s gun-carrying culture and get guns off the street. Under current law, states have dramatically different standards for who is allowed to carry a concealed, loaded weapon. A handful of more liberal states give law enforcement officials discretion when granting a carry permit and some require that applicants demonstrate a specific need for self-defense. But the majority of states make it easy for citizens to get a carry license. While some states require that permit holders demonstrate proficiency with a gun at a firing range, others only require some kind of gun safety course. In Virginia, applicants don’t even need to leave the house: it’s possible to get a concealed carry license after taking a gun safety course online. Many states currently recognize each other’s carry permits, in the same way states recognize each other’s driver’s licenses, but some states pick and choose which licenses they will honor, and a few states, including New York, recognize no outside permits at all. Gun rights advocates say the current patchwork of state laws governing gun carrying is confusing for law-abiding gun owners, and that American states and cities with the toughest gun control laws are violating Americans’ constitutional right to carry firearms for self-defense. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, hailed the bill’s passage in a statement saying “the truth is that concealed carry laws save lives”. Opponents of the legislation say the right way to fix the confusion over differing regulations is to create a uniform national standard for training and eligibility, not simply force the states with the toughest gun control regulations to allow the most untrained, unvetted gun carriers to walk their streets. Adam Winkler, a gun law expert at the University of California Los Angeles, said the legislation the House is currently considering would also allow local residents in cites with tough restrictions to do an end run around local laws, and get their permit to carry a gun from another state with weaker laws. One of the proposed Democratic amendments to the bill would close that loophole. An estimated three million Americans report carrying a loaded handgun on a daily basis, and an estimated nine million report doing so on a monthly basis, according to a recent study based on a survey conducted by Harvard and Northeastern researchers.",2017-12-06 23:17:47,House passes 'unthinkable' NRA-backed bill lifting local gun restrictions,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,gun control,terrorism,crime and criminals,firearms,murders and attempted murders,violence",1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

(GoFundMe) A Maryland woman who was shot in the head during the Las Vegas mass shooting will be celebrating the holidays at her home after spending more than two months in the hospital. Tina Frost left an inpatient rehabilitation center on Friday and will “continue therapies on an outpatient basis” for her recovery, her family posted on their GoFundMe page. Frost was at the Route 91 Harvest Festival with her boyfriend when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire at the crowd of concertgoers. “She walked out of the inpatient rehabilitation hospital [on Friday], got into Austin’s car and will have several days off from all of the doctors, nurses, therapists, dieticians [sic], technicians and everyone else who knocks on her door ‘every five minutes,’” her family wrote. MOM ACCUSED OF SUBJECTING SON TO 323 HOSPITAL VISITS, 13 SURGERIES The family called the moment in Frost’s recovery a “huge milestone” and said they hope to have a “wonderful holiday season” because they have a lot to celebrate. Frost was among the nearly 500 people injured in the massacre. Another 58 people were killed. The 27-year-old underwent several surgeries and had her right eye removed, where the bullet was lodged. Another bone in her forehead was also taken out to relieve brain swelling. 9-YEAR-OLD DONATES LIFE SAVINGS TO HELP SICK KIDS She made huge strides in her recovery when she woke up from her coma about two weeks after the shooting and was eventually moved to a rehabilitation center in late November. Frost’s family requested privacy as the 27-year-old returns home. Frost’s GoFundMe page created to help pay for medical costs has raised more than $600,000 as of Wednesday.

          / CBS/AP LAS VEGAS — The organizers of a fund for the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting say they will stop taking donations on Jan. 31. Stephen Paddock, a high-stakes gambler, killed 58 people and injured hundreds more on Oct. 1 after he shattered windows of his hotel suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed withering gunfire at the Route 91 Harvest music festival below before killing himself. Las Vegas Victims' Fund Committee Chairman Scott Nielson told the Las Vegas Review-Journal Friday that they are gearing up to allocate funds between all the victims and their families. The fund received about $16 million in donations so far. Survivors, first responders, people who worked the event and family members of the victims are eligible to submit a claim for a donation from the fund. CBS affiliate KLAS reported on Nov. 28 that the most recent draft of the fund's proposed guidelines for distribution prioritizes relatives of those who were killed and survivors who were hospitalized.

(AP/Eric Paddock) The mass murderer who gunned down 58 people during a Las Vegas music festival in October died of a self-inflicted gunshot to the mouth, a coroner’s report said. Stephen Paddock’s death was ruled a suicide, according to Clark County, Nev., Coroner John Fudenberg. Authorities said the high-stakes video poker gambler, 64, killed himself before officers reached his room. Stephen Paddock fired from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, Oct. 1, 2017.
      (Associated Press) All 58 deaths were ruled homicides in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, authorities said. Twenty-one victims were shot in the head, 36 died with chest and back wounds and one died of a gunshot to a leg, the coroner's report said. Four victims had multiple gunshot wounds. The mass killer, armed with an arsenal of assault-style weapons and ammunition, also injured about 500 other people when he unleashed more than 1,100 rounds of gunfire from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay into a crowd of 22,000 people at the Route 91 Harvest Festival just below the hotel. Broken windows mark gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel suite in Las Vegas.
      (Associated Press) When police stormed Paddock’s suite after he stopped firing, they discovered shell casings all over the floor, the New York Post reported. Authorities reported finding about 4,000 unused rounds along with the 23 guns in the suite. However, authorities have not said why Paddock stopped shooting. “My initial scan, coming in the room with my rifle, is just seeing, I’m seeing one male down, bleeding from the face,” Officer Matthew Donaldson told the Post. “He was not a threat. Kept going, kept going, kept going.” Police and the FBI have also not said publicly what motivated him. Autopsy reports in the case are not yet complete, officials said. Paddock’s brain was sent to Stanford University in California to study after a visual inspection found no abnormalities. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

          / AP LAS VEGAS -- A plan that will be used to divide donations for victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting was finalized Friday with a significant change that allows injured people who were not hospitalized to seek some of the money. The committee overseeing the distribution of more than $22 million revised an earlier draft in response to requests that money also go to people who did not require a hospital stay after the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history. The group received more than 1,700 comments from victims' families, survivors, community members and others. The plan calls for most of the money to go to relatives of the 58 people killed or victims whose injuries left them with permanent brain damage or paralysis, requiring constant home care. Individuals who were physically injured and hospitalized can submit a claim. So can those who received medical treatment for physical injuries on an emergency or outpatient basis on or before Oct. 10. ""We appreciate all of the individuals who shared their heartbreaking stories with us over the past couple of weeks,"" Las Vegas Victims' Fund committee chairman Scott Nielson said in a statement. ""The committee heard from many different voices and considered those comments as we were drafting the final protocol on how best to distribute these funds."" The deadline to submit claims is Jan. 31. Payments are expected to begin March 5. A high-stakes gambler killed 58 people and injured more than 500 others on Oct. 1 after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below. He then killed himself. Donations for the victims began to pour in within hours of the shooting. A GoFundMe page has collected about $11.7 million. More money was collected by accounts, including the Direct Impact Fund, a nonprofit affiliated with GoFundMe, and the National Compassion Fund, which was created by victims and families of mass casualty events. Nielson said the committee recognizes people are experiencing psychological trauma from the massacre, but the ""overwhelming number of victims prevents us from providing individual monetary payments"" to them. The group is working with officials and others to make mental health support easily accessible to all those affected regardless of where they live.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. LAS VEGAS – The maker of a rapid-fire gun accessory that police say was used in the Oct. 1 mass shooting that killed 58 people and left hundreds injured at an open-air concert on the Las Vegas Strip has been removed from a wounded California woman's negligence and damages lawsuit, a lawyer said Thursday. Attorney Craig Eiland, representing Rachel Sheppard, said the decision to strip Slide Fire Solutions from the case will let him focus on her claims that hotel owner MGM Resorts International and concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment did not follow active shooter planning and procedures. Eiland noted that Texas-based Slide Fire still faces a separate lawsuit seeking class-action status in Nevada on negligence and product liability claims relating to its ""bump stock"" weapon modification device. Court filings allege that Slide Fire marketed the device to gun owners who wanted semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. ""One of the MGM and Live Nation defenses will be foreseeability,"" Eiland said of a contention that no one could know that a 64-year-old high-stakes video poker player would amass an arsenal of 23 guns and rain gunfire from a 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay into a crowd of 22,000 people at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. Police have said many of the assault-style guns in the room had been modified with ""bump stock"" devices to help the gunman shoot more rapidly. Eiland said he found evidence that Las Vegas Strip casino-hotels plan with police for responses to crimes and disasters. ""If police are working with you on a response to an active shooter, it means it is foreseeable,"" Eiland said. An MGM Resorts spokeswoman, Debra DeShong, declined to comment on the new legal filing or its claims. ""We will give our response through the appropriate legal channel,"" she said. Live Nation and Slide Fire Solutions did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Live Nation, of Beverly Hills, California, has previously expressed sorrow that people were ""forever impacted by this senseless act of violence."" Authorities say shooter Stephen Paddock killed himself before officers reached his room. A motive for what became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history has not been identified. The lawsuit by Sheppard, of Tehachapi, California, is one of several filed to date in Nevada and other states. A set of five cases filed Nov. 20 in Los Angeles by Houston-based attorneys on behalf of some 450 plaintiffs killed or injured in the concert crowd did not name Slide Fire as a defendant. Eiland noted that federal product liability laws make it difficult to sue firearms makers. However, the ""bump stock"" maker was named, along with MGM Resorts, Live Nation and other defendants, in a series of 14 cases filed together Nov. 15 in Nevada state court in Las Vegas.

""It does potentially start controversy, but it has become a reality,"" says Yasir Sheikh, the 32-year-old president and CEO of Guard Dog Security, a Sanford, Florida-based manufacturer and distributor of self-defense products. The advertisement was one of two created for a retail client. In the other version, the children are seen from the back, and running in the opposite direction, under the phrase: ""The Smart Kids Are Protected."" The Guard Dog Security website offers a variety of products for those looking to defend themselves from urban threats: ""the world's first and only stun gun, flash light and pepper spray in one compact, hand-held design,"" a bulletproof calendar that can be used to protect oneself in the event of a workplace shooting, a tactical baton that's available in pink. ""It's never too early,"" Guard Dog Security CEO Yasir Sheikh says of his line of bulletproof... [+] backpacks. Consumers looking to provide themselves and their children with ""smart"" tools for personal defense may be drawn to the Guard Dog ProShield II bulletproof backpack. It's $197.99, ""ideal for youth, college students, travelers and professionals alike,"" and has been tested and certified against .44 Magnum and 9-millimeter cartridges. In addition to its lightweight armor, the backpack is equipped with a built-in auxiliary port. There's an all-black model and one with a pink front panel.  According to Sheikh, 60 percent of his customers are women. When children are at school, they're out of reach of the protection of their parents. In the event of a school shooting, could a bulletproof backpack prevent a child from being a shooting victim? The backpacks weren't designed solely for kids, but, at least in theory, bulletproof panels could stop a bullet from killing a child. After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in which, after shooting his mother at their home, Adam Lanza, 20, shot 20 elementary school children, six school staff members, and then committed suicide, Sheikh saw in the news that a company was selling bulletproof backpacks. He reached out to the company about distributing the product, but he didn't hear back from them. That company went out of business, and Sheikh manufactured his own bulletproof backpacks. ""The idea behind them was, because of the increasing number of mass shootings and violence, there was inevitably going to be a need for bulletproof backpacks,"" Sheikh says. After the October 1, 2017, mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which shooter Stephen Paddock, 64, left 58 dead and 546 injured, sales of Guard Dog's ProShield line of bulletproof backpacks spiked. ""The idea of a mass shooting has become more of a reality,"" Sheikh says. With the ProShield backpack, ""In the event of a shooting, you're protected. Wearing it is definitely a sad reality, but we're kind of in that day and age."" As for kids in school, he adds: ""It's never too early.""

All 58 people killed during the massacre at the country music festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 died of gunshot wounds, a coroner’s report confirmed Thursday -- showing that none of the victims died from injuries related to their attempts to escape the chaotic scene. The deaths of all those killed by gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, during the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival were considered homicides, Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg said. LAS VEGAS GUNMAN STEPHEN PADDOCK’S $5M ESTATE TO BE SETTLED IN COURT, JUDGE SAYS Still, nearly three months later, investigators have not yet publicly released a motive in what's considered the deadliest mass shooting in American history. The coroner also said Paddock, who killed himself after the ambush, died of a single self-inflicted gunshot to the mouth. His death was considered a suicide. Fudenberg said he waited to release the autopsy findings until all the families involved had the information. In addition to those killed, more than 500 people were injured during the deadly shooting spree. Paddock, holed up in a luxury suite on the 32 floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition at a crowd of concertgoers. LAS VEGAS MASSACRE GUNMAN FIRED MORE THAN 1,100 ROUNDS, SHERIFF SAYS Paddock ultimately killed himself as police approached his hotel room. Police and the FBI have not said publicly what they think motivated Paddock to amass an arsenal of assault-style weapons and ammunition in a two-room suite and then rain bursts of gunfire for 10 minutes from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay into a crowd of 22,000 people at the festival below. They also haven't said why they think he stopped shooting. Paddock's brain was sent to Stanford University in California to study after a visual inspection during found no abnormalities.

          / CBS News Before the suspect in Sunday's deadly mass shooting at a Texas church fled a mental health facility in 2012, he allegedly told other patients being treated at the hospital he'd ordered guns online, according to police documents obtained by CBS affiliate KENS. Devin Patrick Kelley: What we know about the Texas church shooting suspect Devin Kelley was sent to the Peak Behavioral Health Services Center in Santa Teresa, New Mexico after multiple incidents between June 2011 and April 2012 in which he beat his wife and stepson, who suffered a fractured skull in one incident. He escaped on June 13, 2012 with his wallet and credit card, according to the documents. Kelley, who was listed at the facility as a high-risk patient — a danger to himself and to others — told other patients that he ordered guns online about 48 to 72 hours before he fled the facility, according to the documents. Police were notified through a 911 call at 10:49 p.m. that night that Kelley was missing. He was found at an El Paso bus station, just over an hour and a half later, at 12:30 in the morning. While Kelley was missing, 911 dispatchers alerted officials at Hollaman Air Force Base, where Kelley was stationed, that he escaped. Texas church shooting victims: Pregnant mother, children among lives lost An El Paso Police Department report from the incident warned that Kelley had already been caught sneaking firearms"" onto the base, where he ""was attempting to carry out death threats that (he) had made on his military chain of command."" El Paso police arrested Kelley without incident at a bus stop and turned him over to New Mexico police. Kelley was sentenced about five months later, on November 7, 2012 for the assaults on his wife and child, and was ordered to serve a year in confinement. In 2014, Kelley received a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force, which was supposed to notify the FBI of his domestic violence conviction. Kelley should have been barred from buying the weapons used in Sunday's shooting, federal officials say. The Air Force acknowledged Monday that it failed to flag Kelley as banned from buying firearms. The Air Force said it has launched a review of how the service handled Kelley's criminal records. Texas authorities say Kelley did not have a license to carry firearms. However, Kelley purchased four weapons in total during the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Two were bought in Colorado and two in Texas, ATF officials said. Three weapons were recovered at the scene of the shooting -- a Ruger AR-556 rifle found at the church, and two handguns, a Glock 9mm and a Ruger 22, found in his car, according to Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of the ATF Houston. In a statement to CBS News, Peak Behavioral Health said it would not confirm whether Kelley was a patient at the facility, citing federal and state law, as well as the company's policies. ""Our hearts go out to the victims of this horrible act and their families and friends, and like everyone else in Texas, we are doing everything we can to help the community in recovering and healing from this tragedy,"" the company said.

308,https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisputnamwalkerly/2017/12/03/maintaining-focus-in-the-face-of-tragedy/,"Memorial for victims of a mass shooting in Las Vegas. AP Photo/John Locher Tragedy Should Redouble – Not Dilute – Your Focus in Community It seems that nearly every week now, we wake to morning news of some devastating tragedy somewhere in the world, and often very close to home. There are the natural disasters like hurricanes and fires, and the manmade ones, like the recent mass shootings in Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, and in Egypt. When these tragedies unfold, we want to respond. We feel an instinctive pull to drop everything and run to the aid of our fellow human beings. If we were in close proximity, we might well grab a bucket to bail water or squelch flames, take in those needing shelter, provide aid to the injured, or even – as was the case in Texas – chase away those doing evil. And when we read about tragedies that are hundreds of miles or even oceans away from us, we still want to respond, and do so with our gifts of money, prayers, and conversations with those around us about what might be done to provide relief, help rebuild, and prevent future catastrophe. These are natural and noble responses. But they can also distract us from the tragedies that unfold daily in our own communities. Their physical distance from us can lead us to overlook the nearby occurrences that apply to our own work. The shooters in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, and the terrorist attackers at an Egyptian mosque got our attention because of the scale of their assaults and the many people who lost lives. Yet people lose their lives to gun violence in our own communities more often than we notice. Chicago recorded over 600 homicides by mid-November of this year, for example. But the loss of one or two local lives to violence is no less of a tragedy or a mental health issue than the loss of multiple lives far away. If we care about gun violence that happens in other communities, then we must care about it in our own and maintain a focus on what we can do right here, right now. The hurricanes and fires that devastated so many homes and lives at either end of the country are likely tied to our changing climate. And that climate is changing in the heartland of America just as it is on the coasts. Therefore, addressing the issue at home in, say, Omaha, Nebraska is just as important as it is in Sonoma County, California or in Houston, Texas. In addition, there are those in our communities who are devastated by loss of homes for myriad reasons, some having to do with those forces of nature and others the forces of social policies, economy or simply neglect. How do we respond to – or better yet work to prevent – those tragedies? This isn’t to say we shouldn’t lend our aid in any way possible to those in need across the country or around the world. We absolutely should. But we should also remember to ask ourselves, “How is what’s happened there related to what’s happening, or could happen, here at home? And what can we do about it?” Additional Reading: Teach Giving With Three Empty Jars Five Things Jeff Bezos Needs To Know Before Giving Away Billions 10 Ways Community Foundations Are A Best-Bet For Disaster Giving I am a global philanthropy expert, author of Delusional Altruism and was named Philanthropy Advisor of the Year.

309,https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddessig/2017/12/27/the-four-biggest-mental-health-myths-of-2017-debunked/,"Myths about mental illness and psychotherapy were central in many of the biggest stories of 2017: mass shootings, gun violence, sexual harassment, addictions. Other psychology myths were featured in marketing messages from purveyors of risky, untested techno-therapies. So, with all the optimism bred by another new year about to start, let’s roll up our sleeves and bust those myths. But, first, a note of caution because small doses of fact-based rationality will probably have little or no influence. No minds will change; the obstacles are too strong. After all, the current administration actually advised researchers in the CDC not to use terms like “evidence-based” and “science-based” in budget proposals—nothing should get in the way of the leader’s message, certainly not fact and reason! Unfortunately, there is no easy way around our susceptibility to falsehoods from the powerful. Our psychology gets in the way, things like the confirmation bias and the availability heuristic. They make us easy prey for Kellyanne’s post-truth world of “alternative facts.” When people in power mislead with messages that provide followers with secret pleasure, and then they say it over and over and then over again, it creates beliefs impossible to shake. Lies become the myths and stories we live by. Nevertheless, you gotta stay in the game, right?  So, lets bust those mental health myths. With the year changing, the time is ripe to debunk the year's mental health myths. Shutterstock Myth #1: Mental illness causes mass shootings 2017 was a tough year to have a human body. Lots of bullets flying around public places. And lots of nonsense came out the mouths of politicians, like the myth that blames the mentally ill for America’s mass shootings. Of course, believing that mental illness causes the unspeakable horror of a mass shooting makes intuitive sense. After all, someone would have to be absolutely bat-sh*t crazy to fire an automatic weapon into a crowd of strangers for apparently no reason, or to gun down entire families while they worship in church. The act itself defines the person as a real “sicko.” But that misses the point. To say mental illness is the cause means that a diagnosable mental illness had to be present before the shooting. One can’t just invoke mental illness after the fact because the shooting is itself so horrific as to defy any common sense understanding. Also, the shooting needed to be part of the illness, like drug-seeking being part of addiction or being unable to experience any pleasure or good feelings being part of depression. And committing  incomprehensibly horrorific acts is not a usual part of mental illness. Plus, the research is clear: Mental illness does not cause mass shootings. Period. Full stop. Bethany Lilly of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law said “there is no real connection between an individual with a mental health diagnosis and mass shootings. That connection according to all experts doesn't exist.” So, for example, Paul Ryan was either lying for the politically expedient reason of not wanting to alienate gun rights activists or he was dangerously misinformed when he said “One of the things we've learned from these shootings is often underneath this is a diagnosis of mental illness.” And that leaves the question, why does this happen in America so frequently while mass shooting are rare or non-existent in every other developed nation? The simple answer is violent men have unfettered access to guns. Mass shootings result from powerful weapons being in the hands of violent men, men who frequently have a history of domestic violence. Consider an analysis of information culled from both public sources and the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Report. It showed that 54% of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016 were related to domestic violence. In other words, mass shootings are usually men violently lashing out at women and children. So, let’s get people with mental illness the treatments they deserve and stop blaming them for putting powerful weapons into the hands of violent men. And lets follow Wisconsin and get guns out of the hands of violent men. That’s where the solutions will be. As Tage Rai wrote in The Behavioral Scientist: “Perpetuating the myth that mental illness is the cause of mass shootings only serves to stigmatize the mentally ill even further. In addition, it distracts from the more difficult conversation that must be had over gun-control in America. Myth #2:  No one waits 40 years to report sexual abuse Opposing the #MeToo movement was an insidious countervailing force we can call the #IDidntDoIt movement. Led by President Trump denying allegations of sexual harassment by claiming a woman making such a report was not attractive enough to warrant his attention, the deniers find reasons to deny, deny, deny. The most pernicious form of #IDidntDoIt being the myth that too much time elapsed between the alleged harassment and the report. For example, consider supporters of Roy Moore, (the losing Republican candidate in the recent Alabama Senate race who garnered enough support to show that for some GOP stands for Gathering Of Pedophiles). Many dismissed reports of his having sexually abused an underage girl by claiming those reports have no credibility because 40 years had elapsed between the abuse and the report. Too much time. Therefore, it must be a politically-motivated hit job. But, as clinicians know who work with people who have been sexually abused and harassed (which pretty much means most women), anyone who dismisses a report of sexual harassment because there was a gap of 40 years, or 10 or 2 or whatever, between the abuse and the report does not understand anything, and I mean nothing, about the aftermath of sexual trauma. People (and, yes, including men and boys who are sometimes targets for sexual predators, just not typically), often wait and for very good reasons. Here are three reasons I’ve frequently encountered in my clinical work for why a report of sexual abuse will frequently be delayed by years, or even decades. The first is shame. People who have been sexually harassed and abused often wonder it they did something wrong to cause it, maybe if they are something wrong. Many wonder if they could have done more to stop it. Those feelings of responsibility can sometimes help quiet even worse feelings of powerlessness. But the price of personal responsibility is shame, and shame leads to silence. The second is a fear of retaliation. In the days following the Access Hollywood revelation that President Trump was fiercely proud of having sexually harassed a series of women, he threatened to sue all those who had come forward to corroborate his accounts. Deny and retaliate. The harm caused by getting on Harvey Weinstein’s wrong side has been amply documented, including Salma Hayek’s chilling story. Threaten and retaliate. But you don’t need to be a celebrity to retaliate. For example, people in service industries face the constant threat of job loss, or worse. So, never underestimate the actual, real risks taken by people who report sexual predators. The third is not wanting to lose control over one’s identity. Prior to the #MeToo movement once you made a public accusation you became “that person.” Having been sexually abused or being a complainer comes to define your identity. And many want to leave the sexual abuse behind, not let it define life or career. Until recently few had the inner resources to risk being another Anita Hill whose truth-telling was both ignored and came to define her identity. We can all be thankful this is changing. Myth #3: Being a sexual predator is an addiction With #MeToo reducing the pain of reporting harassment and abuse and thereby increasing freedom to report such behavior, what’s a sexual predator to do? One strategy employed by Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey was to seek inpatient treatment for their raging sex addictions. The only problem with their appeal for understanding and compassion is that there is no such thing. The American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) position is clear; sex addiction is not a valid nor useful diagnosis. Of course, some people have real trouble controlling sexual urges and then use the power of their position to exploit others to gratify those urges. They’ve gotten away with it because, as our President famously said, “when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.” But abusing power in the service of sexual gratification is not an addiction. It’s really bad behavior. Plus, when celebrity evil doers like Harvey Weinstein try to hide their malfeasance behind a screen of sex addiction they stigmatize those actually suffering from and trying to recover from an addiction, and take attention away from those who have been harmed by their bad behavior. Myth #4: Having a transcript of your text therapy session makes it more powerful The last myth we’ll bust appeared in marketing messages from text-therapy subscription services like Talkspace and Betterhelp. In addition to putting users at unacceptable levels of avoidable clinical risk, including basic privacy and confidentiality, these companies boast that having an archive of exchanges with one’s therapist makes the treatment more useful and powerful. But boasting about something doesn’t make it so, especially when the boast is demonstrably false. In fact, research on what’s been called the ""Google effect” suggests that having access to a searchable archive of your therapy sessions makes it less likely you will be able to access the information you need in the moment you need it. The “Google effect” research documents that when people believe information is stored online, they will learn where and how to find the information rather than remembering the actual information. So, when it comes to remembering the lessons of a therapy session, having access to a searchable archive means the therapy will have less consequence, not more. But there might be the even more insidious danger of fostering unhealthy (but lucrative for the service) dependence on the subscription service. When distributed memory is applied to psychotherapy the user becomes dependent on the service that holds the archive. Consider how, as described by John Bohannon writing in Science Magazine “people divide the labor of remembering certain types of shared information. For example, a husband might rely on his wife to remember significant dates, while she relies on him to remember the names of distant friends and family—and this frees both from duplicating the memories in their own brains.” Unfortunately for those pulled into these services, having therapy change your brain is the point. And do you really want to be married to a subscription service to get the information you need to live a better life. You want what took place to be inside you, to be with you, not stored someplace on a server you pay a monthly fee to access. And with that said, let me wish everyone a more rational, fact-based 2018.

310,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/505159542/0/phoenix/local~Las-Vegas-shooting-Patients-went-to-wrong-hospital-as-misinformation-spread/,"LAS VEGAS — They found the couple sprawled across the warm asphalt outside the Route 91 Harvest festival. Blood seeped from bullet wounds, his near an elbow, hers on the head. Panicked concertgoers streamed past them. David Hendrickson, an EMT who attended the Oct. 1 concert, stopped and knelt beside the couple. The woman was growing woozy. Blood soaked through the shirt tied around her head. Hendrickson tightened it, and then took off his own shirt and tied it around the man’s arm. “We need to get these guys to the hospital,” Hendrickson told his girlfriend, Michelle Wolters. There was no time to wait for an ambulance. The four climbed into Wolters’ Mercedes. Blood seeped into the leather seats. Hendrickson started the car and inched through the crowd near Mandalay Bay. They had driven in from California and nobody in the car knew the local hospitals, so Wolters pulled out her iPhone. With shaking fingers, she typed in ""Vegas hospital."" Sunrise Hospital appeared at the top of the list. “All right,” Hendrickson said, “we’re gonna go there.” They had no way to know that Sunrise would soon become overwhelmed with patients, with every gurney full and ""red-tag"" triage patients waiting for care. At the same time, the county’s most comprehensive trauma center, University Medical Center, barely three miles away, was preparing itself for victims who never arrived. Metropolitan Las Vegas has a trauma response plan designed to send manageable numbers of patients to each hospital. The plan dictates which injuries must be treated at a trauma center and which ones can go to a regular hospital. It splits Clark County into three areas and assigns each one a trauma center where patients should be taken. The Route 91 Harvest festival stage was at a location designated for UMC. But in the hours after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, that plan became impossible to follow. MORE: The 58 victims of the Las Vas shooting Bystanders like Hendrickson and Wolters loaded victims into their cars and drove them to the first hospital they could find, bypassing the county's transport system entirely. Confusion and rumors swirled, partly because the county lacks the central communications system that emergency planners called for in 2009. That resulted in an uneven rush of patients into hospitals all over Clark County. Sunrise, a Level II trauma center, treated 199 patients in a few hours. UMC, Nevada’s only Level I trauma center and the hospital President Donald Trump visited after the massacre, took 104 patients. A handful of UMC's beds remained empty as rumors it had closed it doors spread through the county. Hundreds more patients filtered into smaller hospitals. “Some places got hit hard,” said UMC trauma director Dr. John Fildes. “But that’s what happens when 500 people went down.” City, county and hospital officials insist their response to the shooting went as smoothly as possible. “From an emergency response perspective, the event was very professionally managed,” Clark County Fire Chief Greg Cassell said in a statement. No complaints have been filed with the state’s health department, and a spokeswoman for the Division of Public and Behavioral Health said she was not aware of any complaints about the emergency response. “If it’s a problem, it needs to be addressed,” said John Hammond, the EMS and trauma system manager for the Southern Nevada Health District, about the imbalance of patients at hospitals. “But I don’t know if it’s a problem.” Among the unanswerable questions from a night of terror is whether the Level I trauma center should have received more patients, potentially spreading the work more evenly among over-burdened emergency workers. The drop in care from a Level I to a Level II trauma center is minimal, experts say, and often disputed. Nationwide studies of their treatment have given mixed results. Some research shows that more people die at Level II centers, which aren’t required to have as many specialists or treat as many patients annually as top-tier centers. Other research shows more people die at Level I centers, because those places receive the patients closest to death. It’s impossible to know if the confusion caused any patients to receive lesser treatment. But it at least created disparate levels of chaos at the region’s two largest trauma centers. At Sunrise, the flow of patients seemed never to stop. Staff, space and resources ran thin. The hospital used up its entire supply of universally compatible O-negative blood, and at least one ER doctor said he worked until his brain couldn’t process charts anymore. Every gurney and wheelchair in the hospital held a patient. Some patients waited on the floor. Others with minor injuries walked out, not wanting to take up time or resources that could be used on more critical patients. A few miles away, UMC’s trauma director wondered where the rest of the patients were. Around 1:45 a.m., Fildes counted nine empty trauma bays. Three operating rooms sat open. Even two months after the shooting, nobody has determined exactly why patients stopped arriving at UMC. But in the immediate aftermath, rumors spread by word of mouth and on social media that UMC had closed its doors. Multiple emergency workers and hospital staffers told The Arizona Republic they heard, at some point during the evening, that UMC had stopped taking patients. Representatives of two ambulance companies heard it. Two Sunrise staffers said they heard it. Two medics working at the concert venue received texts about it. None of those people could identify the source of the rumor. ""So many injuries that UMC hospital having to divert to other hospitals,"" Las Vegas blogger Christy Oldenkamp wrote on Twitter. Other accounts tweeted similar rumors. It wasn’t true. UMC didn’t close, and nothing similar appears in an audio recording of Clark County Fire Department dispatchers in the first hour after the shooting. Fildes, the UMC trauma director, recalled telling somebody at Sunrise that he had room to take their excess patients. He remembered asking for them to come three at a time, so his teams could focus on the most critical patients. In an email, Fildes said he couldn't remember how many more arrived. The Southern Nevada Health District’s trauma plan, last updated in February 2015, dictates that a patient must be taken to a trauma center if he or she has certain injuries, including a “penetrating injury to the head, neck, torso or the extremities proximal to the elbow or knee.” It then divides Clark County into three segments: Trauma patients injured in an eastern area should be taken to Sunrise, which is northeast of the Strip. Patients in an area to the south should go to St. Rose Dominican Hospital, Siena Campus, in nearby Henderson. Patients found anywhere else in the county go to UMC, which is northwest of the Strip. The Route 91 concert stage was in a part of the county for which UMC was responsible. The plan allows for exceptions if bad traffic or dangerous weather make the designated hospital too difficult to reach in time. It's designed to make first responders, ambulance drivers and other emergency personnel work in unison, all following the same strategy to move people to hospitals. It does not mention how to handle a mass of gunshot victims being transported in pickup trucks and strangers’ backseats. So when it came time for the plan to be implemented, confusion ruled the moments after the shooting. Emergency responders weren’t sure if it was safe to head toward the festival grounds. False reports of multiple shooters circulated. One man on the Clark County Fire Department dispatch radio kept repeating reports of a man in Army fatigues climbing into a van. Through it all, audio recordings obtained by The Arizona Republic show, the dispatch feed flooded with requests for ambulances. “The ambulances do not have enough units to transfer all the gunshot wounds,” one responder reported. “We are out of ambulances and we still have a couple more criticals,” said another. “Chief, we’re currently loading patients into private vehicles. We have no more ambulances,” still another said. “We’re getting pickup trucks full of patients coming in."" In 2009, a study of the region's trauma plan concluded that Clark County needed a centralized communications center to handle emergency situations, rather than relying on a patchwork system of dispatchers and hospitals. That center was never created. “We’ve been trying to fix that problem for a while,” the health district's Hammond said recently, noting that the initial set-up of a system could cost upward of $1 million. “Not just for large events, but for everyday movement of patients within the system, a centralized system would be better.” The streets were jammed when Hendrickson pulled his girlfriend’s car off the Strip. He and Wolters tried to introduce themselves to the strange couple in their backseat, searching for some way into a conversation. The man said his name was David, too. That was a start. He introduced his girlfriend as Stephanie. Her alertness started to fade. They reached a red light. Hendrickson blew through it. A truck filled with bleeding people sped past them, clambering over the median and through a turn lane. A six-mile drive took 10 minutes.

Hospital staff had filled the ambulance bays with as many wheelchairs and gurneys as they could find. An ER doctor and nurses worked in a hurried quiet. A small group crowded around the Mercedes. “Backseat,” Hendrickson told them. He and Wolters watched as nurses pulled out the couple and helped them onto gurneys. Then they disappeared into the crowded hospital. ""We’ve been trying to look for them and see if they’re OK,"" Wolters said recently. ""It does kind of bother us that we don’t know how they are.""

          / CBS News By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto As the anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School approaches, one third of Americans –  and women in particular - say the level of gun violence in the United States today is a crisis, and most call it at least a very serious problem. But views on what to do about it are mixed. There is strong bipartisan support for background checks for all gun buyers, and most think measures like better mental health treatment would do a lot to help, too. But there are also sharp partisan differences around ideas like allowing teachers to carry guns, and on whether to ban assault weapons, generally. Sixty-nine percent of Americans believe the amount of gun violence in the U.S. is at least very serious, including a third who call it a crisis. More women see gun violence as a crisis than men do, and Democrats are three times as likely as Republicans to see it that way. More than half of Americans – 57 percent - want laws covering the sale of guns to be made more strict than they are now, but sharp partisan divides remain on this, in principle. More women favor stricter laws than men, and those living in rural areas of the country are less likely to support stricter gun laws then residents in the cities and suburbs. Most think better mental health screening and treatment would do a lot to help prevent gun violence. Nearly half think tougher sentences on criminals and gang members would help a lot, and about four in ten say that about stricter gun laws and having more armed police or guards in public places. Fewer think allowing more law-abiding citizens to carry guns to help a lot, but 46 percent of Republicans think it would. Nearly half of Americans are at least somewhat concerned about the threat of a mass shooting in the area where they live, but just 21 percent are very concerned. This level of concern is not much different than it was in 2015, soon after a shooting at a holiday party in San Bernardino, California. Concern is greater among those living in cities compared to those in the suburbs or rural areas. A third of Americans say that in the wake of recent mass shootings, they are less likely to attend large public events. This figure jumps to six in ten among those most concerned about a mass shooting in their area. More women than men say they are less likely to attend large events as a result of recent mass shootings. This poll was conducted by telephone December 3-5, 2017 among a random sample of 1,120 adults nationwide.  Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA.  Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

News By Yaron Steinbuch Submit December 22, 2017 | 9:06am				| Updated December 22, 2017 | 10:12am Las Vegas killer Stephen Paddock blew himself away with a gunshot into the mouth after he slaughtered 58 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, according to a coroner’s report. According to Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg, none of the victims killed at an outdoor concert Oct. 1 was trampled to death while trying to escape the festival grounds. Some survivors have described receiving injuries other than gunfire during their escapes. Most of those killed died from a single gunshot wound, according to the coroner’s office. Four victims sustained multiple gunshot wounds. Twenty-one people were shot in the head, 36 died with chest and back wounds and one — Rocio Guillen of Corona, California — died of a gunshot to the leg, according to a chart the coroner released. Guillen, a 40-year-old mother of four, made it to a hospital with her fiance, Chris Jaksha, just before she died, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Jennifer Parks, 36, a kindergarten teacher from Palmdale, California, died from multiple gunshot wounds to the head. The off-duty police officer killed at the festival, Charleston Hartfield, 34, died from a gunshot wound to the chest. Officials have said more than 500 people were injured when Paddock, 64, a high-stakes video poker gambler, sprayed gunfire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of 22,000 people at the Route 91 Harvest Festival below. When police stormed Paddock’s suite after he stopped firing, they discovered shell casings all over the floor. “My initial scan, coming in the room with my rifle, is just seeing, I’m seeing one male down, bleeding from the face,” said Officer Matthew Donaldson. “He was not a threat. Kept going, kept going, kept going.” Federal and local authorities have not said publicly what they think motivated Paddock to amass an arsenal of assault-style weapons and ammo.

313,http://www.ibtimes.com/sandy-hook-parents-fight-against-gun-violence-5-years-after-mass-shooting-2628161,"Newtown, Connecticut, looks a lot like every other town in New England, and on the surface, nothing belies that it was home to one of the most brutal massacres in U.S. history. Yet, five years ago, a gunman went into the town’s Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 20 children and six teachers. In the wake of the massacre, parents decided that they needed to help stop tragedies like theirs from happening to other people. “I very soon after realized I had a responsibility and accepted this mission to devote the rest of my life to do everything that I can to prevent that from happening to another family, to prevent another family from having to live this pain,” Mark Barden told International Business Times. “At the end of the day, we were looking for a way that we could be effective. We just wanted to save lives.” Barden lost his son Daniel, who was only 7-years-old. Barden, along with some of the other parents who lost their children, founded Sandy Hook Promise, a non-profit organization aimed a curbing gun violence. Nicole Hockley serves as one of the founding directors of Sandy Hook Promise. She lost her son Dylan, who was six. “Newtown is at the epicenter of the massive ripple effect that’s come out of the shooting at Sandy Hook School,” Hockley told IBT. “We already had our tragedy. Our job is to prevent it from happening elsewhere.” The organization released a public service video this week titled “Tomorrow’s News.” It depicts a local news report detailing a shooting set to happen at a school the next day. It urges people to look for signs of a potential school shooting and to report them.  “We’re a little bit more educated here in Newtown in terms of what these tragedies feel like and why we don’t want them to happen elsewhere."" said Hockley. ""So, a lot of our programs are focused on everywhere outside of Newtown."",” said Hockley. Another organization that grew out of the Newtown shooting was Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense. Its founder, Shannon Watts, was horrified by the shooting. “I’m a mom of five and I was so outraged and so angry and so sad, that I felt I had to do something,” Watts told IBT. “And what happened was, so many women and moms had the exact same idea that day. And in the following weeks and months, we grew from an online conversation to an offline movement.” Hockley said that the goal of their organization is to help prevent gun violence upstream, before people ever pick up a gun. They feel in some way they have gained traction. Since the group’s inception seven states, including Connecticut, have passed laws that have made more stringent background checks for purchasing guns. In other ways, they feel discouraged. “With increasing frequency, we see these horrendous mass shootings happening. And yeah, it feels, I feel defeated. I feel discouraged, I feel profound sadness for those families, because I know what it feels like,” said Hockley. In the past few months alone, two of the deadliest mass shootings in recent United States history have occurred. On Oct. 1, a gunman killed 58 people and injured more than 500 when he opened fire at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas.The shooter, in that case, used a “bump stock,” which modifies a one bullet per trigger-pull rifle to shoot faster. Several congressmen promised national legislation on the modification, but none has come. Some states have taken up the action themselves. On Nov. 5, a shooter walked into First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and gunned down 26 people including a pregnant woman and baby who was 1 and a half. As of November this year, there have been 1,552 mass shootings, with at least 1,767 people killed since Sandy Hook, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive compiled by Vox. A mass shooting defined as four or more people, not including the shooter, shot in the same general location and time. Watts said that their advocacy is often misunderstood by people who think they want to take their guns away. She said the National Rifle Association (NRA), a guns lobbying group, has bred mistrust. “We are not anti-gun, but we are definitely anti-NRA lobbyist,” said Watts. “And the gun lobby has really cultivated these gun extremists. They’ve made them really afraid that their guns are going to get taken away...erroneously, no one is trying to take anyone’s guns away. But you know, women and moms, we’re afraid our children are going to get taken away.” Despite the resistance and setbacks, Barden believes that they have already made an impact. “The work that we’re doing at Sandy Hook promise is saving lives. I have to remind myself that we have prevented school shootings,” he said. The NRA had not yet responded to IBT's request for comment. Lynn and Christopher McDonnell, the parents of seven-year-old Grace McDonnell, grieve near Sandy Hook Elementary after learning their daughter was one of 20 school children and six adults killed after a gunman opened fire inside the school in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, 2012. A heavily armed gunman opened fire on school children and staff at a Connecticut elementary school on Friday, killing at least 26 people, including 20 children, in the latest in a series of shooting rampages that have tormented the United States this year.

The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Virginia on Friday in cooperation with former Arizona Democratic congresswoman and shooting victim Gabby Giffords’ gun control advocacy group. The cities are seeking a court order to monitor compliance with reporting requirements that the Pentagon in recent weeks has acknowledged it has failed to comply with for years. Two separate military investigations — one by the Air Force and one by the Department of Defense Inspector General — recently found the failure to share the data is systemic across the military branches, in some cases a full third of the time. The reviews were undertaken in November after a former airman, David Kelley, shot to death 26 people — including an unborn baby — in a Texas church. Kelley had been convicted in a military court of domestic violence, but his case was never reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which would have prevented him from buying a gun. The complaint states that “twenty-six innocent people were murdered and twenty others wounded, in a Texas church in a mass shooting that could, and should, have been prevented. ... Had Defendants simply followed the law, that shooter never should have been able to purchase the weapon he used.” “No new laws are required to achieve that goal,” it adds. “Instead, this Court need only grant Plaintiffs’ request to compel Defendants to diligently implement, and consistently apply, the unambiguous laws that have been on the books for decades.” The lawsuit names as defendants Defense Secretary James Mattis; the secretaries of the Air Force, Navy, and Army; and the heads of the military branches’ criminal investigation arms. Both the Pentagon and Department of Justice declined to comment on the case Tuesday. But a Justice Department spokeswoman, Lauren Ehrsam, pointed out that Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a separate review of his own in November and is determined to “work with the Department of Defense to identify and resolve any issues with the military’s reporting of convictions.” Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

Those bringing the new lawsuit, however, said the court must step in to ensure the necessary changes are implemented. “The horrific mass shooting in Sutherland Springs made all too clear the devastating consequences that can follow when known dangerous people are able to pass background checks and acquire guns,” Adam Skaggs, chief counsel for Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a statement. “For two decades the Department of Defense was aware of the fact that it was failing to report unacceptably high numbers of disqualifying records to the FBI.” The group complains the GOP Congress, which is considering legislation to address the problem in the form of the proposed Fix NICS Act, has dragged its feet. “This is why we’re now going to the courts,” Skaggs added. “After twenty years of failure, outside monitoring by the courts is clearly necessary to guarantee that the reporting failures that led to the Texas church shooting never happen again.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

Oct. 3, 2017: Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, left, responds to a question as Aaron Rouse, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Las Vegas Division, looks on during a media briefing at the Las Vegas Metro Police headquarters in Las Vegas, Nev. (Reuters) Want to finally know why Stephen Paddock gunned down 58 people in Las Vegas in early October? Be prepared to wait a while – possibly until next October – the chief of the FBI’s Las Vegas office revealed this week during an interview in which he said the agency probably wouldn't brief the public until their report is released sometime before the tragedy’s first anniversary. “Now that’s a long time for some people, but speaking for the FBI, that’s light speed, all right?” Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Wednesday. Rouse said reports from other agencies investigating the mass shooting will be released at different times, but the FBI’s one is “focusing a large part on the why” which is “what everybody wants to know.” In this Oct. 3, 2017, file photo, personal belongings and debris litters the Route 91 Harvest festival grounds across the street from the Mandalay Bay resort and casino in Las Vegas.
      (AP) That burning question has not been answered, but Rouse said evidence still suggests Paddock was the only person involved in the attack and that he has not been linked with any affiliations or ideologies. The FBI previously denied claims by the Islamic State that Paddock was responding to a call to intensify attacks against Western countries bombing its territories in Syria and Iraq. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joe Lombardo has said in the past that Paddock’s mounting gambling losses may have played a role. “As I sit here today, I believe that we are learning as much as we possibly can about why the subject did what they did,” Rouse said. LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS ALL DIED OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS, CORONER'S REPORT FINDS Rouse told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the FBI has interviewed around 400 people worldwide in connection to Paddock and has brought in the same number of specialists to help document evidence. He said the Route 91 Harvest music festival site took investigators 14 days to comb over, while Paddock’s room and hotel hallway at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino took 13. Important items found at both sites have been sent to the FBI's central lab in Virginia. “We’re going to have, I think, the best digital schematic of what happened and where it happened and how it happened that you can come up with,” Rouse said. He added that FBI investigators have 22,000 hours of surveillance and cellphone footage and 250,000 photos to look over, amounting to about 40 terabytes of data. “We didn’t leave anything uncovered,” Rouse told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “And again, the casinos, with their support, let us track down a lot of information of who may have had contact with that person. And it was very helpful to us.” Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

316,https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-mexico-school-shooter-had-secret-life-on-pro-trump-white-supremacy-sites?source=twitter&via=desktop,"SEARCH For years before William Edward Atchison killed two students and himself, he lived a shadow life online—one full of crude alt-right memes and praise for school shooters. In real life, William Edward Atchison—people called him Bill—lived in a little yellow house with his parents, about a mile away from the Giant gas station where he worked and from Aztec High School, where he shot and killed two students and then himself last Thursday. At the murder scene, police found a thumb drive with a note that read, “If things go according to plan, today would be when I die. I go somewhere and gear up, then hold a class hostage and go apeshit, then blow my brains out.” He wrote “work sucks, school sucks, life sucks. I just want out of this shit.” “It’s a shame he wasn’t on our radar,” San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen told Fox News last week. “I don’t think he had anything so much as a traffic ticket.” And yet online, the 21-year-old New Mexico resident lived a prolific life as a white supremacist, pro-Trump meme peddler who was most known for his obsession with school shooters. For a half-decade, Atchison spent most of his days online, repeatedly posting threats of violence and cries for help. When users saw posts from Atchison, who went by dozens of names like “Adam Lanza” and “Future Mass Shooter” on both larger platforms like YouTube and racist communities like The Daily Stormer, they would often ask how his manifesto was going. Despite local law enforcement’s claims that he wasn’t a known threat, and a visit from the FBI in 2016, Atchison spent most of the last half-decade glorifying school shooters on alt-right websites and posting plaintive appeals for help in fixing his life, according to hundreds of posts analyzed by The Daily Beast. At EncyclopediaDramatica, a Wikipedia-style site for fringe internet users to describe memes and in-jokes in detail, he volunteered as a SysOp, the site’s word for an administrator. Atchison’s page, now replete with his screen name @satanicdruggie and his real identity, is filed under the “An Heroes” section, reserved for people who have killed themselves. On the alt-right forums and hate groups he frequented, Atchison appears to have made many enemies. Despite later becoming a moderator of the site, one of Atchison’s most popular EncyclopediaDramatica accounts, AlGore, was banned from the site for two years when it was labeled as a “troll.” And in the run-up to the 2016 election, EncyclopediaDramatica users excoriated Atchison for abusing his powers as a SysOp of the site. Users were upset he was appending too many pro-Columbine shooting memes and “shitty facebook commentaries” praising Donald Trump on the site’s home page. In the thread, as it often did with discussions about Atchison’s last account @satanicdruggie, the conversation invariably turned back to his obsession with school shootings. “Do you fantasize about shooting up the bullies at your school?” one user asked. “Yah i remember him literally bragging about being *obsessed* with Columbine,” a user responded. “In 2016.” “Have you completed your manifesto yet?” another asked. Atchison even spread his affinity for school shootings and Nazi ideology in more sanitized parts of the web. On Steam, an online video game store and community, Atchison used the reviews section to criticize Wolfenstein games, which are set in World War II-era Germany. “I find this game highly offensive for featuring mass murder against your own race,” he wrote. In another review, he simply wrote, “RIP Hitler.” In a review of Doom II, Atchison referred to the Columbine shooting as “LOLumbine.” His review for the game Hatred, a game which was initially pulled from Steam because the main character’s goal is to “slaughter innocents,” simply reads “ur going to ALL pay.” And his recent posts reflected what seems to be a migration from trolling to honest espousal of an extreme right-wing political ideology. In November, Atchison wrote on Steam, “How am I supposed to function in this world? Wherever I go, I see degeneracy. Pointless materialism, hedonism, sexual decay, dirty n**gers who do nothing but slowly break down this society etc. it’s fucking everywhere. No way to escape it, 99% of people are part of it and whatever I do I am confronted with the death of the West. Go to the store and buy groceries in peace? Nope, here’s a group of LGBT liberal filth in line with you. And there’s a n**ger family with 10 kids over there. And a Finn too, but he’s overweight as fuck and he’s buying alcohol and shit junk food. Fucking fantastic. “I used to think that this was a phase and we’d get over it, but I have now come to realize that I was born into a literal dystopia.” On Kiwi Farms, a forum that describes itself as a place for “gossip and exploitation of the mentally handicapped for amusement purposes,” Atchison frequently posted commemorations of mass shooters. Two days before his own school shooting, under his username “Fuck You,” Atchison posted an explicit sexual reply endorsing Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath, a failed mass shooter from Halifax, Nova Scotia. (Atchison used a photo of Kiwi Farms administrator Josh Moon as his profile picture for Steam.) On YouTube, Atchison admitted he posted anonymously on pro-Trump, white-supremacist sites like 4chan’s /pol/ board or The Daily Stormer, but gave up when domain registrars kept shutting down The Daily Stormer’s domain names. He, along with most of The Daily Stormer’s community, said the sites were “shoa’d,” an anti-Semitic slur. “[I’m] on different youtube channels, anonymous posts on the chans, or my work on ED,” he said. “Formerly DS before it got shoa’d and I’m too lazy to get TOR again﻿.” Atchison had also posted on Blockland.us, a forum for the Minecraft-like multiplayer video game, since 2014. His more than 40 usernames were meant to offend. Almost all were racist or violent by design. Several were modeled after school shooters, including Cho Seung-Hui, Omar Mateen, Adam Lanza, Elliot Rodger, and Anders Breivik. He also went by “School Shooter” and “Future Mass Shooter.” Ryan Lenz, who monitors hate groups and extremism for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Atchison’s pattern is typical of white extremists—even if his years-long archive of school-shooting proclamations might be unprecedented. “Generally, mass shooters spend a period of time prior to their action steeped in studying previous shooters. They study the aftermath of these individuals. They have a great deal of esteem or respect for others who have done the same,” said Lenz. “Add in the ideology, in this case these forums—it compounds the severity and the rate of radicalization.” Lenz said the cocktail of violent rhetoric, mental illness, and economic despair is what leads to “mobilization,” the word experts use for the shift from radicalized online rhetoric to real-life behavior. “What we’ve found with these ideologies is that they repeatedly lead to violence. There’s a dual line of radicalization happening,” said Lenz. “To steep yourself in Daily Stormer rhetoric and the sites like it is to put yourself in the headspace of where the violence is when not if.” In his final days, Atchison used “Sam Hyde” as his display name, the name alt-right users on websites like 4chan and Twitter employ in an effort to dupe the media into sharing false information after mass shootings. “The internet has changed a lot of things. Make it much easier for an alienated, isolated kid to find communities where they feel they belong,” said Lenz. “And it sometimes goes unchecked because of how the alt-right has presented itself: It’s just irony. It’s for the lulz.” On EncyclopediaDramatica, Atchison also appears on the entry for Bob8466, or Carter Boyles of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a 15-year-old who shot and killed himself at his high school on Sept. 11, 2016. Atchison, who called himself a friend of Boyles on YouTube and the video game site Steam, wrote the Bob8466 EncyclopediaDramatica entry after the Iowa teen’s suicide. “It is believed that [Boyles] was calmly talked down from going postal, instead unfortunately choosing to take his own life and becoming an [sic] hero to us all,” Atchison wrote under the username AlGore. Like Atchison, Boyles was active on Steam and on YouTube, where he posted videos of simulated school shootings. In Boyle’s final video, a first-person walkthrough of the school where he shot himself, online acquaintances gathered to post comments in memoriam. “Suicides are ignored,” Atchinson wrote, under the name Vance Stone. “Suicidal people who commit mass murder, however, get the entire world’s attention, garner thousands of fans / fangirls, become a household name and become celebrities. “His action of suicide was tragic and it’s a shame he had to go out like that, because he was pretty damn cool when I chatted to him.” Boyle wasn’t Atchison’s only school-shooter friend, according to “Smith,” a YouTuber from Texas who considered Atchison a friend. Smith’s channel, “Aesthetic Autism,” features mostly footage of war synced to music, and he recorded but has not released a podcast with the New Mexico murderer. Smith told The Daily Beast that Ali Sonboly, the teenager who shot and killed nine people in a Munich McDonald’s last year, was also a member of the Steam group that he and Atchison started, called the Anti-Refugee Club. (Smith claims the group—which was taken down two months ago—wasn’t racist but “mostly satire.”) “[Atchison] wasn’t alt-right. He wasn’t a neo-Nazi,” Smith said in a direct message. “Bill hated both sides... His emotions mixed with his politics. “He was edgy, he was offensive, and he was shocking. He said a lot out of pure shock, but I didn’t think he’d be so moronic enough to do what he did,” Smith said. That shocking content brought the FBI to Atchison’s door in 2016. Acting on a tip that Atchison had posted a comment on a gaming forum asking users where he could get “a cheap assault rifle” for a mass shooting, the FBI interviewed him and his family, and ultimately determined that no crime had been committed and closed the investigation. “He was cooperative,” Albuquerque FBI Special Agent Terry Wade said at a press conference last week. “He told us that he enjoyed trolling on the internet. “The agents specifically asked him if he had plans about conducting attacks and expressed the seriousness that we take these type of things. He assured us that he had no such plans,” Wade said. Atchison described the visit on his YouTube channel, writing in a comment, “I was part of the trolling and lulz... the feds investigated me cus some fag reported my profile to troll me... they said they didn’t think I was a serious threat and understood the satire…” The Daily Beast reached out to Agent Wade about Atchison’s online behavior. Wade’s spokesperson referred a reporter to the San Juan County sheriff and said the FBI wouldn’t have further comment on the case at this time. Brice Current, a captain at San Juan County Sheriff’s Office, said they were just beginning to process the crime scene and Atchison’s home, at which they confiscated his computer and Xbox 360. As for a motive, Current could only speculate. “We don’t have a motive other than it was planned,” Current said. “He obviously did something in his life where he came up with this plan and idea and went through with it. Online gaming, or the people he associated with, or what. This was his plan and I don’t know, I don’t know. I really don’t think he had a motive other than to be famous in that world, whatever world that is.” Despite building up a reputation for trolling on forums like EncyclopediaDramatica, Atchison took to other platforms like LiveJournal in a sincere search for someone who would hear his cries for help. On the website Think Atheist, Atchison titled his sole post “Stuck in a Rural Redneck Town” in September 2014. “I don’t want to be lame or anything but I should probably come out about all this,” he wrote. Under the name Demetrius Alcala, Atchison outlines his floundering career and social life in rural New Mexico. He applied to fast-food restaurants and dollar stores and was rejected. He hadn’t had friends since childhood, when two people took advantage of him after he loaned them video-game consoles that were sold or weren’t given back. He had a 3.5 GPA, he said, but dropped out in 10th grade because of anxiety and the “backwards as hell” culture at school. He says he tried to go back but dropped out again, citing his abusive family. He called his father a “fat lazy idiot who watches fox news all day” and his mother “a psycho hillbilly drunk from florida who’s really mentally ill.” Two years before the FBI visited his home, and three years before he killed two people in a New Mexico high school, Atchison pleaded for advice on how to fix his life. “Look, I’m sorry if I’m rude and hateful or anything, but I don’t know what to do. I’ve lived no life for nearly 19 years, most of which was in the miserable ass sun-belt. Did you know new mexico has the fourth highest suicide rate?” Atchison wrote. “Should I escape this dump or deal with it? How can I become polite and make some friends out there in this world?” Over 230 people viewed the post.

Blood seeped from bullet wounds, his near an elbow, hers on the head. Panicked concertgoers streamed past them. David Hendrickson, an EMT who attended the Oct. 1 concert, stopped and knelt beside the couple. The woman was growing woozy. Blood soaked through the shirt tied around her head. Hendrickson tightened it, and then took off his own shirt and tied it around the man’s arm. “We need to get these guys to the hospital,” Hendrickson told his girlfriend, Michelle Wolters. There was no time to wait for an ambulance. The four climbed into Wolters’ Mercedes. Blood seeped into the leather seats. More: Was Reno high-rise gunman mimicking Las Vegas shooter 2 months ago?

They had driven in from California and nobody in the car knew the local hospitals, so Wolters pulled out her iPhone. With shaking fingers, she typed in ""Vegas hospital."" Sunrise Hospital appeared at the top of the list. “All right,” Hendrickson said, “we’re gonna go there.” They had no way to know that Sunrise would soon become overwhelmed with patients, with every gurney full and ""red-tag"" triage patients waiting for care. At the same time, the county’s most comprehensive trauma center, University Medical Center, barely three miles away, was preparing itself for victims who never arrived. Metropolitan Las Vegas has a trauma response plan designed to send manageable numbers of patients to each hospital. The plan dictates which injuries must be treated at a trauma center and which ones can go to a regular hospital. It splits Clark County into three areas and assigns each one a trauma center where patients should be taken. The Route 91 Harvest festival stage was at a location designated for UMC. But in the hours after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, that plan became impossible to follow. Bystanders like Hendrickson and Wolters loaded victims into their cars and drove them to the first hospital they could find, bypassing the county's transport system entirely. More: Las Vegas shooting lawsuits stack up with 14 more filed More: Jason Aldean remembers 'pandemonium' during Las Vegas shooting Confusion and rumors swirled, partly because the county lacks the central communications system that emergency planners called for in 2009. That resulted in an uneven rush of patients into hospitals all over Clark County. Sunrise, a Level II trauma center, treated 199 patients in a few hours. UMC, Nevada’s only Level I trauma center and the hospital President Trump visited after the massacre, took 104 patients. A handful of UMC's beds remained empty as rumors it had closed it doors spread through the county. Hundreds more patients filtered into smaller hospitals. “Some places got hit hard,” said UMC trauma director Dr. John Fildes. “But that’s what happens when 500 people went down.”  City, county and hospital officials insist their response to the shooting went as smoothly as possible. “From an emergency response perspective, the event was very professionally managed,” Clark County Fire Chief Greg Cassell said in a statement. No complaints have been filed with the state’s health department, and a spokeswoman for the Division of Public and Behavioral Health said she was not aware of any complaints about the emergency response. “If it’s a problem, it needs to be addressed,” said John Hammond, the EMS and trauma system manager for the Southern Nevada Health District, about the imbalance of patients at hospitals. “But I don’t know if it’s a problem.” More: Couple who survived Las Vegas mass shooting die in car crash More: 'Is this real?': Seven hours of chaos, bravery at Las Vegas hospital after mass shooting Among the unanswerable questions from a night of terror is whether the Level I trauma center should have received more patients, potentially spreading the work more evenly among over-burdened emergency workers. The drop in care from a Level I to a Level II trauma center is minimal, experts say, and often disputed. Nationwide studies of their treatment have given mixed results. Some research shows that more people die at Level II centers, which aren’t required to have as many specialists or treat as many patients annually as top-tier centers. Other research shows more people die at Level I centers, because those places receive the patients closest to death. It’s impossible to know if the confusion caused any patients to receive lesser treatment. But it at least created disparate levels of chaos at the region’s two largest trauma centers. At Sunrise, the flow of patients seemed never to stop. Staff, space and resources ran thin. The hospital used up its entire supply of universally compatible O-negative blood, and at least one ER doctor said he worked until his brain couldn’t process charts anymore. Every gurney and wheelchair in the hospital held a patient. Some patients waited on the floor. Others with minor injuries walked out, not wanting to take up time or resources that could be used on more critical patients. A few miles away, UMC’s trauma director wondered where the rest of the patients were. Around 1:45 a.m. MT, Fildes counted nine empty trauma bays. Three operating rooms sat open. Even two months after the shooting, nobody has determined exactly why patients stopped arriving at UMC. But in the immediate aftermath, rumors spread by word of mouth and on social media that UMC had closed its doors. Multiple emergency workers and hospital staffers told The Arizona Republic they heard, at some point during the evening, that UMC had stopped taking patients. Representatives of two ambulance companies heard it. Two Sunrise staffers said they heard it. Two medics working at the concert venue received texts about it. None of those people could identify the source of the rumor. ""So many injuries that UMC hospital having to divert to other hospitals,"" Las Vegas blogger Christy Oldenkamp wrote on Twitter. Other accounts tweeted similar rumors. It wasn’t true. UMC didn’t close, and nothing similar appears in an audio recording of Clark County Fire Department dispatchers in the first hour after the shooting. Fildes, the UMC trauma director, recalled telling somebody at Sunrise that he had room to take their excess patients. He remembered asking for them to come three at a time, so his teams could focus on the most critical patients. In an email, Fildes said he couldn't remember how many more arrived.  The Southern Nevada Health District’s trauma plan, last updated in February 2015, dictates that a patient must be taken to a trauma center if he or she has certain injuries, including a “penetrating injury to the head, neck, torso or the extremities proximal to the elbow or knee.” It then divides Clark County into three segments: Trauma patients injured in an eastern area should be taken to Sunrise, which is northeast of the Strip. Patients in an area to the south should go to St. Rose Dominican Hospital, Siena Campus, in nearby Henderson. Patients found anywhere else in the county go to UMC, which is northwest of the Strip. The Route 91 concert stage was in a part of the county for which UMC was responsible. The plan allows for exceptions if bad traffic or dangerous weather make the designated hospital too difficult to reach in time. It's designed to make first responders, ambulance drivers and other emergency personnel work in unison, all following the same strategy to move people to hospitals. It does not mention how to handle a mass of gunshot victims being transported in pickup trucks and strangers’ back seats. So when it came time for the plan to be implemented, confusion ruled the moments after the shooting. Emergency responders weren’t sure if it was safe to head toward the festival grounds. False reports of multiple shooters circulated. One man on the Clark County Fire Department dispatch radio kept repeating reports of a man in Army fatigues climbing into a van. Through it all, audio recordings obtained by The Arizona Republic show, the dispatch feed flooded with requests for ambulances. “The ambulances do not have enough units to transfer all the gunshot wounds,” one responder reported. “We are out of ambulances and we still have a couple more criticals,” said another. “Chief, we’re currently loading patients into private vehicles. We have no more ambulances,” still another said. “We’re getting pickup trucks full of patients coming in."" In 2009, a study of the region's trauma plan concluded that Clark County needed a centralized communications center to handle emergency situations, rather than relying on a patchwork system of dispatchers and hospitals. That center was never created. “We’ve been trying to fix that problem for a while,” the health district's Hammond said recently, noting that the initial set-up of a system could cost upward of $1 million. “Not just for large events, but for everyday movement of patients within the system, a centralized system would be better.” The streets were jammed when Hendrickson pulled his girlfriend’s car off the Strip. He and Wolters tried to introduce themselves to the strange couple in their back seat, searching for some way into a conversation. The man said his name was David, too. That was a start. He introduced his girlfriend as Stephanie. Her alertness started to fade. They reached a red light. Hendrickson blew through it. A truck filled with bleeding people sped past them, clambering over the median and through a turn lane. A six-mile drive took 10 minutes. Finally Hendrickson pulled into the curve behind Sunrise’s emergency room. Hospital staff had filled the ambulance bays with as many wheelchairs and gurneys as they could find. An ER doctor and nurses worked in a hurried quiet. A small group crowded around the Mercedes. “Back seat,” Hendrickson told them. He and Wolters watched as nurses pulled out the couple and helped them onto gurneys. Then they disappeared into the crowded hospital. ""We’ve been trying to look for them and see if they’re OK,"" Wolters said recently. ""It does kind of bother us that we don’t know how they are.""

Sandy Hook: Five years later, victims' families find new purpose — -- Six years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, here is a look back at the 20 children and six educators who lost their lives that day. Charlotte Bacon, 6 Charlotte dreamed of being a veterinarian when she grew up. The 6-year-old ""never met an animal she didn't love,"" read her obituary. The lively first-grader also enjoyed practicing taekwondo with her brother, Guy, and her father. ""Charlotte was an extraordinarily gifted 6-year-old who filled her family each day with joy and love. The family will forever remember her beautiful smile, her energy for life and the unique way she expressed her individuality, usually with the color pink,"" read her obituary. Daniel Barden, 7 Daniel was the youngest of three children, his family said in a statement. The family described Daniel as ""fearless in the pursuit of happiness in life."" ""Words really cannot express what a special boy Daniel was. Such a light. Always smiling, unfailingly polite, incredibly affectionate, fair and so thoughtful towards others, imaginative in play, both intelligent and articulate in conversation: in all, a constant source of laughter and joy,"" the family added. Rachel D'Avino, 29 Rachel D'Avino was a behavioral therapist who had only recently started working at Sandy Hook Elementary School, her friend Lissa Lovetere Stone told The Associated Press. Police told her family that D'Avino shielded one of the students during the rampage, Lovetere Stone told the AP. Olivia Engel, 6 The 6-year-old was just learning the rosary and would lead the family in grace every night before dinner, The New Haven Register reported. Her favorite colors were pink and purple. ""She was a great big sister and was always very patient with her 3-year-old brother, Brayden,"" her cousin John Engel told the paper. ""Her father said she was a 6-year-old who had a lot to look forward to."" Josephine Gay, 7 Josephine Gay ""was known for her love of all things purple,"" read her obituary, which asked those who attended her funeral to wear the color in her honor. ""She lived seven years, inspiring friends and family with her beautiful smile, loving heart and playful spirit,"" read her obituary, which also said that family and friends described her as ""a gift."" Dylan Hockley, 6 ""Everyone who met Dylan fell in love with him. His beaming smile would light up any room, and his laugh was the sweetest music. He loved to cuddle, play tag every morning at the bus stop with our neighbors, bounce on the trampoline, play computer games, watch movies, the color purple, seeing the moon and eating his favorite foods, especially chocolate. He was learning to read and was so proud when he read us a new book every day. He adored his big brother Jake, his best friend and role model,"" his family wrote on a website started in his honor. Dylan had special needs, his parents wrote, and he died in the arms of his aide, Anne Marie Murphy. The family praised Murphy, principal Dawn Hochsprung, psychologist Mary Sherlach and his teacher Victoria Soto for truly knowing him. All four educators died in the massacre. Madeleine Hsu, 6 According to her obituary, Madeleine was a ""shy, quiet little girl who loved dogs."" ""She was just an absolute doll,"" a neighbor, Karen Dryer, told The Associated Press. ""She seemed very shy, but she was just so sweet."" Catherine Hubbard, 6 Catherine Hubbard was ""a beautiful child who will be remembered for her love of all animals, her beautiful red hair and her constant smile,"" read the website of the foundation that was started in her honor. Chase Kowalski, 7 ""Chase was an amazing son, brother and grandson [whose] heart was only filled with love for all the people he touched,"" read his obituary. ""Chase loved to read and write, he would go for little hikes in the yard and find feathers and tape them in a journal and write his letters on the pages trying to describe the items,"" his family wrote on the website of the foundation started in his memory. He loved to run from an early age, his family said. Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, 47 Hochsprung was the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School and, by all accounts, was devoted to her students and teachers. ""Dawn was a dedicated teacher who inspired her students to reach their fullest potential by instilling in them the importance of life-long learning. A fierce leader and educational activist, Dawn was admired by her colleagues, students and parents, particularly for her caring and nurturing nature. She often referred to her students as her 'children' and wanted school to be a positive place and a safe haven,"" read her obituary. ""When we had our orientation, you could tell she loved her job,"" Brenda Lediski, a parent, told ABC News in 2012. Jesse Lewis, 6 ""Jesse McCord Lewis was an amazing child, full of light and love that was unmistakable in his presence. He brought joy to the world with his infectious and radiant smile,"" read his obituary, which said he died trying to save other children. ""If you met Jesse once, he would leave an indelible mark on your heart,"" his obituary stated. ""The picture that remains etched in our souls is one of him in his boots, no socks, ripped jeans and a t-shirt, an army helmet strapped to his head, a smudge of dirt on his cheek, tromping through the pasture on his way from one adventure to another."" Ana Marquez-Greene, 6 Ana, the daughter of a jazz musician, loved music, according to her obituary. ""Ana's love for singing was evident before she was even able to talk. In a musical family, her gift for melody, pitch and rhythm stood out remarkably. She never walked anywhere! Her mode of transportation was dance. She danced from room to room and place to place. She danced to all the music she heard, whether in the air or in her head,"" her obituary stated. James Mattioli, 6 ""An energetic, loving friend to all, James loved baseball, basketball, swimming, arm wrestling and playing games on the iPad,"" read his obituary. ""He loved to wear shorts and t-shirts in any weather and grab the gel to spike his hair. He would often sing at the top of his lungs and once asked, 'How old do I have to be to sing on a stage?'"" his obituary stated. ""He loved and admired his big sister and wanted to do everything that she could do. They were the best of friends, going to school together, playing games together and making endless drawings and crafts together."" Grace Audrey McDonnell, 7 The artistic 7-year-old dreamed of living on Massachusetts' Martha's Vineyard and being a painter when she grew up. ""We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support from so many people,"" her family said in a statement in 2012. ""Our daughter Grace was the love and light of our family. Words cannot adequately express our sense of loss."" Anne Marie Murphy, 52 Anne Marie Murphy was employed as a special education teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The devoted mother and teacher died with one of her beloved students, Dylan Hockley, in her arms, Hockley's family said in a statement. ""She will be remembered for her love of the arts, walks in the outdoors and most importantly: her family,"" read her obituary. Emilie Parker, 6 Emilie Parker would have been one of the first to comfort her classmates at Sandy Hook Elementary School, had a gunman's bullets not claimed her life, her father said. ""My daughter Emilie would be one of the first ones to be standing and giving her love and support to all those victims, because that's the type of person that she is,"" her father, Robbie Parker, said after the shooting. ""We find comfort in reflecting on the incredible person Emilie was and how many lives that she was able to touch in her short time here on earth,"" he added. Jack Pinto, 6 ""Jack was an incredibly loving and vivacious young boy, appreciated by all who knew him for his lively and giving spirit and steely determination,"" read his obituary. ""In life and in death, Jack will forever be remembered for the immeasurable joy he brought to all who had the pleasure of knowing him, a joy whose wide reach belied his six short years."" Jack was a fan of New York Giants and their wide receiver Victor Cruz, who paid tribute to the 6-year-old during a game against the Atlanta Falcons in December 2012. Cruz wrote on his cleats, ""Jack Pinto, my hero,"" and ""R.I.P. Jack Pinto,"" ESPN reported. Cruz traveled to Newtown to meet Jack's family. ""When you hear a kid that is such a big fan of you and such a big fan of the Giants and the team, and I was his favorite player, I felt like it was only right that I pay my respects to him and be as comforting to that family as much as I can,"" Cruz told ESPN in 2012. Noah Pozner, 6 ""Noah was an impish, larger-than-life little boy. Everything he did conveyed action and energy through love. He was the light of our family, a little soul devoid of spite and meanness,"" read his obituary. Noah's twin sister, Arielle, who was in another class, survived. Caroline Previdi, 6 ""Caroline was our bright-eyed and cheerful little girl,"" her family wrote on the website of the foundation started in her honor. ""The word that comes to mind when we think about her is 'joyful.' She found delight in the smallest things in life and often exclaimed things like, 'Isn't that wonderful?' We sometimes marveled at her sheer enthusiasm and zest for life. It wasn't difficult for her to elicit smiles from family, friends and even people we passed in a store; her lighthearted nature was contagious."" Jessica Rekos, 6 ""Jessica Rekos was a beautiful 6-year-old girl who made us laugh every single day. She was smart, quick-witted and compassionate,"" her mother, Krista Rekos, wrote on the website of the foundation dedicated to her. She loved to ride horses, her family said, and her family promised to buy her a horse for her 10th birthday. Her mother wrote of the day Jessica was killed, ""As her school bus approached our bus stop on the morning of December 14th, Jessica and I were discussing how to sell Girl Scout Cookies. This would be Jessica's first time selling, and she could not wait for January when we could 'officially' start making phone calls to friends and family. Jessica hopped out of the car as the bus approached and excitedly walked up the bus stairs. She sat in the front seat, looked at me through the window, and smiled and waved as the bus pulled up the hill."" Avielle Richman, 6 ""Avielle had a grand spirit of adventure and was willing to bravely try new things,"" read the website of the foundation her family started in her honor. ""She had no problem transitioning from playing with her dolls to practicing archery in the yard and was happy to go from a kung fu workout with dad to a cooking lesson with mom. Avielle loved music and would sing everything."" ""Avielle was a connoisseur of parks and playgrounds, played soccer and went to summer sports camp (where she was the only girl to enroll), painted and sketched, ran and hiked, enjoyed fishing and — perhaps most of all — riding horses and swimming. Avielle's sense of wonder, inherent in all children, drove her to love the magic of fireflies and all things that glowed."" Lauren Rousseau, 30 Lauren Rousseau worked as a substitute teacher before landing a full-time substitute teaching position at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, The Danbury News-Times reported. For the 30-year-old, it was a dream job. ""It was the best year of her life,"" Teresa Rousseau, Lauren Rousseau Rousseau's mother and a copy editor at the News-Times, told the paper. Mary Sherlach, 56 Sherlach had worked at Sandy Hook Elementary School since 1994 ""doing what she termed 'God's work' by helping children who needed her the most,"" read her obituary. She and her husband, Bill Sherlach, had been married for 31 years and had two adult daughters. ""Mary is remembered as a loving wife and mother and a caring soul who was always there to lend an ear or a shoulder to someone in need,"" her obituary stated. The American Psychological Association published a tribute to Sherlach in 2013. ""Every day that I've known her, she has done everything in her power to take care of children, in ways large and small,"" Bob Lichtenstein, a former colleague of hers, told the APA in 2013. Victoria Soto, 27 Victoria Soto, 27, loved being a teacher, her cousin Jim Wiltsie told ABC News in 2012. She died trying to save children, he said. ""The family was informed that she was trying to shield, get her children into a closet and protect them from harm, and by doing that put herself between the gunman and the children,"" Wiltsie said. ""And that's when she was tragically shot and killed."" ""Her life dream was to be a teacher. And her instincts kicked in when she saw there was harm coming to her students. It brings peace to know that Vicki was doing what she loved, protecting the children,"" he added. ""And in our eyes, she is a hero."" Benjamin Wheeler, 6 ""Ben was an irrepressibly bright and spirited boy whose love of fun and excitement at the wonders of life and the world could rarely be contained,"" read his obituary. ""His rush to experience life was headlong, creative and immediate. He was a devoted fan of his older brother, Nate, and the two of them together filled the house with the noise of four children."" ""He loved the Beatles, lighthouses and the number 7 train to Sunnyside, Queens,"" his obituary stated, and he told his mother before school, ""I still want to be an architect, but I also want to be a paleontologist, because that's what Nate is going to be, and I want to do everything Nate does."" Allison Wyatt, 6 ""Allison was a kind-hearted little girl who had a lot of love to give, and she formed special bonds with most people who spent any amount of time with her. She loved her family and teachers especially, but would often surprise us with random acts of kindness — once even offering her Goldfish crackers to a complete stranger on a cross-country flight,"" her parents wrote on the website of the memorial fund started in her honor. ""She was a sweet, creative, funny, intelligent little girl who had an amazing life ahead of her. Our world is a lot darker now that she's gone, but we have been finding signs of her everywhere and know that she will always be with us,"" her parents added. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-12-14 09:42:47, Remembering the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting victims,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

320,http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/26/frank-ocean-call-me-by-your-name/,"The father in Call Me By Your Name touched audiences with his wisdom, and it seems Frank Ocean could feel the love. “Michael Stuhlbarg is my new dad now and that’s that,” wrote Ocean on Tumblr, as Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan pointed out Monday. Though Stuhlbarg, 49, is having a big moment in theaters — the actor also appears in The Shape of Water and The Post — it’s his role as father to Timothée Chalamet’s Elio that is earning him Oscar buzz for best supporting actor. At a pivotal point in the Luca Guadagnino-directed film, based on André Aciman’s 2007 novel, Stuhlbarg’s character gives a moving speech to Elio, who has fallen in love with Armie Hammer’s Oliver. Ocean, 30, came out about his sexuality on Tumblr in 2012, reflecting on how he had fallen in love with a man. “I feel like a free man,” he penned in part. In the wake of the mass shooting at gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando in June 2016, Ocean shared a personal note that described how his father used a slur to describe a transgender waitress when Ocean was a little boy. “I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f—– as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty,” he wrote. “That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t.

(Here is 2011’s version, and here’s 2012’s, and here’s 2013’s, and here’s 2014’s , and here’s 2015's, and here’s 2016's.) Leitch has written four books. Find more of his business at his Twitter feed and his official site. He also has a weekly newsletter he’d very much appreciate if you subscribed to. It is, as it goes, a day like any other. A family of five rustles around the breakfast table, in a hurry, shoveling food while rushing to get to school, to the office, to the carpool lane. They live in the city of Hamelin, a fictional suburb roughly 90 miles from San Francisco, where the father in the family works. He kisses the kids, flirts and bickers with his wife and sprints out the door with a smiling wave. The five-year-old son spills  milk across the table; the two older kids fight over the television. Carol, the mom, hustles the kids off to school, where she directs the student play — it’s about The Pied Piper this year. (The little mice are very cute.) Grandma and Grandpa are coming to visit from Chicago next Easter. The oldest son is getting better at riding his bike, even uphill. The neighbors down the road have a new baby.  There’s a lot going on, because there is always a lot going on. The Wetherly family in the 1983 film Testament is like every other family, every other person, every regular schmuck just walking around. Their lives are unremarkable and ordinary. They are just trying to go about their day, like anybody else. Later that night, Dad is stuck at the San Francisco office, so the family prepares dinner while the younger kids watch cartoons and squabble. The signal on the television starts to flicker and go grey; the oldest sister frowns and pounds it with her fist. Suddenly, a news anchor appears on the screen. “This is San Francisco,” he says. “We have lost our New York signal. Radar sources confirm the explosion of nuclear devices there, in New York, and up and down the East Coast. Ladies and gentlemen, this is real.” The phone rings. It’s Dad, but only for a second — there is a blinding flash outside the home, followed by air sirens. The line goes dead. The television shuts off. The five-year-old screams “Mom!” The family huddles behind the barcalounger, unsure where else to go. They just put their arms over their heads and hide. The rest of Testament, the most brutal, pitiless, uncompromising movie I have ever seen, consists of everyone gradually dying off. Bombs have landed in every major American city, including San Francisco, and there is no power and no communication with the outside world. At first, the community comes together; there is some looting, but mostly Hamelin pools its resources and tries to help out the most immediately needy. (The Weatherly family takes in a neighbor child whose parents just never came home from San Francisco after he had spent several nights alone waiting for them.) Life attempts to go on in the usual habits, through the usual institutions. School begins again, piano lessons continue, church is still every Sunday morning. The kids’ play goes on, but the parents cannot pretend: They weep throughout as the children look on, puzzled, a little scared. But where else are you going to go? What else can you do but go on? Then life starts to slowly fade away. Ham radios stop being able to pick up signals from outside the city. No one from San Francisco makes it home. And then the babies start getting sick. Then the elderly. The youngest son (played by a six-year-old Lukas Haas) gets out of a bath that he has filled with blood; the next scene is Carol tearing the house apart to find his beloved stuffed bear as his body is wrapped in a sheet outside their home, next to makeshift grave in the front yard. (The graveyards are all full.) Carol’s hair is beginning to fall out in clumps. Her daughter, just entering her teenage years, asks her,coughing and frail, what being in love is like, and what “making love” means. Her answer stops the film. I was so ignorant as a girl. Worried about it. So full of fantasy. I thought some man would come along and sweep me off my feet. And your father, he wasn’t at all what I was looking for. Not the size or shape, or what he did exactly, I still don’t know. When you love someone, you want to be as close to them as you can get. You make love, and you feel almost like the same body. You have a space, and that person fills it up. We would fight. We wouldn’t listen to each other. We’d miss...thoughts. We’d miss goodbyes. But sometimes, most times, there was this feeling, and I couldn’t wait for him to be here with me. Everyone’s always alone. And yet ... there can be this gift. This making of miracles. She smiles sadly for the love she has lost, and her eyes meet her daughter’s, who looks not moved, but angry. “For you, Mom,” she says. “But not for me.” In the next scene, Carol is sewing together a burial shroud for her. There is no wood left for coffins. Not once is there a hint of rescue, or escape, or even hope. There is no resolution but the end of the world. In the film’s final scene, the town is empty except for Carol, her oldest son and a neighbor boy with Down’s Syndrome they’ve brought into their home. They have made a decision. Carol closes the door to her garage. They sit in the car. She starts the engine. After a minute, she turns to her son. “I can’t do it,” she says, and there is the failure of everyone in her voice. But there are no tears. There are none left. They go inside and light a candle on a graham cracker for birthdays that will never come. The neighbor boy has a present. He has found the lost teddy bear. Carol’s heart breaks. “You found it,” she says and smiles for the first time in the film. This is Testament’s happy ending. This is all it has left to give to you. Testament hit theaters in 1983, two weeks before The Day After aired on ABC and terrified the poor Jennings family in The Americans. This was the height of Cold War nuclear paranoia, when President Reagan and various post-Brezhnev Russian leaders made the possible annihilation of the species the lead on every night’s newscast and of day’s every newspaper. This was a time in which any building that had a concrete basement put up FALLOUT SHELTER signs for the public to see, lest they need to locate one immediately. My grade school had them at the front and back entrances. The teachers used to smoke out there with some of the sixth graders, if memory serves. The signs were everywhere you wanted to look. There was reason for this to be a daily part of everyone’s lives. Since U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had instituted American policy of Mutually Assured Destruction in the early ‘60s—the idea that the only way to combat a potential nuclear strike from the enemy (the USSR) was to stockpile enough weapons to let them know that if they attacked us, we’d have no choice but to blow up them, and thus the world, in response—the idea that human life could, theoretically, end any minute was not just a reality, but in fact an official American international strategic initiative. It was just a part of your life, and, inevitably, part of your popular culture, whether it was Rocky Balboa trying to persuade an audience of Russians that if I can change and you can change then everybody can change, or the truly insane 1988 love story Miracle Mile, which ends with Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham ending their first date by sinking into the La Brea Tar Pits while the bombs rain down all among them. Once the Soviet Union fell and the Cold War ended, roughly six years after the release of Testament, the idea of mutually assured destruction almost immediately evaporated from public consciousness as anything other than a joke. It was a collective bullet dodged. The Cold War was over. The USSR had dissolved. There was no logical enemy remaining for the United States. There was no one to shoot a nuke at anymore; why would they shoot a nuke at us? The idea of a mushroom cloud became almost a figment of fun, a silly relic of a time when we were actually scared something like that could happen, a “Now That’s What I Call ‘80s!” time capsule along with Max Headroom, Atari 2600s and Choose-Your-Own-Adventure paperbacks. You could still be affected by a movie like Testament — or The Day After or even Dr. Strangelove — but you couldn’t help but distance yourself from it. I saw Testament about 10 years ago, and while it was still powerful, it couldn’t help but feel a little overheated. It was  serious and sober-minded and even terrifying, but it also played like a reaction to a threat that never came. Watching it felt like reading an article that warned you about the dangers of the Y2K virus, or, more to the point, watching one of those old newsreel nuclear propaganda films from the ‘50s. For a long time, there was a remove when you looked at this era. It was all a bit funny, really, how worried we were back then. There was nothing to be worried about it. Everything was fine. Bullet dodged. You felt smug relief in the distance. You knew something those filmmakers didn’t. You know how this turned out. I will tell you: It is a very different experience to watch Testament right now, in December 2017, with Donald Trump as President and every little failsafe eroding a little bit more every day. It is a lot fucking different. That so many earth-shattering—literally!—events are happening on a daily basis that no person could possibly keep up with all of them has become such a commonplace observation that merely stating it makes you sound like the last guy to know the Roll Safe meme. (Which I’m pretty sure I was.) A guy shoots 600 people from his Vegas hotel room, only the deadliest mass shooting in American history, and three months later not only have we all moved on from it, we don’t even know (or seem to care anymore) why he did it. We appear to have definitive proof that there are aliens and that they have technology that the United States is “incapable of defending itself” against, and I haven’t heard a single person in my life bring this up in conversation in even a passing fashion. It is a tumultuous time. How could it not be? The entire corporate world—which is to say, the entire world—is being rocked daily by stories of predatory, horrific men who have been abusing their leadership positions for decades. The leader of the free world is a unrepentant, almost cheerful racist who seems to have trouble keeping his hands from shaking and saying basic words. The earth itself is the early stages of actively trying to get rid of us. There’s a lot to keep up with. Giancarlo Stanton is on the Yankees now. No reasonable person could possibly keep track of it all, even if they wanted to. But, with all proper  respect to these massive, important stories that are changing the foundation of the world we all live in ... I sort of can’t help but think that maybe we’re not paying quite enough attention to the increasingly real possibility that we all going to die in a nuclear holocaust very soon. Maybe not quite enough? Here are four undeniable facts from this specific moment in history: During the Cold War,  leaders of wealthy, stable, established nations were hinting at nuclear standoffs, and talking about missile defense systems, and testing thermonuclear weapons, and it led to three decades of apocalyptic popular fiction, fallout shelters being installed all across the country and schoolchildren being taught how to shield themselves from debris and radiation in case of a nuclear attack. It was the central organizing principle of most of the second half of the 20th century. It, singularly, affected every aspect of American life. And there were so many more protections then than there are now. Now there are non-state actors who would give any amount of money or human capital to get a hold of a nuclear weapon, of which, from the old Soviet Union, there are thousands of unaccounted for. There is an escalating threat from a desperate nation led by a madman whose only reference point for American life is Dennis Rodman. And there is the doddering cable news addict in the Oval Office who only seems to understand what Brian Kilmeade tells him. And remember: This is Brian Kilmeade. It is difficult to concentrate on this because, well, Christ, look around. But once you start thinking about it, it’s kind of impossible to stop. I am concerned about everything that has been happening on this planet, and the systematic injustice, and the inherent cruelty, and the growing sense that the world is getting a little bit worse every single day. Everything can seem like it is coming apart at the seams. But I hope you will forgive me when I try to aim the focus a little bit on the larger, more existential threat that seems higher than ever. You might think I am being overly dramatic or alarmist about this. You may be right. I very much hope you are right! But, again: Look around. The Doomsday Clock, instituted in 1947 in direct response to  the nuclear age, stood at 17 minutes to midnight in 1991. Days after President Trump’s inauguration, they moved it to 2 1/2 minutes to midnight, and you got the sense from the announcement that they only made it 2 1/2 because it has never been closer than two minutes to midnight, and they wanted to be hopeful. There are thousands of problems in this world that need to be solved. But we are not going to be able to solve them if we are all dead. We can look back at the Cold War and think that maybe they were a little bit too scared back then. After all: No nuclear bombs went off! But I think that they were right, and we were wrong; I think we simply got bored and distracted and we forgot. I think that we are not scared enough. I was eight years old when Testament hit cinemas, just a little bit older than Lukas Haas in the film. I didn’t see it in the theater: It wasn’t until a decade later, on Roger Ebert’s recommendation, that I finally watched it. I wouldn’t have been able to understand it when I was eight. I would just been upset E.T wasn’t in it. But I wonder if my parents watched it. Until I watched it last week, for the first time in many years, I couldn’t have fathomed how my parents — who had an eight-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, two people whom they loved very much and wanted to see grow up and become adult humans with lives and children of their own — could have handled it. These children they loved so much, they ones they protected with an almost feral passion, how could they not think about them when they watched the Wetherly family wilt away and die? When my mother watched Carol’s increased panic when she looked for that bear, did she look at me, still with my favorite blanket, and wonder if she’d someday have to bury it with me? How did my dad feel when he went away on work trips, after watching this movie when one day, randomly, out of nowhere, the world exploded and he wasn’t there with his family? To live in that time and feel like it all going away was a real, vivid possibility ... how did they bear it? I’m legitimately asking. Because unlike every other time I had watched Testament, I am a father now, of two beautiful little boys who are obnoxious and gassy and loud and just about the most incredible things I’ve ever seen in my life. Every day my wife and I look at them and see the boys they are becoming, the men they will someday be, and we are thrilled, we are elated, we are driven near to tears to see them growing up, to learn more every day what they have to offer this planet. I find myself envious of everyone who hasn’t met them yet. You are going to love them, world. I think of what they might be, what they might do, the mistakes they are going to make, the times they get their hearts broken, the hearts they break, the goodness that radiates off them, and I think that maybe they might be the only worthwhile thing I’ve done with my whole stupid life. I can’t wait to see who they become. But Testament warns: Don’t assume the future. It can all be taken away, forever, from everybody. Just because it hasn’t happened before doesn’t mean it can’t happen now. That it hasn’t happened before actually makes it more likely it will happen now. It is a threat, to you, to me, to everybody you love, to everybody I love. There are so many threats, so much danger in the world. But this is the biggest one. It makes you want to run through the streets screaming. It makes you wonder why not everyone is. Toward the end of Testament, the school puts on the Pied Piper play. The bombs have fallen. People have already started dying. There is no word from the outside. There are no longer any illusions as to what is happening. But the play goes on anyway. What else can you do? The youngest son comes out, as the Pied Piper, and gives his closing speech as the Piper. “Your children are not gone,” he says. “They are just waiting for a world that deserves them.” Every parent in the audience sobs. They know what world they’ve given their children, and what it means for all of them. The question is: Do we? All games in the Jamboroo are evaluated for sheer watchability on a scale of 1 to 5 Throwgasms. Five Throwgasms Panthers at Falcons: So, OK! Let’s talk about some football!!!! As always, I’m Will Leitch, I founded this place, I fill in for Drew once a year in this here space. I’m, uh, usually a little lighter than I was up there. Anyway, here’s a fun factoid: I left Deadspin 10 years ago this June. If you remember back when I ran Deadspin, congratulations: You are officially too old to still be reading a sports blog. Anyway, this is the biggest game of the weekend, which is to say, it’s not particularly interesting. When was the last truly great Week 17 moment? Is it still this? Yes, that’s there just to thank Drew for having me again this year. It’s a gift that never goes out of style. Four Throwgasms Bengals at Ravens: I wrote a piece for New York magazine recently about the NFL’s struggles on and off the field this year. This, of course, got the headline “Is This the End of the NFL?” which made me look like someone who is about to give a TED Talk. (To be fair: I do kind of look like I’m going to give a TED Talk.) To the larger point, though: Every year has an uninspired team sneaking into the No. 6 seed — Detroit was the epitome of this last year — but this particular Ravens team becoming that team this years seems fitting in every possible way. Also: I still haven’t quite shaken off this Tweet. Remember, Ray Lewis actually said that above tweet was part of the reason the Ravens never signed Colin Kaepernick. On Inside the NFL. It is so exhausting to follow sports sometimes. Raiders at Chargers: I’m in the middle of a long piece about the Vegas hockey team, and I don’t want to give away too much of it here, but I’ll say this: It is truly surprising how into that hockey team Vegas fans are. It’s not just a bunch of tourists wandering in from the Monte Carlo. They love that team, and have even coalesced a little as a community around them. I couldn’t believe it: The Vegas game I went to (one they lost, even) had as roaring and dedicated a home crowd as any hockey game I’ve seen in years. I highly recommend checking it out. I dunno if it’s going to work like that for the Raiders — there are many reasons to be skeptical — but pro sports in Vegas is much different than I thought it would be. Major downside: Carrot Top does the “welcome to the arena, here are our rules and regulations” video before every game. I know the threshold for entertainment is a little lower in Las Vegas, but ... sheesh . Bills at Dolphins: The Bills are unlikely to make the playoffs now, which is a shame: It would be the most Bills thing ever to end their playoff drought with this lousy irritating team that most of its fans don’t even like. Also: Cardinals at Seahawks: I’m not sure I’ve ever shared this picture before, but this is the last moment my beloved Arizona Cardinals were truly relevant, captured the exact second that my Super Bowl viewing party watched Santonio Holmes’s catch to win Super Bowl XLIII. That photo features every Arizona Cardinals fan to ever step foot in any of the five New York City boroughs. They haven’t let any of us back in since. Three Throwgasms Bears at Vikings: How are the Vikings going to implode this year? They’ve done the missed field goal. They’ve done the monster interception. They’ve done the hail mary thing. I assume this time, Teddy Bridgewater is going to have to come into the NFC Championship Game, and they’re going to be down 21-17 with one second left, and he’s going to run a naked bootleg for a clear path to the endzone, and then his knee is going to buckle again and he’s going to fall short at the one yard line. That would be fun. Would it be worse than this? Say what you will about the NFL, but when was the last time the league made you scream in anguish like that? (Don’t answer that, Falcons fans.) Jets at Patriots: This is a good point, actually. The thing about the NFL is that even its most brutal, painful seasons have often been salvaged by fantastic Super Bowl games. Does the season feel like it’s headed that way this year? Who’s the hero America is behind when they’re trying to beat Tom Brady? Is it Case Keenum? Jared Goff? Here’s to an argument that the only way this season is truly made Worth It is if Drew Brees and the Saints leave Tom Brady crying on the sidelines. Everything else just won’t quite measure up. (Though I find the idea of an Eagles championship compelling. But the idea of the Eagles falling short in crude, brutish fashion even more compelling.) Cowboys at Eagles: Speaking of which. I will confess, with my team not reaching the playoffs, I am cheering for the Eagles. I have many friends from Philadelphia who have suffered with that stupid team for far too long. I’d love to see it happen. Here’s to you, Daulerio. I always think of what Daulerio wrote on this site back in January 2009, right before my Cardinals beat his Eagles in the NFC Championship Game, when we did our “Mayor’ Bet.” He believed in Donovan McNabb back then, that that was the Eagles team they were all waiting for. In retrospect ... Eagles fans have to feel happy that it turned out McNabb wasn’t the guy, right? (It has certainly made this past month less awkward for them. Now they can just disown the guy.) We all need a fill-in playoff team. I’m going with the Eagles. I apologize in advance. Browns at Steelers: Ben Roethlisberger has to retire after this year. Right? How in the world is a guy like that, with his history, going to try push one more year in the public spotlight in the #MeToo era? It is amazing he has skated and remained reasonably popular up to this point. I know it’s football, but seriously. This shit’s gonna end up catching up to Jameis Winston at some point too, you watch. For that matter: It’s sort of amazing that Michael Strahan is on every channel these days, isn’t it? Two Throwgasms Jaguars at Titans: Here is the point when I save you the trouble of trying to pretend I care about the Jaguars — even the good Jaguars — and instead just promote my movie podcast. It is here. Subscribe to it. Our Dorkfest 2017 show is this week. Can you believe we reviewed movies for Deadspin for nearly four years? I have no idea how any of you put up with us so long. Anyway: We’re still plugging away like schmucks at it. Chiefs at Broncos: 2017 has been just as hard, if not harder than 2016, so to keep you sane, I give you once again the video that has provided the most empty and absolutely vital endorphin rush to my brain, just like I did last year. We’re all just trying to make it through however we can, people. 49ers at Rams: I’ve noticed, after seven years of fill-in, that no one ever notices anything that’s below the opening essay. Look, to prove it, here is a picture of me looking like a psychopath. Everyone who is not an Illinois sports fan is looking at that picture thinking, “Jesus Christ, why in the world am I wasting my valuable holiday time looking at this dumbass website? I should go outside.” But every Illini fan is saying, “Jeeezus, how did Leitch get one of those Vitale shirts?” Think I bought one of those at the Mattoon IGA back in 1989. Saints at Buccaneers: Here is an incomplete list of the important NFL figures who attended (or coached at) Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois: Also, Syracuse fans, Dino Babers coached there too. See? Central Illinois isn’t a region that has been left behind by the American promise! One Throwgasm Packers at Lions:I feel like long before we talked about “normalization,” we got used to the star ratings having little sperms chasing a football in this Jamboroo pretty quickly. Texans at Colts: Did anyone ask if it were OK to be alone in a room with Mike Pence’s wife yet? It’s not a situation I anticipate coming up but I want to be prepared just in case. Washington at Giants: I swear, I have heard more about this boring terrible Giants team this year than I have a winning Bengals, Ravens, Texans, Chiefs, Lions or Falcons team ever. The best thing about leaving New York was not having to care about anything New York related if I didn’t want to, ever again. You know how often I’ve had to think about Phil Mushnick in the last four years? Not once! It’s great! It’s pretty wonderful. “Scentless Apprentice (Live and Loud 1993),” Nirvana. Egads. I’m an old dad now, so I can’t pretend I’m not still listening to the same shit I did 20 years ago. But good lord, just out of curiosity, I just googled “Best Rock Songs of 2017.” Here is what came up: There is only one good song there. Maybe two. But probably one. Only old white guys like me and Drew care about rock music anymore, and that’s a good argument for us hurrying up and dying just to get it all over with already. David Johnson, Arizona Cardinals. Because for the first time in the 20-year history of the fantasy league I have run since I worked at The Sporting News Online  in St. Louis, I got the first overall pick this year. I chose my favorite player on my favorite team who just happened to be the consensus overall No. 1 pick. None of those things will ever happen again. And the guy went down Week One. This whole thing is stupid. Is there anything more exciting than a coach losing his job? All year  long, we’ll keep track of which coaches will almost certainly get fired  at year’s end or sooner. And now, your potential 2017 chopping block: Ben McAdoo-FIRED!!! Marvin Lewis-PURSUING OTHER OPPORTUNITIES! Jerry Richardson-FORCED OUT! Chuck Pagano*** John Fox Hue Jackson Jay Gruden Jim Caldwell Todd Bowles Vance Joseph Mike McCarthy Bruce Arians Bill O’Brien Jack Del Rio Dirk Koetter Oh, look Bruce Arians is pulling out the Fake News shit. He’s going to retire, and we all know it, and when he does it, he’ll say he knew all along but just wanted to keep it private and absolutely no one will call him on it. I honestly am embarrassed I used to like Bruce Arians so much. I really think being on the Amazon show broke his brain; it made him feel like such a celebrity he forgot to, you know, actually coach. Pimento cheese! When I inevitably give up and finally quit fighting that my body and genealogy desperately want me to be a fat guy, pimento cheese will be the reason why. Since moving to Georgia, I’ve started putting pimento cheese on everything. Why do people think the Midwest has a monopoly on good fatty cheese? This shit is going to kill me. We all gotta go someday, and somehow. Just a little love for Creature Comforts here in Athens. I still drink shitty American light beer, but if I had any taste or class, this is what I would drink. Wormwood. Disturbing, challenging, punishing and nearly four hours long. It’s like this movie was made specifically for me. Thanks as always to Drew for having me, to Marchman for not deleting this whole thing, to whoever takes over for him next year for hopefully letting me come back and to you for putting up with all this. And seriously, subscribe to that newsletter, I spend way too much time on it. Be safe out there this New Years. May 2018 be better than 2017.

A 21-year-old disguised himself as a student before he walked into a New Mexico high school on Dec. 7 and opened fire, according to reports. William Atchison walked into the Aztec High School bathroom to prepare the assault, the Associated Press reported Friday. He was interrupted by a male student -- who he shot and killed. Police said Atchison fatally shot one more student in the hallway as he fired his gun before he turned it on himself. Atchison was reportedly known to law enforcement officials, but he did not have a criminal record. He also purchased his handgun legally, authorities said. Here’s what we know about Atchison and the shooting so far. Atchison was a former student at small-town Aztec High School. Authorities said the shooter did not have a criminal record. The only contact with law enforcement was what they described as a generic message on an online gaming forum in 2016 in which he talked about what weapons might be used in a mass shooting. The FBI said the posting was flagged and investigators talked with the gunman at his home in Aztec, where he lived with his parents. At the time, he reportedly did not own any weapons other than an airsoft pellet gun and said he had no plans for an attack and just liked to troll sites online. Casey J. Marquez and Francisco I. Fernandez were the two victims in the shooting. Marquez was a cheerleader and was planning to participate in the upcoming Orange Bowl. Her classmates said she came across as a student leader. Bryn Divine, a senior at Aztec High School, remembered Marquez being a vibrant and friendly student who often won dance contests at school events. “She lit up pretty much any room we were all in,"" Divine said. ""She was such a fun person to be around."" Fernandez was known for his speedy typing and interest in computers. His family said he had a bright future ahead of him. According to a KOB4, a local news station, Fernandez was a recent transfer to Aztec High School. He participated in sports and wanted to attend college. His father ""never saw this coming,"" KOB4 reported. Police said the two victims were not specific targets. Atchison left a thumb drive on his body which apparently contained a note that detailed his plan for Thursday morning. “If things go according to plan, today would be when I die,” Atchison’s note begins. In his note, he said he planned to “gear up” before holding a classroom hostage. He said he would eventually commit suicide. “Work sucks, school sucks, life sucks,” he said in his note. “I just want out of this s---.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

324,http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/08/new-mexico-high-school-shooter-planned-to-die-had-been-investigated-by-fbi-in-2016/," The man who killed two students at Aztec High School in New Mexico on Thursday morning was a former student who entered the school with no intention of walking out alive.   The shooter was 21-year-old William Atchison, a local gas station employee. According to plans found on a thumb drive in his backpack, he planned to hold a class hostage and kill students before killing himself.  “If things go according to plan today, today would be when I die,” the document said. “I wait until the school buses are detected, then head out on foot disguised as a student.  “Go somewhere and gear up, then hold a class hostage and go apes—, then blow my brains out.”    The letter revealed that Atchison was fed up with life, and ready to end his own, although it doesn’t explain why he felt the need to kill students in the process.  “Work sucks, school sucks, life sucks,” he wrote. “[Expletive] this state, it really is bad. Think I’m insane? I’m actually more rational, peaceful and less loony than a majority of the citizenry of this entire region.”   Atchison entered the school with students, and went to a second floor bathroom to prepare for the shooting.  A student, Francisco Fernandez, unknowingly walked in on him in the bathroom. That’s when Atchison killed him.  Shortly after, he saw another student, Casey Marquez, in the hallway and killed her.  The gunshots alerted officials to put the school on lockdown. Atchison fired some shots at students hiding in a supply closet, but no one else was injured.  Atchison shot himself just as police were entering the school.   Atchison didn’t have a criminal history, but he was the subject of an FBI investigation in 2016.  Someone reported Atchison for a message he wrote online asking about cheap assault rifles to use in a mass shooting. The FBI found no evidence of criminal activity, and Atchison claimed he wasn’t being serious.  The gun he used to kill the two Aztec students was a legally-purchased Glock 9mm.  Police found a note in Atchison’s home after the shooting which apparently scheduled out the day, including times for ""work,"" ""prep,"" ""pack up,"" ""walk,"" and finally, at 8 a.m., “die.”   We use cookies to better understand website visitors, for advertising, and to offer you a better experience.

(Associated Press) The city of Las Vegas has bumped up security along its famed Strip, installing 800 steel posts between the street and sidewalk in an effort to increase pedestrian safety. Clark County finished the project on Wednesday, installing the bollards at seven different locations between Tropicana Avenue and Spring Mountain Road, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The county plans on adding 7,500 more posts by next year. The posts can withstand a head-on collision from a 15,000-pound vehicle traveling 50 mph, officials said. The project comes as attacks on pedestrians have become a popular method of planned attacks across the world. On Oct. 31, a suspect later identified as Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbekistan-born resident of New Jersey, was accused of killing eight people in an ISIS-inspired attack after driving a truck through a bike path in New York City. Saipov pleaded not guilty in November and awaits further court proceedings. Tuesday marked the one-year anniversary of an attack in Berlin in which a Tunisian asylum seeker, Anis Amri, hijacked a truck and drove it through a crowd of people at a Christmas market, killing 12. Amri was killed by police four days later.

326,http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/07/concealed-carry-bill-passes-in-the-house-but-the-senate-will-likely-shut-it-down/,"The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow gun owners' concealed carry permits to be recognized across state lines.  The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, which passed 231-198, has another measure attached to it designed to beef up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. That many believe the NICS bill could prevent future shootings like the church massacre in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last month. The Air Force admitted it failed to report a domestic violence court-martial conviction for the Sutherland shooter, Devin Kelly, to the federal background database, as required by Pentagon rules. That information would have made him ineligible to buy a gun. The legislation was initially two separate bills and 14 House Republicans voted against it. Six Democrats voted in favor of the bill: Sanford Bishop (Ga.), Henry Cuellar (Texas), Vicente Gonzalez (Texas), Ron Kind (Wis.), Collin Peterson (Minn.), and Kurt Schrader (Ore.). House GOP leaders said the bills were combined so that lawmakers would have to cast only one vote, The Hill reported.  People crossing state lines with a concealed carry permit and firearm would be allowed to carry their guns concealed if they have a valid government-issued photo ID. Also, they would be required to follow established state and locals laws for handguns. According to the bill, qualified individuals who lawfully carry or possess a concealed handgun in another state are not subject to the federal prohibition on possessing a firearm in a school zone and may carry or possess a handgun in federally owned lands that are open to the public. Those opposing the legislation say it won't work since concealed carry laws such as gun safety training, age limit, and prohibitions on people with a history of violence vary from state to state.  The NICS legislation forces federal agencies such as the military — and encourages states — to do a better job reporting offenses that would prohibit people from buying firearms, according to the Post. The NICS determines gun buyers' eligibility to purchase based on criminal records and other offenses that are reported to the agency. The ""fix NICS"" legislation would penalize federal agencies that fail to report criminal records and domestic violence records to the FBI. It also incentivizes states to regularly and accurately report criminal records to the bureau by allocating federal grants to states that comply. This portion of the bill had wide bipartisan support.  Gun control advocates are saying the Republicans should have kept the bills separate and are accusing the GOP of using the bipartisan portion of the measure to get the concealed carry portion of the legislation passed. • “When we were negotiating in a very bipartisan, good-faith way, the understanding was the NICS-fix bill would be considered on its own,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), an original co-sponsor of the bill told the Post. “Combining them would be completely unwise and unacceptable, and everyone knows it.” • ""The bill is horrible,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told Politico. ""What it does is rob every state the ability to maintain standards on concealed carry."" • ""Congress has failed the American people,"" said former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords (D), who suffered severe injuries during a 2011 mass shooting. ""After two of our nation's worst mass shootings, Congress took direct instruction from the gun lobby and passed a bill that will override existing state laws and allow dangerous, untrained people to carry guns in every state and every city. Let's be clear: These politicians are trading our safety for political contributions from the gun lobby.""  • “Taken together, these two bills preserve and protect the rights guaranteed to us by the Second Amendment,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman  Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said Tuesday, according to the Post. “I believe that both bills complement each other in keeping people safe.” • “This vote marks a watershed moment for Second Amendment rights,” NRA Executive Director Chris W. Cox. “The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is the culmination of a 30-year movement recognizing the right of all law-abiding Americans to defend themselves, and their loved ones, including when they cross state lines.” • “We support both bills, and if they get combined we’ll support the combined bill — and if they’re not combined, we’ll support both bills separately,” Lawrence G. Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, told the Post. “They’re both good bills and they both should pass, and Americans should be allowed to exercise their constitutional right.”  It would take eight Senate Democrats, along with all 52 Senate Republicans to get the 60 votes needed to pass the next hurdle. “When you put them together, it makes it harder for us to do what we can do, and can do now,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who co-authored the NICS bill, said.  “I want to separate those two out, get the 'fix NICS' bill passed, and hopefully save some lives.” “I don’t think the votes are there in the Senate to pass concealed carry,"" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said, according to the Post. Murphy is a lead author of the background checks bill. According to The Hill, a bipartisan coalition in the Senate has enough votes to break a filibuster on a stand-alone NICS bill.

The 69-year-old was arrested on suspicion of a weapons charge after authorities were tipped off about his alleged desire to kill Muslims. By
      
        Claudia Koerner Last updated on December 4, 2017, at 7:32 p.m. ET Posted on December 4, 2017, at 6:55 p.m. ET A 69-year-old Florida man was arrested last week after allegedly planning to carry out a mass shooting at a Florida mosque, authorities announced Monday. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said his office received a tip in late October that Bernandino Bolatete had expressed ""strong anti-Islamic sentiment"" and planned a mass shooting at the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida. An undercover detective began speaking to Bolatete and other state and federal agencies began to take steps to prevent an attack. According to court records, the detective became friendly with Bolatete, a Philippine national who has a green card, at a local shooting range. Bolatete confessed his failing health — the result of being shot in the kidney by a police officer in the Philippines years ago. Bolatete claimed to have killed the officer who shot him, court records said, and he also described his own prowess with firearms. In one conversation, the detective and Bolatete drove past the mosque on their way to the firing range. Bolatete said he expected bad news about his remaining kidney at an upcoming doctor's appointment and would then go to the mosque to kill worshippers, according to a transcript of the conversation in court documents: ""I have to bring my ... my long guns there and uh, stay at that, uh, tower. Keep shooting those Muslims, you know, on Friday. (laughing)"" Bolatete revealed he had considered how to access the minaret at the Islamic center, the documents said. And he told the detective he had five rifles. ""So we'll try ... we will try a Christian doing uh, terroristic [sic] act this time, hum, to the Muslims the, they [laughing] they doing it all the time. You know?"" he said, according to the court records. On a Facebook page that appeared to belong to Bolatete, he described himself as a shooting sport enthusiast and posted multiple photos of himself at a gun range. At least one post contained anti-Muslim propaganda — a fake news story headlined ""EVIL: Radical Muslims Rape, Make Woman Quote Quran, But How They 'Finish Her Off' Is the Worst."" In another conversation, the detective told a story about a Muslim man who hadn't paid him for work on the man's home. Bolatete offered advice to the detective on how to kill the man and get away with it, according to the court documents. On Nov. 24, the detective mentioned a friend was selling a firearm silencer. Three days later, Bolatete asked the detective if the silencer was still for sale because he ""might need it,"" court records said. Bolatete said he did not want to fill out paperwork to register the silencer because it would give authorities the right to search him, court records said. Bolatete was charged Friday on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm silencer, a federal offense. The purchase of the silencer was captured on an audio recording, according to court records. A Jacksonville Sheriff's Office SWAT team recovered it from Bolatete as they searched the room he was renting in a local home. The FBI then informed leaders at the Islamic center about the alleged plans as well as Bolatete's arrest. At no time during the investigation was anyone at the mosque at risk, FBI Special Agent in Charge Charles Spencer said Monday. If convicted, Bolatete would face up to 10 years in prison, and he could still be charged with other offenses related to his alleged plans. A civil rights investigation is ongoing, Spencer added. ""[The FBI's mission] includes enforcing civil rights statutes and protecting the public’s right to exercise freedom of religion as guaranteed by the First Amendment,"" he said. ""A civil rights investigation is ongoing. The FBI will not stand for threats of violence in our community against any group, and we will protect the freedoms the Constitution provides."" The local chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations praised the arrest of Bolatete, saying the attack he allegedly hoped to commit was an act of terrorism. ""This should concern not only Muslims, but all Florida residents regardless of faith,"" CAIR-Florida communications director Wilfredo Ruiz said in a statement. ""CAIR-Florida continues to work closely with our community to keep them safe by providing security training sessions in mosques and other locations throughout the state.""

It has been five years since the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn.; a year and a half since the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla.; and two and a half months since Las Vegas.

330,http://uproxx.com/news/las-vegas-mass-shooting/,"Getty Image Updates are available at the bottom of this story. A gunman opened fire on attendees of a country music festival outside the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas late Sunday night. At least 58 have been confirmed dead and over 515 have been injured, according to multiple reports. The Washington Post reports that lone male gunman was responsible for the carnage — later identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock — has been “confronted” and killed. The Post also noted that local police were “searching for a woman named Marilou Danley who was said to be the gunman’s ‘traveling companion.'” The authorities have since located her. Accounts of the attack that have emerged so far paint a gruesome and terrifying picture. According to the Las Vegas Journal Review, the shooter was “firing down at concertgoers from upper-level rooms at Mandalay Bay.” The attack came during the last performances on the final night of the three-day Route 91 country music festival, which has been held for the past four years on a 15-acre lot on Las Vegas Boulevard across from Mandalay Bay … Concertgoer Ivetta Saldana said Jason Aldean stopped in the middle of his performance and was rushed off the stage. She was there with a friend and said the shots sounded like fireworks. She said she hid in a sewer. “It was a horror show,” she said standing in Town Square shopping center south of the Strip. “People were standing around, then they hit the floor.” Matt and Robyn Webb from Orange County were watching the final performance of the night at Route 91 when the shooting started and people began to run for the exits. They said they sheltered underneath their seats as burst after burst of gunfire rained down from the direction of Mandalay Bay. “It just kept coming,” Robyn Webb said. “It was relentless.” Multiple reports have noted that the Mandalay Bay hotel was put on complete lockdown, and flights in and out of the nearby McCarren airport were suspended out of fear that a plane might be hit by the gunman’s bullets. Video footage captured by country fest goer Drew Akioshi embedded below provides a window into the moment the shooting started and gives a glimpse of the horror and chaos concert-goers experienced on Sunday night. From the sound of the gunfire, it appears as though the gunman used some sort of military grade, rapid-fire automatic weapon. Warning: the video is quite disturbing. UPDATE #1: NBC News was first to report at least 50 people have now died and over 200 have been injured. The suspect, who was shot and killed by police, has been identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock from Mesquite, Nevada, who had been living with Marilou Danley]. According to CBS News, authorities located Danley, who they believe was with Paddock before the shooting occurred, shortly after they began searching for her. UPDATE #2: Moments after White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed with NBC News that Trump had been briefed on the events in Las Vegas, the president issued his first response to the shooting on Twitter. “My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting,” he wrote. “God bless you!” My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2017  UPDATE #3: In an early morning press conference, Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters Paddock was firing down on the concert attendees from the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel. This is also where police ultimately confronted and killed the suspect.

US mass shootings.

Sheriff Lombardo and other law enforcement officials previously avoided providing a number of potential weapons when asked by reporters. There were at least 8 guns and a number of long rifles in the alleged shooter’s room, per Las Vegas Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 2, 2017  UPDATE #6: According to a new statement from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, an estimated 406 people were injured during Sunday night’s mass shooting. In addition, the LVMPD also revealed officers “found the suspect dead” when they breached his hotel room in the Mandalay Bay shortly thereafter. Sheriff Lombardo told reporters in a subsequent press conference they believe the suspect killed himself prior to their entry.

It isn’t clear if only one or both of the windows, which were covered by blue tarps flapping in the wind, were used by the suspect during Sunday night’s mass shooting.

The Islamic State also purportedly released a video depicting the city as a possible target last May. Considering what the authorities have said publicly about the suspect, however, there’s little evidence to suggest the claim is valid. UPDATE #9: FBI Special Agent Aaron Rouse briefly commented on the claim made earlier by the Islamic State during a press conference. “As this the event unfolds, we have determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group,” he said. “As this investigation continues, we will continue to work with our partners to ensure this is factually, thoroughly and absolutely investigated to be able to bring comfort and peace back to this community.” BREAKING: Despite online claims, FBI says have found no connection with any int’l terror group in Las Vegas attack. https://t.co/JQMPbcbWs1 — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) October 2, 2017",2017-12-04 16:00:43,Over 50 Killed In Mass Shooting At Music Festival On Las Vegas Strip,,68816,http://www.uproxx.com/#spider
331,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/UC3H6M51h6k/,"Country superstar Sheryl Crow debuted a gun control song during the December 11 airing of Good Morning America, saying the new track will help commemorate the upcoming 5th anniversary of the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary. That December 14, 2012, attack was carried out by a 20-year-old who stole his mother’s guns, killed his mother with them, then went to the gun-free school where he shot and killed six unarmed school staff members and 20 students. Crow says the song, “The Dreaming Kind,” about Sandy Hook, came to her after the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas. According to ABC News, Crow said she wrote the song but did not know what to do with it until the gun control group Sandy Hook Promise reached out to her with a role for the song in the Sandy Hook anniversary. Crow said, “I just have written this song which is basically about what they went through.” The singer said she believes the song “represents the voice of the parents of Sandy Hook victims and others working to end gun violence.”  Crow praised Sandy Hook Promise as a “fantastic organization” and said proceeds from sales of her song  will benefit the gun control group. Crow stressed that the song’s purchasers could overpay if they wish. She said, “You can download the song for a dollar, or for however much money, so if you want to download it for $300 that’s great, you have my permission.” In April, 2015, Breitbart News released a series of stories on country singer Tim McGraw’s support of Sandy Hook Promise, which included a July 17, 2015, concert in which all proceeds went to the gun control group. This came at a time when Sandy Hook Promise was supporting a gun confiscation bill in Oregon and federal expansion of background checks after unsuccessfully opposing a concealed carry bill for law-abiding citizens in Georgia.

332,http://time.com/5052840/2017-hero-shooting-hurricane-fire/?iid=sr-link1,"The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Hurricanes that devastated America’s coastline. Wildfires that tore through homes and vineyards. Hundreds lost their lives, and thousands more were injured or had their homes destroyed, in the shootings and natural disasters that hit the U.S. in 2017. But amid the chaos, a handful of heroes (and one steadfast dog) rose out of tragedy, spreading light in dark moments with their bravery and selflessness. Here are five of their stories: After watching Hurricane Maria ravage Puerto Rico in September, killing dozens and leaving much of the island without electricity, chef José Andrés started cooking and has barely stopped. He quickly mobilized a team that has offered far more fresh, hot meals than have government organizations and agencies like the Red Cross. Through his nonprofit, World Central Kitchen, which aims to empower communities through food, Andrés has served more than 2.8 million meals via a network of kitchens across the island. Andrés hopes to show that chefs can be just as essential as medics when disaster strikes. “You bring doctors for health care in disasters,” he says. “When you have to feed people and be creative about it, you will bring in cooks.” World Central Kitchen’s operations began to wind down in October as more local grocery stores reopened, but Andrés, based in D.C., returned to Puerto Rico in November with plans to continue serving food through Christmas. “We still have a crisis in the heart of America,” he says. He anticipates a total of more than 3.2 million meals will have been served by year’s end. When bullets rang out at the Route 91 Harvest country-music festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, Jonathan Smith could have fled. Instead, the 30-year-old father of three raced back toward danger to help about 20 strangers—many of whom were too frozen in fear to move. He picked up a woman off the ground and carried her to safety. He lifted another who had fallen, and he roused many to start running. “I just did what anybody would do,” says Smith, who services copiers for a living. “No one deserves to be in that situation and be left like that.” Fifty-eight people were killed in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, and more than 500 were wounded—­including Smith, who was shot while helping two young girls who were hiding behind a mini SUV. (The bullet is still lodged in the lower left side of his neck.) But because many people, like Smith, sacrificed their own safety to help others escape the line of fire, countless lives were also saved. After the massacre, one of the people whom Smith had helped recognized him on TV and emailed to thank him. “I was the lady you saw fall in front [of] you on the sidewalk outside of the concert,” wrote Brenda Sillito. “I don’t have the right words to tell you how amazing you are for all you did that night and helping so many people, but you are.” Sillito, 60, of Canada, says many people ran past her as she was lying on the sidewalk within range of gunfire. Smith was the only one to stop. “It took me at least a week after I tracked him down to write the email because I wanted to use the right words,” she says. “I wanted him to really understand how important he was to me that night. I feel, honestly, that he saved my life.” As Hurricane Harvey pounded Houston on Aug. 27, Annie Smith went into labor at home. Her husband Greg Smith, an anesthesiologist, was preparing to deliver the baby himself after he was unable to get through to 911, when neighbors and a group of firefighters arrived to help. Fearing the mother-to-be could get swept away in the rising water, neighbor Tara Gower, an off-duty EMT, ordered everyone to form a human chain. They locked arms, enabling Annie to cling to them as she made her way to a waiting truck. “Your own safety you don’t think about until later,” Gower says. The couple’s daughter Adrielle was born early the next morning. Her parents say her birth reminded them of people’s inherent goodness. “When something bad happened, people’s true character unfolded,” says Greg, “and it was exceptional.” Ian Grillot was watching a basketball game at a Kansas bar on Feb. 22 when a gunman walked up to a pair of Indian men, reportedly told them to “get out of my country” and opened fire. ­Grillot initially ducked for cover along with the rest of the people at the crowded bar—but in an instant, he decided to try to subdue the shooter. “I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself if I didn’t do anything,” says Grillot, now 25. He jumped up and rushed the gunman from behind, but before he could reach him, a bullet pierced his hand and entered his chest, where it remains. The gunman wound up killing one of his targets, a 32-year-old engineer, and injuring the other. (He was captured several hours later.) But in the wake of the shooting, which was deemed a hate crime, ­Grillot was hailed for his attempt to fight bigotry; India House Houston, a community center in Texas, even raised money for him, which he used to buy his first home. Jiten Agarwal, a leader in the group, said Grillot “reminds us of the promise of America and its greatness.” While wildfires ravaged California’s wine country this fall, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes, Odin, a pet dog, stayed behind to protect his family’s eight rescue goats. The 1-year-old Great Pyrenees, a livestock guardian dog, paced back and forth in front of his charges as his owners rushed to evacuate their 35-acre forest property in Sonoma County on Oct. 8. “I looked at him, and he wasn’t going,” says Odin’s owner, Roland Hendel. “I said to him, ‘O.K., Odie, you got this then. Take care of the goats and we’ll be back to get you.’” Hendel felt “terrible guilt and sadness,” fearing he’d left his beloved puppy to burn in the wildfires that killed at least 44 people and hundreds of animals. When the 49-year-old electrical engineer returned to his property the next day, a surreal sight greeted him amid the burning trees, smoke and ash. “I could make out Odie’s tail wagging,” Hendel recalls. Odin’s fur and whiskers had been singed, but he and all the goats were left mostly unscathed. “He was so happy to see me, and he was very proud of himself,” Hendel says. Odin demonstrated courage and perseverance, according to his owner, but he also taught his human counterparts to value life over material things. “Odin risked his life to save those goats, and that’s a big part of the lesson,” Hendel says. “Life is so precious.” With additional reporting by Mahita Gajanan Contact us at letters@time.com.",2017-12-15 00:00:00,‘I Just Did What Anybody Would Do.’ 5 Heroes Who Gave Us Hope in 2017,,4419,http://time.com

@EmilyMiller Emily Miller is an award-winning journalist and the author of the book ""Emily Gets Her Gun"" about gun control policies. President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are strongly pro-Second Amendment, which means new gun control laws were dead on arrival in 2017. But the mainstream media, not to be quietly defeated, exposed its anti-gun bias more than ever this year. The national newspapers and left-wing TV networks continued to churn out unbalanced reports on gun crime and laws, while refusing to learn accurate terminology. Here are the top offenders. 1. USA Today The colorful newspaper that lands outside hotel rooms seized the mantel for this year’s most ridiculous, yet hilarious anti-gun propaganda reporting. One story, authored by the unnamed “editors,” lists accessories that can be added to the popular AR-15 rifle. The authors include in that list a “chain-saw bayonet.” To illustrate this, USA Today tweeted a video depicting an actual chainsaw attached—somehow—to the bottom of a rifle. A look at the gun used in the Texas church shooting. https://t.co/xdxIf5fR77 pic.twitter.com/sUY1mCCLZC — USA TODAY (@USATODAY) November 8, 2017  Anyone with common sense knows a chain saw weighs more than a rifle and its weight would pull it down, much less be stuck to an electric socket. Readers immediately mocked the absurd getup by posting mockups of other “possible modifications” to an AR-15—laugh-out-loud things like a nuclear missile and a full-size F-16. You forgot some other ""modifications,"" @USATODAY . pic.twitter.com/MDChF5IrT2 — Guy Relford (@guyrelford) November 9, 2017  Andrew Wilkow added increasingly smaller AR-15s under the full-size one, like one of those Russian wood dolls of decreasing sizes. Looks like @USATODAYfound another scary #AR15 mod #ChainsawBayonet pic.twitter.com/0P4ViMHSZV — Andrew Wilkow (@WilkowMajority) November 9, 2017  2. CNN After the horrifying shooting of Republican members of Congress on a softball field, CNN published a story in June titled “Where does the GOP baseball shooting leave the gun control debate?” It was not a news report by any definition. The entire article is an interview—conducted by email—with the president of the (mostly irrelevant) Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The reporter did not “email interview” any pro-Second Amendment group or activist for any balance. CNN didn’t even include that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who almost died in the politically motivated shooting, had not changed his views on protecting the Second Amendment from any further infringement. Also, there seems to be no one employed by CNN who has any knowledge of firearms statistics. Jim Acosta, the senior White House correspondent, tweeted: “Since Sandy Hook there have been at least 1,552 mass shootings, with at least 1,767 people killed and 6,227 wounded.” Since Sandy Hook there have been at least 1,552 mass shootings, with at least 1,767 people killed and 6,227 wounded. https://t.co/RZeFDHhYmR — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) December 14, 2017  Acosta, who has almost a half-million followers on Twitter, was not actually citing CNN, but an article in the left-wing outlet Vox. Click through the article and you’ll see the data it contains is riddled with errors. It takes statistics from a group called “Gun Violence Archive,” which makes up out of whole cloth the definition of “mass shooting” to include people who are shot, but not killed. The group includes “news reports” for media sources instead of citing law enforcement agencies. Nowhere in the article does Vox mention that there is an official government definition of “mass shooting,” which is four or more people killed outside the home in one incident. In fact, the number of people killed annually in mass shootings has been an average of 23 over the last 30 years. Don’t believe me? That statistic is from leading gun control voice in Congress Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who gets her data from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Acosta never explained his promotion of the bad reporting. The tweet remains on his account, giving the fake news legitimacy to CNN viewers. 3. NBC News In this story, published five years after the Sandy Hook massacre, NBC reports that Congress has passed no new gun control laws, even when President Barack Obama was in office. That was true (aside from regulations through the White House), but NBC gives every reason for this, except a fact-based one. The reason Congress doesn’t pass more gun control laws is that not one has ever been proven to reduce gun crime. Instead, NBC puts the blame on anti-gun groups not being unified against the powerful NRA. (That would come as big a surprise to the Second Amendment Foundation, Gun Owners of America, and other pro-Second Amendment groups.) NBC also nonsensically reports that gun control groups can’t compete with the resources of the NRA. It leaves out that those groups receive tens of millions of dollars from billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, while the NRA is funded by its grassroots members. To cap off the bias in this story, NBC violates journalism rule 101, which is to ask a representative from the other side of the issue for a response. 4. The Economist The Economist was once a reliable source of information on economics and finance. But, as this gun story makes clear, the magazine is now a partisan tool of the left. In a November story about the tragic church shooting in Texas, The Economist cites “mass shooting” data from Mother Jones, a far-left outlet, rather than government agencies. Then the reporter writes that the shooter used an AR-15, which “was prohibited in 1994, but legalized in 2004 when America’s assault-weapons ban expired.” That’s true, but not the whole story. The ban expired because Congress determined it was not effective in decreasing the number of homicides by rifle. The reader is left with the false impression that lack of a gun ban was directly responsible for the horrific church shooting. The Economist does not even include data from the FBI, which would illuminate readers about the issue of gun violence. The most recent statistics available are from 2016. The FBI data show that there were 11,004 homicides by firearm. Of those, only 374 were by rifles of any kind. 5. The Associated Press Almost every media outlet in the country—TV, print, and online—pays the Associated Press to use its wire service to supplement or replace its own reporting. This means AP has an outsized impact on news reports because its work appears in everything from local newspapers to network news. Eagle-eyed Cargar Dolor recently tweeted to me: “This AP story from today claims that authorities recovered a ‘40mm pistol.’” This AP story from today claims that authorities recovered a ""40mm pistol"". https://t.co/V8IxfPfoGU — Cargar Dolor (@k_d_payne) December 14, 2017  Clearly, the reporter knows nothing about the basic ballistics of firearms, and neither do the editors. I tweeted to AP to correct this to a .40 caliber pistol, which it eventually did. Meanwhile, the more educated public tweeted to me that “40mm” is the size of a cannon or a grenade launcher. Many of these mistakes would be funny if they weren’t rooted in ideological narrowness. They show how the mainstream media deliberately attempts to confuse the public in order to build support for more gun control laws. At a higher level, the repeated bad reporting in just one area of public debate that shows the top editors and managers in mainstream media assign reporters to cover gun crime, without any expertise on the subject, research into data, or fact-checking. If it weren’t for conservative media and informed social media users, the average American might walk the streets in fear of being attacked by someone wielding a rifle with a chainsaw attached to the bottom.

334,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/507500642/0/phoenix/nation~Leave-it-to-the-NRA-to-hijack-the-first-bipartisan-gun-bill-in-years/,"Two months. Two horrific mass shootings that rocked America. Then, two gun bills in the House of Representatives. And one terrible idea from National Rifle Association headquarters. Leave it to the gun lobby to ruin a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation in Congress. More: The day of the Sutherland Springs massacre, I went to buy a gun. I got a lesson instead. More: On gun control, there's nothing and everything left to say: Jill Lawrence There is a bill that is backed broadly in the House and has enough Senate Republican support to beat a filibuster. The “Fix NICS” Act would improve the gun-sale background check system simply by helping ensure that the staffs of federal agencies and states complete a couple more keystrokes and mouse clicks every day and submit more records into the system. It would even incentivize compliance, making it pay for states to do the job. Ultimately, more records in the system would make it less likely that a felon — or another convicted domestic abuser like November’s Texas church shooter — gets a gun and destroys lives. But some House members decided they had to carry the NRA’s water. Just days before Americans mark five years since the horrifying mass shooting at Sandy Hook School on Dec. 14, 2012, they hijacked this popular, common-sense bill and saddled it with the gun lobby’s top priority, “Concealed Carry Reciprocity.” They paired a sensible, urgently needed solution with the gun lobby’s biggest dream and passed them together, as a package, on Wednesday. It was a cynical, reckless gambit by the gun lobby and its allies. And it reduced to absurdity the so-called ""gun debate"" in this Congress. Talk about robbing Peter to pay Paul. As a package, “Fix NICS” would keep guns from domestic abusers — while “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would force states to allow people to carry concealed guns in public even if they are domestic abusers, have other dangerous histories, or lack even the most basic safety training to carry concealed guns in public. “Fix NICS” would decrease the chance that the next domestic violence call to which a cop responds involves an abuser with a firearm. “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would leave local police powerless to stop people with dangerous histories from carrying guns. In short, “Fix NICS” would strengthen our gun laws. “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would eviscerate them. The bad far outweighs the good, and it isn’t a close call. “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would gut our gun laws because it would force each state to accept the concealed carry standards of every other state — even states that have weaker standards, or worse, no standards at all. And it would not establish a national standard for who is allowed to carry a hidden, loaded gun in public. More: Chris Matthews: RFK came around to pushing gun control. We should too. POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media For example: Some states allow abusive dating partners or people with violence misdemeanor convictions to carry. During the House Judiciary Committee’s hearing on “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” last week, the committee chair found himself forced to admit that, yes, the bill would allow violent misdemeanants to carry concealed guns across the country. In addition, 12 states do not require a permit or a background check to carry. Nineteen states do not require any gun safety training in order to carry. “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would make those weakest links the law of the land. It would do nothing to improve public safety. In fact, it would make America less safe. That’s the reason the opposition to “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” is so widespread. The American Prosecutors Association opposes it. So does the U.S. Conference of Mayors. So does the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, which includes many of America’s largest law enforcement organizations. “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would force states to allow many people to concealed carry without a permit — a move the American people oppose, too. A Pew survey released in June found 81% of us oppose allowing people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. (Polling commissioned by Everytown for Gun Safety notably found opposition registering above 85% in a number of red states.) So, just weeks after two of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, and as polls show the American public increasingly demanding stronger gun laws, there were two possible paths for the House. The one it chose was to let NRA headquarters run amok and try to impose its “guns everywhere” vision on America. The other path, the right path, is still an option in the Senate. It should listen to law enforcement and the American people, reject the combined “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” package and pass a clean version of “Fix NICS” to help keep guns out of dangerous hands.

335,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/newtown-sandy-hook-shooting-victims-five-years-later,"In the years since the mass shooting that killed 20 children and six educators, families have memorialized their loved ones in many different ways Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.15 BST School safety campaigns. An animal sanctuary. A children’s book. Support for mental health reform. A lawsuit against the manufacturer of a military-style rifle. In the five years since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, the families of the 20 children and six educators killed have taken very different paths to honor the lives of their loved ones.  Some family members have chosen to remain intensely private. Others have become prominent advocates for gun violence prevention. No single campaign represents all 26 families. The continuing lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor and dealer of the AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting, for example, was brought by the families of only nine Sandy Hook victims and one survivor. Here, drawn from the joint website for the Sandy Hook victims’ families, is a brief look at how each family has asked to remember and honor those who died. “Smart, funny, curious, messy, in-intimidated, and adventurous,” her family wrote, describing six-year-old Charlotte. “We like to use the word BOLD.” A foundation in Charlotte’s honor supports a therapy dog program, a scholarship for students studying to become veterinarians, and a grant to help couples grieving the death of a child. Together with an award-winning children’s book author, her parents co-wrote a picture book, Good Dogs, Great Listeners, which tells the story of Charlotte and her dog, Lily. Charlotte’s brother also wrote a book about his experience with therapy dogs after his sister’s death, called The Dogs of Newtown. Seven-year-old Daniel was unusually compassionate, always concerned that the people around him were happy and safe. He used to sit next to a special needs girl in his class to “make sure she was OK”, and when she would lose her glasses, Daniel would find them. The “What Would Daniel Do?” campaign encourages other people to follow Daniel’s legacy of kindness. His parents have been outspoken about participating in a lawsuit against a gun manufacturer, focused on the “irresponsible” militaristic advertising for AR-15-style guns sold to civilians. Mark Barden, his father, is one of the founders of Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit that advocates for mental health reform, certain gun laws, and a violence prevention program that trains students and adults to “Know the Signs” of someone at-risk of violence. Olivia loved swimming and soccer and dancing in a pink tutu, singing and art projects and math. At dinner, she led her family in saying grace, and she was proud of her role as a big sister and her participation in an educational program at her parish church. To honor Olivia’s “zest for life”, her family has raised money for Newtown Park & Bark, a group that supports a local off-leash dog park. The organization has a page that honors Olivia’s joy, with photographs of happy dogs and messages about them. Olivia’s family also created a web site in her honor. Seven-year-old Josephine, known as “Joey”, was the “girly-est” of her sisters, and she adored her older siblings, the family wrote in a recent article in the Newtown Bee. Fun-loving and affectionate, Joey had worked hard to “meet the milestones that came so easily to her older sisters,” after being diagnosed with autism, global apraxia and apraxia of speech. Her family wrote that she had found love and support in Newtown: “Her classmates eagerly learned sign language and encouraged and included her whenever they could.” Her family has raised money for Joey’s Fund, which supports families in New England who need resources to help family members with autism. Her mother, Michele Gay, is also one of the founders of Safe and Sound Schools, an organization that promotes improved school security. A budding musician, six-year-old Ana Grace had a “gift for melody, pitch and rhythm” that stood out even in a musical family, as her father put it. “She never walked anywhere - her mode of transportation was dance. She dance from room to room and place to place.” The Ana Grace Project supports arts education and has worked with schools to implement a “Love Wins” curriculum, which supports a stronger social and emotional environment for students and staff. Recognizing that the counseling resources available to Newtown residents after the shooting are not available to every community dealing with violence, the organization has also worked to bring professional development in counseling and trauma-informed care to other communities that need them. Her father, prominent Jazz saxophonist Jimmy Greene, released a tribute album, “Beautiful Life”, in 2014. Her mother, Nelba Marquez-Greene, writes frequently on social media about grief, activism, and how political developments affect survivors of violence. A photograph of British-born Dylan in a Superman t-shirt has become one of the icons of the fight to pass tougher gun laws in America. Dylan, his family wrote, adored chocolate and cuddling and bouncing on trampolines. He was sensitive to loud noises and loved routine. He wanted to play with other kids so much, they wrote, “even though he didn’t always know how”. The Dylan’s Wings of Change Foundation benefits children with autism and other special needs. His mother, Nicole Hockley, is one of the founders and managing directors of Sandy Hook Promise. His parents have been outspoken about their participation in a lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor and dealer of the military-style weapon used in the Sandy Hook shooting. Her family described Madeleine as a “a petite princess with a big personality”, always ready to jump into surf at the beach, plunge into the pool, or ride her bike without training wheels as soon as they had been taken off. “Once you set your mind to do something,” her family wrote of her, “it was as good as done.” Catherine, with her red hair and freckles, loved animals so much she made her own business cards for “Catherine’s Animal Shelter”, her family wrote. Her title: Care Taker. “Tell your friends I am kind,” she would whisper to animals when she played with them. Catherine’s family is building an animal sanctuary in her honor on 34 acres of Connecticut farmland. The sanctuary already hosts events, and individuals and groups can donate to support the sanctuary or volunteer their time – for instance, building garden beds or clearing out invasive plants. Chase had already been an enthusiastic athlete and competitor for years. He began running competitively at age two, his family wrote. “At age 6, Chase asked to be entered into his first triathlon – in his first ever competition, he took on the field and won his age group!” The CMAK Foundation supports programs for physical and emotional well-being for kids and their families, including Race4Chase, a kids’ triathlon program. The quintessential image of Jesse, his family wrote, is him in boots with no socks, ripped jeans, an army helmet on his head, and dirt smudged on his cheek as he marched through a field from one adventure to another. When he and his classmates were targeted on December 14, his family wrote, “Jesse used his last few minutes on earth yelling to his friends to run, saving many lives.” The Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement supports a social and emotional learning program for teachers and students. Jesse’s mother Scarlett Lewis has spoken publicly about the importance of this kind of learning in children’s lives – as well as the importance of forgiveness. James was “all boy”, his family wrote, always wrestling with his father, jumping off tall objects, and moving through the world with boundless energy. He loved his sister and learning from her. He had also developed a “keen interest” in math. His family asked that donations to support the programs that brought him joy should be sent to: The James R Mattioli Memorial Fund C/O Newtown Savings Bank; 39 Main Street Newtown, CT 06470. Grace had been taking art classes since she was three years old, and showed early talent. “She saw beauty in everything and was fortunate to have found her passion early in life,” her family wrote. Through the Grace McDonnell Memorial Fund, her family wrote, they hoped to support young artists and youth art programs. Emilie loved visiting the craft store, and her family constantly found “beads, bits of paper, colored cotton balls – or anything else Emilie thought she could use to create art – all over the house.” Her family shared a photograph of her next to a canvas with a palette of paints, wearing an enormous t-shirt as an artist’s smock. The Emilie Parker Art Connection supports art programs. Alissa Parker, her mother, has written a book, An Unseen Angel, about a “faith-filled, spiritual path” to coping, healing and forgiving in the wake of tragedy. She is also one of the founders of Safe and Sound Schools. Jack had a huge smile and a love for mischief. He loved playing sports and, “most of all,” being with his big brother. To honor his memory, his family has supported Kids in the Game, an organization that provides funds for athletic programs for kids and schools that could not otherwise afford them. Noah loved playing deep imaginative games with his Legos and superhero toys. He went to school in a Batman shirt and Spider-Man shoes, listening to Gangnam Style, one of Noah’s favorite songs, on the way. His twin sister, Arielle, survived the shooting. In the wake of the shooting, Noah’s father, Lenny Pozner, founded the Honr Network, a group that works to combat the conspiracy theorists who claim the Sandy Hook shooting is a hoax and that grieving family members are “crisis actors”. The Honr Network coordinates volunteers to monitor and take down hoaxer posts and videos. Working with tech companies like Google on this effort has been an uphill battle, one that has made Pozner himself the target of intense harassment. A Florida woman was sentenced to five months in prison earlier this year for making threats against him. Caroline was “joyful”, a lover of art and dance. Before Christmas one year, she brought her piggy bank to her parents and asked to donate all of her savings to their church to make sure the every kid would have a present under their Christmas trees. At her funeral, some mourners wore pink, her favorite color, to honor her, the New Haven Register reported. The Caroline Previdi Foundation provides support for kids without financial resources to engage in extracurricular activities. As well as horseback riding, Jessica spent hours watching the Free Willy movies and taking notes on orcas, her family wrote. “Mom, I just want to be friends with an Orca,” she once said. Her family wrote, she “was always planning, asking questions, and figuring out the details”. They called her “our little CEO”. The Jessica Rekos Foundation supports horseback riding scholarships and research and internships on orca and whale conservation. Avielle had a “spitfire personality”, her family wrote. She was often barefoot. Asked what she wanted to be, she replied that she would like to be an artist ... and a spy ... and a fairy princess ... and a writer. She loved to name things: the maple trees next to her house were “Efford and Maeve”. The Avielle Foundation supports “neuroscience research aimed at understanding the brain’s chemistry, structure, and circuits that lead to violence and compassion”, as well as community education and outreach about neuroscience research and its findings, and how to promote brain health. Ben was full of urgent questions that he wanted answered at once. He demanded attention. He loved lighthouses and “dreamed of being an architect, a paleontologist and a lighthouse keeper all at once”. Ben’s Lighthouse, a community organization in Newtown, was founded to support Newtown youth over the long term as they dealt with the aftermath of the violence at Sandy Hook. Allison lined the walls of her home with rows of pictures she had drawn, and she loved drawing for people she cared about, from friends and relatives to her school bus driver. Her family wrote that they had found a final picture Allie had drawn for her first grade teacher, Victoria Soto, who was also killed in the shooting. It had a message: “I love you, Love Allie.” The Allison Wyatt Memorial Fund has donated to St Jude Children’s Research Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House Charities and International Child Art Foundation. A behavioral specialist, Rachel had “a clear focus on helping adults and children with autism”, her family wrote, and she had just completed the requirements to become a board certified behavioral analyst. Her soon-to be-fiance Tony Cerritelli had just asked her family for permission to marry her, and they were planning to become engaged on Christmas Eve. Rachel was working on a family collection of Italian recipes for a family cookbook, and she loved karate, photography, cooking and baking. At a celebration honoring her life, she was compared to The Giving Tree, a Shel Silverstein book about selflessness. Her friends and family made plans to walk and raise money for Autism Speaks to honor her life. Sandy Hook’s school principal was “strong, confident, inspiring and compassionate”, her family wrote. She balanced raising her two daughters with her own continuing education, always keeping in touch with her children as she moved from one meeting to another. “Dawn died as she lived: always in control, handling whatever came her way,” her family wrote. Erica Lafferty, one of her daughters, spoke about her mother at the Democratic National Convention in 2016 in support of Hillary Clinton and her commitment to gun violence prevention. She is now a program manager at Everytown for Gun Safety, major a gun violence prevention advocacy group. When the shooting happened, Anne Marie Murphy, a classroom aide, wrapped a child in her arms, protecting him. Both she and the child were killed. “Thank you for respecting our privacy,” her family wrote. Sensitive and focused, Lauren had worked multiple jobs, including as a substitute, on her way to getting a job as a teacher. Her family set up two scholarships in her name to support future educators: The Lauren Rousseau Memorial Scholarship, Danbury High School Scholarship Fund, 43 Clapboard Ridge Rd, Danbury, CT 06811; and the Lauren Rousseau Memorial Scholarship/University of Bridgeport Graduate School of Education, 126 Park Ave, Bridgeport, CT 06604. Members of her family traveled to Washington last week to press for tougher gun laws. Mary’s Fund honors her work as the Sandy Hook school psychologist. It provides access to mental healthcare for Connecticut residents who might not otherwise be able to get it. Her husband, Bill Sherlach, is also part of Sandy Hook Promise, and has spoken out about the importance of the lawsuit he joined against an AR-15 manufacturer. Victoria, a teacher, was “living her dream teaching first grade”, her family wrote. She lived at home with her siblings and her dog, Roxie. The Victoria Soto Memorial supports scholarships for future teachers and other educational endeavors.",2017-12-14 02:00:25,Five years after Sandy Hook: families keep the memory of lost children alive,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Unfortunately, a fireworks show at Terrigal Beach in New South Wales, Australia, didn't proceed as planned. An apparent malfunction a few minutes after the show began sent thousands of spectators running for safety, the BBC reported. A barge from which the fireworks were launched apparently caught fire after an explosion, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. ""It was an absolute chaos,"" Twitter user Anooshe Mushtaq wrote. ""The boat shooting the fireworks goes on fire and started shootings randomly. Lucky I escaped as soon as I saw the boat on fire."" Two pyrotechnicians had to be treated for minor injuries, but no other people were hurt, the report said. Australia and New Zealand were among the first nations to welcome the new year, with a grand show of fireworks exploding over the iconic Sydney Opera House and people watching from boats in the nearby harbor. In Asia, hundreds of engaged couples partook in a mass wedding ceremony in Indonesia on New Year’s Eve aimed at helping the poor who are unable to afford a wedding. South Korean Buddhists lit candles during the celebrations at Jogyesa temple. The mood for reveling were less joyous in the north, where hours after the fireworks in Pyongyang, North Korea, the country’s leader announced the capabilities of a nuclear strike, adding that his threats were now a “reality.” People in North Korea watch New Year's Day fireworks in Pyongyang.
      (Associated Press) Turkey, in addition to festivities across the nation, used the celebration to pay tribute to the victims of last year’s New Year's Day mass shooting, when 39 were killed outside a nightclub. In continental Europe, hundreds of thousands of revelers watched fireworks displays above the Quadriga at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and over the Arc de Triomphe as part of the New Year celebrations on the Champs Elysees, in Paris. Britain’s Bing Ben boomed at midnight – for only the second time since August because of renovation work – while at least 100,000 Londoners swamped the city’s center to celebrate and watch a 12-minute fireworks show. Fireworks surround London's Big Ben, which is undergoing renovation work.
      (Associated Press) The 10,000-fireworks show was accompanied by a women-only soundtrack as a tribute to the 100th anniversary of women being granted the vote in the country. Despite increased security, including armed police and security barriers, there were fewer police officers present during the celebration. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

          / CBS News Jeff Glor, an Emmy-award winning journalist, is the co-host of ""CBS This Morning: Saturday"" and a CBS News special correspondent. Since joining ""CBS This Morning: Saturday"" in June 2019, Glor has traveled extensively to cover stories across the Western Hemisphere. From the impact of toxic waves of sargassum across the Caribbean, to earthquake recovery in Haiti, to deforestation in Oregon, every week he has expanded on ""CBS This Morning: Saturday""'s unique profile, delivering in-depth reports on the biggest issues of our day. Since starting on the show, Glor has also interviewed more than a dozen authors for long profiles, further cementing ""CBS This Morning: Saturday"" as the primary destination for best new books. Since joining the network in 2007, Glor has traveled to every state and been around the world multiple times to cover the news. He's been on the ground in the middle of many hurricanes, including Michael, Florence, Irma and Superstorm Sandy. Glor reported from the scenes of mass shootings in Pittsburgh, Pa.; Thousand Oaks, Calif.; Parkland, Fla.; Sutherland Springs, Texas; Santa Fe, Texas; and Newtown, Conn., among others. He has covered wildfires across the West. As anchor of the ""CBS Evening News"" from December 2017 to June 2019, Glor helped lead the Network's coverage of the 2018 midterm elections, the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and two summits between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea, in Singapore and Vietnam. Glor was the only network evening news anchor to report from the Middle East for the opening of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. He went to the West Bank and was in the middle of an extended clash between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters. In December 2017, Glor interviewed French President Emmanuel Macron at the One Planet Summit in Paris, following President Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the 2015 Paris accord. That night, he broadcast the ""Evening News"" live from the Élysée Palace, a first for any American network. In July 2018, he conducted a two-part interview with President Trump before and after the Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Glor spoke with Mr. Trump in Scotland and again at the White House for two conversations that aired across all CBS News broadcasts and platforms. As anchor of the ""CBS Evening News,"" Glor brought back the iconic CBS News franchise ""Eye on America,"" featuring immersive reports on topics of national importance, including immigration, mass shootings, suicides and church sex abuse scandals. His investigative work is wide-ranging, including a multipart report on problems at the National Flood Insurance Program that won the 2018 SPJ award for network investigations. As a correspondent for ""CBS This Morning"" and ""60 Minutes Sports,"" Glor filed reports from Alaska, Africa, Greenland, Ireland and Newfoundland. For the ""CBS Evening News,"" from 2013 to 2015, Glor's ongoing series of reports on the recall crisis at General Motors and Takata sent him across the U.S. to find survivors, stories and information that were kept hidden from the public for years. He was one of the first journalists on the ground in Haiti following that country's devastating earthquake in 2010. Glor reported from Iraq in 2007 and 2008, where he spent time embedded with U.S. troops. He also covered the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games in China and the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. In 2008 Glor was a lead member of the CBS News team that covered Pope Benedict XVI's historic visits to Washington, D.C. and New York City. He was also the primary campaign correspondent for the Network's morning show during the 2008 presidential election. In addition to his reporting assignments, Glor was a lead anchor on CBSN, CBS News' 24/7 streaming news service, during its critical launch period. Glor served as anchor of the weekend editions of the ""CBS Evening News"" on Saturday from 2009-2010 and Sunday from 2012-2016. He anchored ""The Early Show"" in 2011. Before joining CBS News, Glor was the weekend evening news anchor and a weekday reporter for WHDH-TV Boston (2003-2007). While there, he covered many national stories, including the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005 from Rome, and the hearings on steroid use in Major League Baseball from Washington, D.C. Prior to that, Glor was the co-anchor of WSTM-TV Syracuse's 5:00 p.m. newscast and a reporter for the 11:00 p.m. newscast (2000-2003), as well as the morning news anchor (1997-2000). Among the national stories he covered while at WSTM were the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, the first anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, and the crash of Flight 587 in Queens, New York.

343,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/512871234/0/phoenix/nation~California-community-works-to-find-peace-after-mass-killing/,"RANCHO TEHAMA RESERVE, Calif. — At the entrance to this rural community, silk flowers are propped against the welcome sign. Painted rocks bear messages such as ""love never fails"" and ""it can only get better.” Other tokens of love, hope and healing can be found throughout this remote subdivision in the pine trees where paved roads can quickly turn to gravel 110 miles northwest of Sacramento. Weeks earlier, a gunman killed five people and injured 12 others before turning the gun on himself. The 1,500 residents just now are easing into a sense of peace after Nov. 14. It's a long and slow journey, but they are finding each other. Jay Lobdell, 42, works at the G&K Country Store known informally as the community gas station. Lobdell moved to Rancho Tehama two years ago to escape harsh Michigan winters. ► Nov. 20: How other countries can help us understand U.S. mass shooting crisis► Nov. 19: ‘Run! Run! Let’s go!’ man told wife before being hit At Rancho Tehama he built an extended family of friends. His wife landed a job at Rancho Tehama School. His sister moved to the neighborhood, and he’s on a first-name basis with most of his customers. “It’s a great community,” he said. “It was nice and quiet, up until a month ago.” That was the day Lobdell saw the shooter, Kevin Janson Neal, speeding toward Rancho Tehama Elementary. “I knew all the victims, the shooter, everybody,” he said. Lobdell’s wife was working at the school that day. A quick lockdown kept Janson from killing any of the children although he continued to shoot at the school. Lobdell pointed to his wife’s car to show a bullet hole in the roof. His friend and fellow volunteer firefighter, Johnny Phommathep Sr., nearly lost his whole family that day. Phommathep’s wife, Tiffany was driving two of their three children to school when Neal pulled up next to her pickup and opened fire. Tiffany Phommathep took four bullets to her left shoulder and one to her abdomen that perforated her intestine. Their son Jake was shot above the left ankle, and Nico sustained cuts as the truck's glass shattered. Despite her injuries, Tiffany Phommathep grabbed her gun from her glove compartment, prepared to fight back. But Neal had already driven away toward the school. ► Nov. 16: Custodian diverted shooter, saved lives► Nov. 15: Why do mass shooters target children, strangers? Tehama County's assistant sheriff, Phil Johnston, later found the family and rushed them to medical treatment. “I’ve never had to thank anyone, anyone, for saving my whole family,” Johnny Phommathep said after meeting with Johnston. Johnny Phommathep said the family is healing, and his wife requires a lot of medical care. Insurance isn’t able to cover all of Tiffany Phommathep’s needs, but the money they’ve received from an online fundraiser is helping them push through. The 24 other volunteers firefighters Johnny Phommathep works with have been helping the family. “My firefighter family has offered to mow my lawn and do my dishes,” he said with a laugh. But at this point, he said it’s all about recovery. “We’re doing good as a family, he said. ""My wife is tough. My kids are tough.” Johnny Phommathep often thinks about his friend Danny Lee Elliot, 38, who died that day. “He was a good guy,” Johnny Phommathep said about his friend. “He kept a lot of good people out of our block.” Elliot and his mother, Diana Lee Steele, 68, lived across the street from Neal, who often threatened to kill them and Elliot’s son, who attended Rancho Elementary School. In January 2017, Neal stabbed Steele and Elliot’s girlfriend. But Neal's mother bailed him out shortly thereafter, and that’s when things got worse. “After January, it was a matter of when,” Johnny Phommathep said. ► Nov. 15: California shooting victims' families turn to GoFundMe for help► Nov. 15: California shooter built his own illegal guns, officials say Elliot and Steele were among the first people whom Neal killed. Neal killed his wife, Barbara Ann Glisan, 38, the day before, and law enforcement officers discovered her body buried under the floorboards of Neal's home. “That was tough to hear what he did to his wife,” Johnny Phommathep said. “She was a good lady.” The shooting shattered a sense of peace in the community, said Pastor Stephen May of Rancho Tehama Community Church. “We’ve been continuing to pray for revival,"" he said. ""People need to realize there is a spiritual need for peace."" The Sunday after the shooting, many congregants expressed anger and questioned why it happened. But the anger quickly turned to gratitude that no children died that day. May attributes the shooting to evil. “(Neal) was chosen as a vessel for evil that day, I believe anyway,” May said. “It’s a sad thing it happened. But that’s the unpredictability of life &mldr of evil, and sometimes it likes to raise its ugly head.” About three weeks after the shooting, May led a prayer at a memorial ceremony at the Rancho Tehama Association homeowners organization and read the names of each of the lives lost that day: Danny Lee Elliott, Barbara Ann Glisan, Michelle Iris McFadyen, Joseph Edward McHugh III, Diana Lee Steele. The last name he read was Neal’s. ► Nov. 15: Mass shooting suspect killed wife, hid body day before rampage► Nov. 14: Gunman kills at least 4, wounds 10, in Northern California Why pray for the shooter? “God is the final judge, no matter what we may think, what we believe,” May said. And even now residents believe that Rancho Tehama is the safest place they will ever be. For Carole Sievers, who moved from the San Francisco Bay Area about four years ago, the community seemed a perfect fit. “I have more friends here and am busier than I’ve ever been,” she said as she packed bags of food for Christmas at Rancho Tehama Community Church. But after Nov. 14, Sievers and Beverly Gano couldn't help but reflect that they could have been the ones to lose their lives that day, too. They pass by the school during their walk to church every morning. But that day, they decided to stay in. ""We all believe it was a God thing,"" Sievers said. Now the community's effort is toward repairing lives in little ways, said Lisa Kassik, who works as a case manager with the church. “We’re trying to get back to normal,” she said. That means showing up for school, showing up for church. “We’re back to doing the things we do,” Kassik said. “We’re a community of love, and we all take care of each other.” Follow Amber Sandhu on Twitter: @AmberSandhu_RS ",2017-12-25 16:25:06,California community works to find peace after mass killing,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

How the pro-Trump media, conspiratorial hyperpartisans, and delinquent platforms ushered in two parallel universes of information. By
      
        Charlie Warzel Posted on December 28, 2017, at 1:42 p.m. ET On a blistering 107-degree Phoenix evening this August, thousands came to watch Donald Trump cobble together an alternate reality. For 16 minutes, the president leaned against the podium and outlined a grim threat facing those in the room — a poisonous influence that was “fomenting divisions” in the country. He was, of course, referring to the media, decrying the press as ""liars"" and ""sick people,"" framing them as a fundamental threat to the United States. ""I really think they don't like our country. I really believe that,"" he told the crowd. He defended his comments about the recent Charlottesville protests by quoting himself at length, but omitted the key “both sides” phrase that drew ire from the media and his critics. He claimed as fact that the press would never dare show the size of his rally crowd, even though CNN’s cameras had repeatedly zoomed out to show the scope of the audience. Trump didn’t seem to mind and neither did those in attendance. There was no way his supporters in the room could know what CNN was doing with its cameras. Nor were they likely to go back and listen to or read transcripts of the speech to scour for inconsistencies when the primary source stood before them telling them what transpired. Outside the rally, Trump’s remarks set off a familiar, self-perpetuating cycle — an awkward media dance of fact-checking and contextualizing that, no matter how objective, paints the media as Trump sees it: an oppositional force. Seconds after Trump wrapped, CNN’s Don Lemon denounced the speech, calling it “a total eclipse of the facts” and “an an attempt to rewrite history."" Across the internet, Trump supporters reacted to Lemon’s comments with vindication. “As an experiment watched CNN's Don Lemon's opening diatribe of unending hostility to Trump.No wonder Trump attacked media intensely,” former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich tweeted shortly after the speech. The narrative had been set. Trump claims he's a victim, blames the media; the media becomes combative; his victimhood deepens, becomes part of the identity of his followers. Trump creates his version of reality and we end up in it one way or another. Phoenix was no isolated incident. Some version of this cycle played out almost daily in 2017. During Trump’s first year in office, it’s become clear that the internet and political culture at large aren’t just fractured or divided. They are operating in wholly separate universes, each armed with its own sets of facts, fomented by a White House–led war on the media and amplified by easily weaponized social platforms. 2017 was the year we lost our shared reality: a year where a pro-Trump media pushed conspiracy-theorizing and hyperpartisanship further toward the center of popular culture, revealing not just parallel media institutions, but parallel universes of information. You could see this in many of 2017’s most consequential stories. Former FBI director James Comey’s congressional testimony about his firing this summer was a “nothingburger” according to the pro-Trump media, while some cable chyrons — “COMEY: TRUMP ADMIN LIED ABOUT ME & FBI” — suggested a profoundly different interpretation. Mainstream media treated reports of Donald Trump Jr.’s 2016 campaign meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer as potential evidence in a building Russia collusion case; on #MAGA Twitter, reports became a “liberal Fake News ... coordinated attack on Don Jr.” and, in some circles, proof of a Democratic party plot to set up Trump’s son. two worlds Even at the end of 2017, there’s little consensus on each day’s biggest stories. This fall, a visit to Breitbart or Fox News would have likely revealed all-caps headlines claiming bombshell reports of Hillary Clinton’s (as yet unsubstantiated) participation in a quid pro quo agreement to accept payment for approval of a Russian uranium deal — a story largely dismissed or uncovered by mainstream media outlets. Depending on the makeup of your feed, it is entirely possible to view special counsel Robert Mueller and his team as intrepid, ruthless truth-seekers or as reckless, unhinged hired guns carrying out a partisan coup against the president. Partisan news bias is far from new, but in 2017, it took on a more sinister tone. On June 14, it took under an hour for the pro-Trump media to blame anti-Trump leftists and the mainstream media for an attack on congressional Republicans at a baseball field in Virginia. Before any confirmation of the shooter’s identity, numerous pro-Trump media personalities leveled blame on the mainstream media, and far-right commentators and Twitter personalities dredged up old examples of what they deemed to be incitements of violence on the left. Roughly 90 minutes after the attack, Infowars' Paul Joseph Watson published an article alleging the shooting was a ""media-inspired terror attack."" And when reports confirmed that the shooter had far-left political views that likely influenced his attack, the pro-Trump media seized on it as proof of a larger narrative of political violence by the left, one rooted in a handful of cherry-picked examples. Did the Washington Post publish its fake news Russia hit piece to drown out the bombshell #SethRich story? According to the pro-Trump media, to be a Trump supporter in 2017 was to be unfairly labeled as a racist, bigot, sexist, and Nazi, and to be under constant assault by a liberal media apparatus hell-bent on delegitimizing the president by any means necessary. A controversial New York performance of Julius Caesar this summer — in which the title character is played by a Trump doppelgänger and assassinated via a violent stabbing — was portrayed by Trump supporters as a dog whistle for an attempt on the president’s life. A tasteless and quickly denounced photoshoot by comedian Kathy Griffin holding Trump’s severed head was held forth across the pro-Trump media as a shining example of ""the intolerant left."" Griffin’s ties to CNN — which quickly dismissed the comedian from an annual hosting gig — led the pro-Trump media to start the hashtag #CNNIsISIS. The conspiracy site Infowars started a contest offering $1,000 to “anyone who is seen on TV with a ‘CNN is ISIS’ t-shirt or sign.” The mainstream media responded to the pro-Trump rhetoric this year by defensively doubling down on its commitment to reporting the truth. Early in 2017, the Washington Post unveiled a new tagline — “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” while the Times ran an ad campaign to remind readers that “the truth is hard.” In the fall, CNN ran a “facts first” marketing campaign complete with a mission statement that argued, “While opinions matter, they don't change the facts. That's why, at CNN, we start with the facts first."" Across cable news and social media, journalists constantly fact-checked, decried, and debunked conspiracy theories, fake news, and “alternative facts.” Not that the other side seemed to hear or even mind. To the pro-Trump media, it was irrelevant that its loudest voices assumed and reported the Virginia shooting was a politically motivated attack by a leftist before law enforcement released the name of the shooter. Or that the Julius Caesar performance was intended by its directors as a commentary on 2017’s divisive political culture. Or that Griffin's photo shoot was immediately decried as tasteless by people at all coordinates of the political spectrum. It did not matter that the pro-Trump media has declared the mainstream media ""fake news"" while championing stories that have either been proven false (the #Pizzagate child sex ring) or been unsubstantiated by credible evidence (the reports linking murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich's laptop to WikiLeaks). And it didn’t matter that the pro-Trump media refused to denounce political violence when a Republican billionaire running for Congress in Montana body-slammed a reporter in May. And so it continued. The year was defined by two universes of information in which — as journalist Joshua Green wrote this year — “the same set of facts is rearranged to compose an entirely different narrative.” In the end, we had a collective online nervous breakdown that bred conspiratorial thinking among the president’s biggest supporters but also his most ardent critics. In 2017, timelines were clogged by breathless viral tweetstorms from Blue Detectives: vigilante investigators hellbent on exposing multi-dimensional corruption in Trumpland. By stringing together observations, charts, and images, these “investigators” spent the year claiming to have mapped vast universe of corruption, the particulars of which they promised would be revealed shortly. The mainstream media, too, while largely rising to the journalistic occasion, has played into the hands of the pro-Trump media’s ""fake news"" trolling efforts. On multiple occasions, outlets like 60 Minutes, the New York Times, and NBC News allowed themselves to be bested by the pro-Trump media. And, especially of late, the mainstream press has made numerous reckless reporting errors — most chronicled by the Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald — in a sometimes frenzied effort to find a smoking gun in the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. My sources say the death penalty, for espionage, being considered for @StevenKBannon. I am pro-life and take no pleasure in reporting this. That the most contentious battles were waged on the internet is no coincidence. Tech’s biggest platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, powered the push of conspiracy theories from the outskirts of political discourse to its heart. Divisive, factually dubious hyperpartisan news sites — allowed to grow mostly unchecked by Facebook — made shady publishers small fortunes while pushing conspiracy theories and fake news. As a deep analysis of hundreds of hyperpartisan sites and pages showed earlier this year, a mix of money and outrage fuels online discourse in the US. The platforms’ founders and stewards spent the year first downplaying and then slowly coming to grips with — thanks, in part, to congressional scrutiny — the influence of their companies in everything from fake news to geopolitical electoral interference. Yet the platforms themselves were virtually powerless to stop bad actors from poisoning political and cultural discourse with a steady stream of propaganda, misinformation, and openly divisive content. CNN host Fareed Zakaria endorses play which features the mock assassination of President Trump. #CNNisISIS

https://t.co/CWcmCRMajK While the platforms have started to accept responsibility, there’s been little real progress throughout the year. Twitter was too committed to its free speech maximalist ideology to definitively address how to treat a president who uses it to troll North Korea about its nuclear weapons tests or to curb routine abuse on the platform. Facebook and YouTube’s inadequacy surrounding breaking news became more and more obvious with each mass shooting. Meanwhile, the platforms’ algorithms continue to dredge up and promote content to push users down radicalizing rabbit holes. Despite being dragged in front of congressional committees to account for their role in foreign misinformation campaigns, the companies appear to have no real answers for the problems their unprecedented scale creates. “I wish I could tell you we're going to be able to stop all interference, but that wouldn't be realistic,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a September message to users concerning the platform’s pledge to stop foreign governments from hijacking the platform to influence voters. It’s not just state-sponsored actors exploiting platforms to create alternate realities. In 2017, political grifters, trolls, and hackers took advantage of algorithmic flaws and moderator complacency to wage elaborate social influence campaigns. Across chat platforms like Discord, teenagers and pro-Trump supporters plotted and executed elaborate trolling campaigns against media outlets and anti-Trumpers, creating caustic hashtags and bespoke shock memes. And politically minded engineers like Microchip, a pro-Trump figure who's notorious on Twitter, orchestrated automated networks of Twitter accounts to help push trending topics and advance narratives. A new media narrative emerged: Our online reality was being gamed and manipulated by nefarious bots — part of what the New York Times called a “terrifying scourge on democracy.” Still, the Great Bot Crisis paled in comparison to the human media machine — operated by a new class of vocal, influential, and controversial Twitter pundits — bent on pushing a pro-Trump narrative and trolling its opponents at all costs. None of this seems to be going away anytime soon. Just take Alabama. If you were asked to draw up a post-truth nightmare scenario at the start of the year, it would probably look a lot like the Alabama special election: A contentious, polarizing political contest is turned on its head by seemingly clear-cut sexual abuse allegations, backed up by a wealth of credible media reports. But rather than form consensus, these reports served only to divide. Far-right media and the Republican candidate Roy Moore’s campaign itself repeatedly tried to discredit those reports, the accusers, and the entire political opposition party, effectively transforming a local election into a full-blown national culture war. It became a referendum on Republicans, Democrats, the media and its bias, conspiracy theories, sexual harassment and treatment of women, religion, and, of course, our current president. And like every battle in 2017, it was fought by two sides armed with their own sets of facts. The race felt like a near-perfect encapsulation of how we got to now. And as practitioners of the online information wars grow more sophisticated, it will likely only get worse. Indeed, 2016's tenuous grasp on shared facts feels almost quaint by 2017 standards. Just as 2017 saw the professionalization of all the dirty tricks and tactics learned in 2016 election, there’s reason to believe this year was yet another prelude — proof of concept for ideas and behaviors that will be perfected in the year to come. Any attempt at finding common ground or a shared reality will be an uphill fight against an online ecosystem that’s turned politics into a ledger with a running tally, where every outrage, misstep, and hypocritical line builds on the outrages that came before. It’s all available as manipulatable evidence to fit a narrative for each side, building in intensity, crescendoing to some unforeseeable but somehow still inevitable conclusion: Impeachment! The death of the mainstream media! Somehow, both sides are winning even if nobody feels like they are.

346,https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/us/politics/justice-department-bump-stocks-mass-shootings.html?referer=https://t.co/E47elKVH1O?amp=1#click=https://t.co/E47elKVH1O,"Advertisement Supported by By Ali Watkins WASHINGTON — Justice Department officials have indicated they do not believe the department can regulate the sale of gun bump stocks without congressional action, underscoring concern that an ongoing administrative review into that question is little more than an effort to slow-roll a politically divisive issue. The Justice Department announced this month that it would review whether bump stocks — a firearm accessory that can turn a semiautomatic rifle into a full-fledged machine gun — are prohibited under a federal statute that outlaws fully-automatic weapons. The review was prompted by the October mass shooting in Las Vegas, where gunman Stephen Paddock outfitted semiautomatic weapons with bump stocks to kill 58 concertgoers on the strip. But private and public comments from Justice Department officials following the October shooting suggest there is little appetite within the agency to regulate bump stocks, regardless of pressure from the Trump administration. Critics worry that whatever energy there is will fade over the holiday season. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and co-author of a bill to ban the devices, noted that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has said “that current law does not allow the agency to ban or regulate bump-fire stocks.” The A.T.F. is the lead enforcement agency on the issue within the Justice Department. “The A.T.F. director recently said the same thing to local police chiefs,” Ms. Feinstein said. “There’s no need for another review. It’s hard to believe this is anything other than another way for Republicans to stall congressional action.” Wyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesman, said “the attorney general has stated clearly that we will go through the regulatory process that is required by law to determine whether or not certain bump stock devices are covered by the prohibition on the possession of firearm parts used exclusively in converting a weapon into a machine gun.” “We are committed to a deliberate and thorough review,” he added. The A.T.F. referred all questions regarding the bump stock review to the Justice Department. Those hoping to limit bump stocks are losing what little momentum they had in Congress. A once-narrow, bipartisan effort to limit the sale of the device has diffused into other gun control measures after another mass shooting, on Nov. 5, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, highlighted the gaps in the government’s background check system. Thomas Brandon, the acting director of the A.T.F., told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month that it was a “possibility” that bump stocks could be considered as a restricted device under standing regulations that ban machine guns, and that the A.T.F. could regulate them without action from Congress. “If that wasn’t a possibility at the end, we wouldn’t initiate this process,” Mr. Brandon said of the review. But since the Las Vegas shooting, Mr. Brandon and other A.T.F. officials have indicated repeatedly — both publicly and in private — that they do not believe that possibility exists. Instead, they say, legislation from Congress will be required. In the week following the shooting, Justice Department officials — including the head of the department’s Firearms and Ammunition Technology division — met behind closed doors with Senate Judiciary Committee staff to discuss bump stock devices. According to some who either attended the meeting or were briefed on it, the Justice Department officials said they would not be able to take devices off shelves without new legislation from Congress. Later in October, speaking to police chiefs at a law enforcement conference in Philadelphia, Mr. Brandon of the A.T.F. said his agency did not currently have the regulatory power to control sales of bump stocks. According to a letter sent to Congress by Art Acevedo, the Houston police chief, Mr. Brandon told the conference that new legislation would be required to allow them to regulate the device. “I was seated next to the A.T.F. director at a recent meeting of Major Cities Chiefs when he advised the chiefs that new legislation will be required,” Mr. Acevedo wrote. Despite the misgivings of its own officials, the Justice Department is still opting to work the bump stocks issue through the A.T.F. That route avoids the messier politics of seeking legislation in Congress, which could pit the administration against the powerful gun lobby. The National Rifle Association has said it believes the bump stock question should be handled through the A.T.F., prompting once-amenable Republican lawmakers to back off legislative fixes. The A.T.F. announced on Dec. 5 that it had sent a notice to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget about the policy review. Once posted in the federal registry, it will be open for comment from the public and gun industry for 30 days. It is expected to be posted next week.

          / CBS News This week the House is expected to pass a bill, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, that would allow gun owners with a state-issued concealed carry permit to carry a handgun in any state that allows concealed weapons. While the majority of Americans are calling for stricter gun laws in light of several mass shootings, including America's most deadly mass-shooting to date in Las Vegas this past October, the powerful gun lobbying group has called the bill its ""highest legislative priority in Congress."" If passed, the legislation would be a major win for the National Rifle Association (NRA), which faced a tough series of election losses this past year. Several special election candidates backed by the NRA since President Trump's victory -- such as Republican candidate in the Virginia governor's race Ed Gillespie and Republican Alabama Senate primary candidate Luther Strange -- have failed. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee backed concealed carry bill. While the legislation is likely to pass the House, it faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where it will need 60 votes to pass.

350,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/07/orlando-shooting-pulse-nightclub-police-officer-omar-delgado,"Last modified on Thu 7 Dec 2017 19.09 GMT A Florida police officer who suffered post-traumatic stress after witnessing the horror of the Pulse nightclub shooting has been abruptly fired, just months before he would have secured a pension bonus for 10 years’ service.  Omar Delgado was one of the first officers to respond to the June 2016 massacre and helped wounded survivors to safety from inside the Orlando nightclub as the gunman, Omar Mateen, continued a killing spree that claimed 49 lives. He suffered significant psychological trauma from the incident, then America’s deadliest mass shooting, and has been confined to desk duty and light administrative tasks since returning to work eight months ago. Now, in a decision that Pulse co-founder Ron Legler has branded an injustice, the Eatonville police department is terminating Delgado’s contract from the end of this year. It means he will fall six months short of the 10 years’ service required for an annual pension of 64% of his $38,500 salary for life and, as an employee for less than a decade, he will receive only 42%. Eddie Cole, the Eatonville mayor, was unavailable for comment on Thursday, but at a town council meeting on Tuesday night said he could not discuss the reason for Delgado’s termination because of employee privacy. “This town, as well as me, cares about people. But some pictures are bigger than we all know,” the Orlando Sentinel reported Cole as saying. However, Delgado, 45, claims a superior officer told him the department needed an officer on patrol rather than at a desk, and that the PTSD for which he is still receiving counselling was a factor in the decision. “It’s a small town and we’re like a family,” Delgado told USA Today. “You don’t just throw a family member to the street. They’re acting like a Fortune 500 company and saying since you can’t do your job we’re going to replace you. Even if the world saw me as a hero, that was yesterday.” Legler, who founded the Pulse club in 2004 with his friend Barbara Poma after her brother’s death from HIV, said he would fight to have the decision overturned. “Know that you have a community of passionate people that will not rest until this wrong is made right,” Legler, president of Baltimore’s France-Merrick performing arts centre, wrote in a post on a GoFundMe account set up by a friend of Delgado to help his family with medical bills and the upcoming salary loss. “We will not let this injustice stand. We will all work as hard for you as you did for us that horrible night.” One of the injured victims that Delgado saved also came to his defence. Angel Colon, who was shot six times by Mateen and who became a close friend and supporter of the officer who helped him escape in the months afterwards, told WFTV: “For them to just do what they’re doing to him in front of my face is a slap to my face as well. “He did his job that night … so they should have his back 100% totally and just be there for whatever he needs.”",2017-12-07 13:59:32,Orlando police officer who saved Pulse shooting victims fired from force,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

352,https://nypost.com/2017/12/01/las-vegas-strip-takes-a-revenue-hit-in-month-after-massacre/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Associated Press Submit December 1, 2017 | 2:17am				| Updated December 1, 2017 | 4:39pm LAS VEGAS — Casinos on the Las Vegas Strip saw a 6 percent drop in revenue in October compared with the same month last year, but state’s gambling regulatory agency did not attribute the decrease exclusively to the mass shooting that took place in the city that month. Data released Thursday by the Nevada Gaming Control Board show casinos on the Strip took in almost $528.7 million from gamblers last month. That’s about $34 million less than what they won in October 2016. Casinos statewide faced a difficult comparison going into October since it had one fewer weekend day than the same month last year. In addition, the establishments on the Strip had seen a 14 percent revenue increase in October 2016. “I’m sure it played a part of it. I’m sure it played into the decrease, but it’s really difficult to quantify,” Michael Lawton, senior research analyst for the board, said. “What I can quantify, I can tell you that it was a difficult comparison.” On Oct. 1, a high-stakes gambler killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered windows of his hotel suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed withering gunfire at a country music festival below before killing himself. The city’s tourism officials also on Thursday reported that visitation to the gambling oasis last month fell 4.2 percent to 3.6 million tourists. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority blamed the drop to trip cancellations and postponements following the shooting. Statewide, casinos in Nevada won about $988.8 million last month. The revenue remained practically flat over the year. In southern Nevada, casinos in the Boulder Strip saw the highest increase in revenue with almost $78.7 million, a 17.1 percent jump compared with the previous year. Winnings in downtown Las Vegas were up 10 percent to about $63.6 million. Meanwhile, revenues at casinos in Washoe County were up 3.3 percent to about $71.9 million. The revenue report also shows that gamblers enthusiastically wagered at Nevada’s sports books. For the second month in a row, they broke the state’s all-time record for sports betting. People bet $566.4 million, of which the sports books took in $31.5 million, a decrease of 25.7 percent over the year. Baseball fans put down $101.5 million on their favorite teams, setting a record for betting on that sport for the month of October. “So, that can pretty much safely assume that the World Series was the most-heavily bet World Series ever,” Lawton said. The state benefited with almost $59.7 million in percentage fees based on the taxable revenues generated in October. That’s an increase of almost $79,000 or .13 percent from a year earlier.

353,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/newtown-parents-and-family-vow-lifelong-mission/,"Some of the parents and family of the 26 children and adults killed in the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., tell Scott Pelley their mission for gun control will last throughout their lifetimes Some of the parents and family of the 26 children and adults killed in the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., tell Scott Pelley their mission for gun control will last throughout their lifetimes.  Several parents and a husband of one of the victims of Adam Lanza's murder-suicide rampage last December spoke to Pelley in Newtown for a 60 Minutes report to be broadcast Sunday, April 7 at 7:00 p.m. ET/PT. A portion of the report was broadcast on the CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley. The following is a transcript: Among the families, we spoke with Nicole Hockley who lost 6-year-old Dylan and Bill Sherlach whose wife Mary was the school psychologist. Scott Pelley: In terms of the things that are being considered in Washington, are any of them at the top of your priority list? If you could have one thing or you could have two, what would you choose? Bill Sherlach: Personally, I would-- I would think the ma-- limiting magazine size and universal background check. If I had to pick two- Nicole Hockley: And anything that helps reduce-- gun trafficking as well, in the straw purchases, to know that you can't buy a gun for someone else. Scott Pelley: Straw purchases are those when a person who has a clean record buys a gun for a person who would not have been able to pass a background check? Nicole Hockley: Correct. And that-- Scott Pelley: It happens all the time. Nicole Hockley: That's common sense, isn't it? Scott Pelley: Do any of you fear that after only four months the impact of this on the Congress is beginning to fade, and the memory of how we felt on that day is beginning to fade? Bill Sherlach: This is-- this is a marathon. And you have to be prepared to run all 26 miles. This is not a sprint. That's been the typical reaction. Get the legislation. Get it now. And then it-- it fades. Time goes by. News cycles happen. Other headlines come up. Now when you take a multifaceted approach, and you can build a wagon big enough for a grassroots movement to get involved, it has the legs to go the 26 miles. Scott Pelley: This is a lifelong pursuit for all of you? Voices: Yes. Yeah. Bill Sherlach: Shame on me if it's not. Scott Pelley: How do you stay in touch with the child that you lost? Nicole Hockley: We had Dylan-- cremated. So-- I have his urn-- next to his picture-- in a cupboard in our bedroom-on our dresser. Every morning, I kiss him good morning and say, ""Hi."" And he's-- the last thing I kiss before I go to bed at night. Every night I beg for him to come to me in my dreams so that I can see him again. And-- during the day, I just focus on what I need to do to honor him and make change.

354,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/arts/10-cultural-battles-that-ruled-2017.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Jennifer Schuessler Of all the sequels and franchise extensions in 2017, none were as ambitious as the reboot of the culture wars starring Donald J. Trump. He swept into office with the swagger of a one-man Justice League, bent on vanquishing the liberal-leaning entertainment industrial complex and its coastal elite base, one tweet at a time. The phrase “culture war” first crashed into the national discourse in the late 1980s, as a catchall term for battles over values, ideals and national identity. The battlegrounds were college campuses, Hollywood, the bedroom — anywhere that moral relativism, secularism and the general “culture of depravity,” as dedicated warriors like Rush Limbaugh put it, held sway. Today’s culture wars, like war itself, have moved beyond the old, clearly defined fields of contention and are just as likely to rage among old allies as traditional right-left antagonists. Here’s a selective, not-so-nostalgic look back at some of the fiercest fights from a year when just about every cultural event and artifact became an arena for asking not just “Which side are you on?” but “Do you really have my back?” If there was any lingering hope that President Trump was going to cede the stage to a more restrained character, it was laid to rest at the Golden Globes on Jan. 8, when Hollywood served up the making of a classic culture wars set piece. The erstwhile Trump tousler Jimmy Fallon was the host, but it was Meryl Streep who volunteered as Mr. Trump’s scene partner. She unleashed a fiery speech that called out his mocking imitation of a disabled reporter during the campaign — a performance that “sank its hooks into my heart” — and extolled the open borders of culture. “Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners,” she declared. “If we kick them out, you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.” The room, and the internet, erupted in cheers. Conservative pundits accused her of elitist grandstanding, while on Twitter Mr. Trump called her “one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood” and “a Hillary flunky who lost big.” Two weeks later, at a gala in New York, Ms. Streep attempted a rollback on at least one target. “I do like football — let me just make that clear,” she said. Some M.M.A. fans, meanwhile, pointed out that the sport, which was brought to the United States by a Brazilian family that had studied jujitsu, is not only creative, but also more diverse than Hollywood. Ms. Streep may get a do-over at this year’s Golden Globes on Jan. 7; she is nominated for her portrayal of the newspaper publisher Katharine Graham, another woman who faced down a president, in Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama, “The Post.” The Women’s March spurred millions of protesters in pink “pussy hats” to take to the streets across the country the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. It was a show of strength for the Resistance, but also a trailer for the internecine battles to follow. Signs pointed out the awkward fact that 53 percent of white women had voted for Mr. Trump. The pink hat itself was denounced as racist and transphobic. Some two months later, Hulu’s adaptation of “The Handmaid’s Tale” provided another sartorial rallying point, as protesters dressed in blood-red cloaks and white bonnets descended on various state capitals to challenge cuts to funding for reproductive health care. But what did those hats, and the show, really mean? The fictional Republic of Gilead as an allegory of Trump’s America drew scoffs from conservatives, some of whom argued that its vision of sexual slavery could also be read as a parable about assisted reproduction. And on the left, some asked why nonwhite women (who in Margaret Atwood’s novel had been shipped to segregated colonies in the Midwest) were present, thanks to colorblind casting, but largely marginalized, while the actual history of slavery in the United States was ignored. The show “isn’t really the future,” Jenn M. Jackson of the Black Youth Project wrote. “It more closely resembles the lived past of black women in the United States, just wrapped in cloaks and creepy white bonnets.” Mr. Trump’s Jan. 25 executive order calling for the construction of a border wall and temporarily suspending immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations brought demonstrators out into the streets again. Even some Super Bowl ads had a marked pro-immigrant slant (though the original ending of one from 84 Lumber, which featured a truck bearing Spanish-speaking migrants running smack into a wall, was deemed too controversial by Fox and changed). Few in the arts world saw it as a moment for anything but resistance. When news outlets highlighted some entirely theoretical proposals that sneaked “subversive design” into the idea of a border wall (including a wall made of cactuses and another that doubled as a xylophone), the architects were blasted for turning a moral crisis into a design opportunity. “Miami Firm Proposes ‘Sustainable’ Hipster Moat for Trump’s Racist Wall” ran one headline. The French photographer JR earned better reviews for his more pointed (and Instagram-friendly) intervention: a nearly 70-foot photograph of a baby peering over the existing barrier bordering San Diego County. Installed on the Mexican side, in the city of Tecate, it was fully visible only from the United States. Jordan Peele scored a No. 1 movie in February with “Get Out,” a satire of the ways white liberal racism loves black bodies to death, while accusations of more direct cultural body snatching — and the question of who has the right to represent black pain — dogged white artists throughout the year. After the Whitney Biennial opened in March, some African-American artists called for the removal, even the destruction, of “Open Casket,” Dana Schutz’s painting based on the famous photographs of Emmett Till’s mutilated corpse. “The subject matter is not Schutz’s,” the artist Hannah Black wrote on Facebook, calling contemporary art “a fundamentally white supremacist institution despite all our nice friends.” In a statement, Ms. Schutz said the painting was born of empathy with Till’s mother. “I don’t know what it is like to be black in America,” she said. “But I do know what it is like to be a mother.” The year saw plenty of full-throated paeans to cultural appropriation, which argued that borrowing and mixing were the engines of culture itself. But when Kathryn Bigelow’s “Detroit,” set during the riots of 1967, was accused of appropriating black stories and black pain, she defended herself by agreeing with the charge — sort of. “Am I the perfect person to tell this story? No,” she told Variety. “However, I am able to tell this story, and it’s been 50 years since it was told.” If you come at the king, you best not miss — or, if you’re joking, at least get ready for the inevitable guerrilla warfare over the limits of art, free speech and satire. When Kathy Griffin tweeted out a photograph of herself holding the bloody, severed head of Mr. Trump, she found few defenders and was promptly fired from her gig hosting CNN’s New Year’s Eve special. But the conversation became a pitched partisan battle a week later, when a bootleg video from the Shakespeare in the Park production of “Julius Caesar” was posted online showing the very bloody assassination of a very Trump-like Caesar. Breitbart, Fox News and other outlets pumped the story with headlines like “Senators Stab Trump to Death in Central Park Performance of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar.” Corporate sponsors withdrew support or distanced themselves. After Donald Trump Jr. asked on Twitter if the play had any taxpayer funding, the National Endowment for the Arts (which had been marked for elimination by the Trump administration) felt compelled to issue a statement saying it had no connection with the production. “Lefty Actors Are Beginning to Fear Trump,” National Review declared. But others wondered why conservatives who love to champion free speech against the forces of political correctness were suddenly melting like snowflakes. Since the debate over whitewashing broke out, those looking for more representation of Asian-Americans in movies have had to settle for justice via meme. Last year’s #StarringJohnCho campaign had cast the Korean-American actor (via Photoshop) in just about everything, with no measurable effect on his real-life credits. When “Ghost in the Shell,” which had stirred controversy with its casting of Scarlett Johansson as a cyborg whose name is Major Motoko Kusanagi in the anime original, opened in March, unhappy fans weaponized the movie’s promotional meme generator, transforming the tagline “I Am Major” into variations like “I Am in Love With White Feminism.” Ms. Johansson defended herself by arguing that the character “has a human brain in an entirely machinate body,” and said, “I would never attempt to play a person of a different race, obviously.” Then, in August, an online outcry actually prompted a white actor to back out of a role in the reboot of “Hellboy.” Ed Skrein made his decision less than a week after the announcement that he would play a character who is half-Japanese in the original comic book series. “I accepted the role unaware that the character in the original comics was of mixed Asian heritage,” Mr. Skrein said in a statement. “It is clear,” he added, “that representing this character in a culturally accurate way holds significance for people, and that to neglect this responsibility would continue a worrying tendency to obscure ethnic minority stories and voice in the arts.” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Man in the High Castle” may have been embraced by some as perversely inspirational tales of resistance to the Trumpian present. But the vogue for high-concept historical what-ifs ran into a brick wall of a different kind of resistance in July when HBO unveiled plans for “Confederate,” a new series from the lauded creators of “Game of Thrones” set in an alternative present in which the South had successfully seceded and slavery was still legal. The media activist April Reign, the creator of the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag, started a #NoConfederate campaign, which flooded Twitter during Season 7 of “Game of Thrones.” Despite the involvement of two well-regarded black writer-producers, the show was dismissed by skeptics as Lost Cause nostalgia dressed up in progressive prestige-cable clothing, or even “slavery fan fiction.” “Confederate” had a few defenders, like Judd Apatow, who said on Twitter that criticizing a show before it even existed amounted to “censorship,” but then backed away from that word. A month later, tiki-torch-wielding white supremacists rallied in Charlottesville, Va., to protest the slated removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. Mr. Trump reacted to the violent clashes there, during which one counterprotester was killed by a white supremacist, by praising the “very fine people on both sides.” Not a single scene of “Confederate” had been shot, but maybe we were watching it already? First they came for Pepe the Frog, New Balance shoes and Jane Austen. But when the alt-right came for Taylor Swift, things (as all things Taylor tend to do) got complicated. The white nationalists’ appropriation of the singer first drew headlines in 2016, when the editor of the Daily Stormer called her “a pure Aryan goddess.” It came crawling out of the grave again in August, when Breitbart News mysteriously spent a day tweeting out lyrics from her single “Look What You Made Me Do.” Then in November, after the album “Reputation” was released, a blogger for the obscure site Pop Front called for Ms. Swift to explicitly repudiate white nationalism, and suggested that her music might be a gateway drug for Nazi-curious young fans. Ms. Swift’s lawyers sent a letter to the blogger demanding a retraction, only to get a rebuke from the American Civil Liberties Union of California, criticizing what it called an effort to suppress constitutionally protected free speech. A few weeks later, The Guardian ran an editorial suggesting that Ms. Swift, with her feud-prone ways (and social media army of rabid fan enforcers), was “an envoy for Trump’s values,” if not necessarily a Trump supporter. That editorial drew baffled reactions, but the question remains, When it comes to politics, how long can Taylor refuse to come to the phone? Mainstream country music generally steers clear of politics, beyond heartwarming tributes to America and the occasional rabble-rousing patriotic song. But after the mass shooting at a festival in Las Vegas in October left 58 fans dead and 500 more wounded, some cracks in the industry’s solidarity with American gun culture began to appear. A few stars, including Blake Shelton and Florida Georgia Line, issued statements distancing themselves from the National Rifle Association. Before the Country Music Association Awards, the group’s threats to revoke the credentials of any journalist who attempted to talk about “the Las Vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like” drew intense criticism from artists, suggesting not everyone wanted to shut up and sing. The show opened with a somber tribute to the victims of the shooting and the hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, but no one went full Dixie Chick, or even mildly Meryl Streep. Instead, the hosts, Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood, who had started out by declaring the show a “politics-free zone,” offered up “Before He Tweets,” a lighthearted parody of Mr. Trump’s Twitter habits to the tune of Ms. Underwood’s “Before He Cheats.” As the list of the men felled by allegations of sexual harassment and assault grew longer, the Weinstein Effect was shadowed by what might be called the Louis C. K. Conundrum. The offending men were gone (for now at least), but was it still O.K. to like — or even look at — their work? While fans debated the politics of erasure, corporations made some of the decisions for us, for their own reasons, as books, television shows, movies and other projects were canceled or altered. Facing the social media calls for a boycott of the upcoming movie “All the Money in the World,” Sony spent about $10 million to reshoot 22 scenes with Christopher Plummer in which Kevin Spacey (who was accused of multiple incidents of sexual misconduct, including sexual assault of a minor) had appeared. A poet named Isobel O’Hare took a more low-budget approach, turning the offending men’s mea (sorta) culpas into “erasure” poems by blacking out most of their words to reveal blunter messages. “Every man on Earth is bewildered,” read her redacted version of a statement by Richard Dreyfuss, who was accused of harassing a female writer (he recalled their interactions as part of a “mutual seduction ritual”). “I have to step away from the fun, but I am comfortable and safe,” read Ms. O’Hare’s take on Mario Batali’s apology. Perhaps to underline that point, a second apology by Mr. Batali, included in his weekly newsletter, ended with a recipe for Pizza Dough Cinnamon Rolls. With entertainment and political figures seeming to topple daily, America is unlikely to trade its culture wars for a friendly bake-off anytime soon.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. An AR-15 rifle found at the scene of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012. The shooting killed 20 children and six educators. (Reuters) The U.S. Army and the Department of Homeland Security have created a computer-based simulator that trains teachers on how best to react in an active-shooter situation. The $5.6 million program – it's called the Enhanced Dynamic Geo-Social Environment, or EDGE – is similar to those used by the Army, in which a virtual environment helps train soldiers in combat tactics and scenarios. The program is expanding to schools to allow teachers and other school personnel to train for active shooters alongside first responders. Homeland Security officials said the school version should be ready for launch by spring. ""With teachers, they did not self-select into a role where they expect to have bullets flying near them,"" said Tamara Griffith, a chief engineer for the project. ""Unfortunately, it's becoming a reality. We want to teach teachers how to respond as first responders."" 5 YEARS AFTER NEWTOWN, NO EASY ANSWERS IN GUN DEBATE Bob Walker, the project manager, said the program was designed to put a teacher in a situation similar to an active-shooter scenario. Each teacher will get seven options on how to keep students safe, and some in the program might not respond or be too afraid to react. That, in itself, becomes another problem to be solved. ""Once you hear the children, the screaming, it makes it very, very real,"" Walker said. The program can have the shooter be either an adult or a child. ""We have to worry about both children and adults being suspects,"" he said. The designers of the program listened to real dispatch tapes from school shootings and talked to a mother of a child killed in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. That shooting left 20 children and six educators dead after gunman Adam Lanza opened fire in the school. HOUSE APPROVES CONCEALED-CARRY RECIPROCITY, GUN BILL FACES CHALLENGE IN SENATE ""It gives you chills when you think about what's happening on those tapes,"" Griffith said. ""It tore us apart to listen to her and what she went through."" The goal of EDGE was to serve one purpose: to train educators to save lives when an armed attacker busts through a school door, weapons at the ready. School safety advocates say safety training gets pushed to the back burner until a tragedy happens. Amanda Klinger, director of operations for the nonprofit Educator's School Safety Network, said this new program could help change that. ""I hope that people will sort of see this simulation as a really cool and engaging way,"" she said, ""to think about school safety."" John Verrico, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security told Fox News the program was free for administrators and teachers to download and the program was implemented partly due to concerns of active shooter situations at schools. ""These active shooting scenarios are what we wanted to focus on first,"" Verrico told Fox News. Verrico could not elaborate if the program would be mandatory for educators but said it was a good way for teachers to train with police if these situations were to occur. Everytown reported there have been 271 school shootings in the U.S. since 2013. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

356,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/z3g0HSpKF_I/,"On December 14, 2017, CNN’s Jim Acosta claimed America has witnessed “1,552 mass shootings” since the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School. This means Acosta is claiming an average of approximately 310 mass shootings a year for each of the past five years. It is important to note that he attempts to bolster this claim via information provided by a tracking site sponsored by gun controllers. That tracking site–the Gun Violence Archive–diverges from FBI definition of a mass shooting as four fatalities or more in one incident so as to include shootings in which no fatalities occur. Acosta tweeted: Since Sandy Hook there have been at least 1,552 mass shootings, with at least 1,767 people killed and 6,227 wounded. https://t.co/RZeFDHhYmR — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) December 14, 2017 Other members of the left have been spewing similar numbers for years. At times, their claims have gotten so outlandish that members of their own circles have called them out for it. For example, in December 2015 Breitbart News reported that Mother Jones’ editor Mark Follman called out leftists for claiming “355 mass shootings” in that calendar year alone. Follman published a column in the The New York Times, which said: At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four “mass shootings” this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982. Note–using the actual FBI definition of mass shootings, Follman could only find four mass shootings for the entire year, yet leftists were claiming 355. Think about it this way–It is easy to swell the number of car accidents recorded for a given year if butterflies hitting the windshield are counted as an accident. Moreover, it is easy to swell the number of falls recorded every year if stumbling without actually falling is counting as a fall nonetheless. In the same way, it is easy to swell the number of mass shootings if the definition of mass shooting is changed so as to include street crimes in which no one is killed or by including the life of the attacker in the reported number of deaths resulting from an alleged shooting. The Gun Violence Archive does both these things and Acosta’s tweet ultimately rests on that approach to claim “1552 mass shootings” during the past five years.

357,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nicole-lovell-murder-smartphone-predator-stranger-danger-killer-app/,"""48 Hours"" investigates the murder of Nicole Lovell,13, and the hidden dangers of connecting online with strangers Produced by Josh Yager [This story first aired on Sept. 24, 2016. It was updated on June 3, 2017.] BLACKSBURG, Va. -- ""Every morning … I come out here, sit with her for an hour,"" Tammy Weeks said while visiting her daughter's grave. ""It's just been a nightmare … I still hope that she would come around the corner when she gets off the bus … or she'll come out of her room,"" Weeks said in tears. The nightmare for Nicole Lovell's mother began on the morning of Jan. 27, 2016. ""I pushed the door open, and the nightstand was up against the door,"" Weeks told ""48 Hours"" correspondent Peter Van Sant. ""That night … I was gonna knock on the wall and tell her to come in … and sleep with me like she usually does … and I didn't do it,"" she said tearfully. Sometime in the middle of the night, the 13-year-old had climbed out of her bedroom window taking along her phone and her favorite blue cartoon blanket. ""Did you call her cell phone?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""Oh yeah, a bunch of times,"" she replied. ""And what would happen?"" ""It'd go -- straight to voicemail.  I text-messaged her, everybody was calling her.  Texting her,"" said Weeks. Weeks called police and began scouring the area. Before long, a neighborhood mother gave her some chilling news. ""Nicole had been playing with her … daughters and said that Nicole had said she was goin' out on a date,"" said Weeks. Like millions of teens, Nicole spent a lot of her social time online. So Weeks feared she might have left to see someone she'd met on the internet. ""You must be a bit panicked at this point?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""Yeah,"" she replied. Local News Report: The FBI has now joined regional and state law enforcement in the search.  This afternoon they canvassed from neighborhood… Nicole's disappearance also sent shockwaves through her hometown of Blacksburg, Virginia, the scene of that infamous 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. Blacksburg Police press conference:  This community is known for stepping up and we need them to do that at this time as we pray for the return of a beautiful young girl. By midday, Blacksburg was stepping up again. WDBJ News report: More than 1,200 searchers are on a mission to find the 13-year-old. Volunteers even brought an infrared drone to aid in the search for Nicole. ""I know she wouldn't go nowhere for that many hours without her medicine,"" said Weeks. Nicole was born with a damaged liver and needed a transplant before her first birthday. Now a teenager, she still needed her anti-rejection medication every day to survive.  Her illness and surgical treatment had left Nicole with scars on her stomach and neck. Weeks says Nicole had emotional scars as well. ""So she was being bullied?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yeah. She hated going to school,"" Weeks replied. ""She would always make me write her a note for gym because they would pick on her about her scar."" Nicole's social media posts reveal a sadly typical teenage story: so lonely she'd had suicidal thoughts, longing for love and convinced nobody cared about her. Weeks says Nicole not only had trouble fitting in, she also had a difficult relationship with her father, David Lovell. He did prison time on a drug charge and he's had other problems with the law. ""She wanted his attention,"" Weeks said. ""She wanted his love."" ""I have regrets that I wasn't there. I feel … you know, what did I do wrong, why wasn't I there for her more often,"" said Lovell. He'd left Tammy before Nicole was born. The two were never married. ""When you would go to work, was there anyone supervising her?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""Yeah, my parents,"" she replied. ""Your parents, did they live at the house?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yes."" ""So she never went unsupervised?"" ""No,"" said Weeks. But Nicole was leading an unsupervised life online through the social media apps on her smartphone. ""It's like a loaded gun,"" said Pamela Casey, a district attorney in Blount County, Ala., who is on a national crusade warning people about the dangers of social media. ""This is the new crime of our time,"" she said. Pamela Casey PSA: If you pick up your child's phone and you don't know the password, that's a problem.  If you don't know… Casey began speaking out long before Nicole Lovell disappeared in Virginia. Her online safety videos have been seen by millions across the country. Pamela Casey PSA: I can actually go live on Periscope and post updates to you guys… if I can do that live sitting in my office, then your child can do that live in their bedroom. ""Years ago, you had to worry about your kid getting snatched.  Parents don't realize that essentially your kid could get snatched -- their life taken by somebody they meet in their own bedroom,"" said Casey. By late on the day Nicole Lovell vanished, her parents' hope was fading with the winter light. ""I didn't sleep at all that night, I waited…"" said Weeks. But it would be three days before Nicole's parents had to face the horrifying news that her body had been found. ""Your whole world just comes tumbling down,"" Weeks cried, ""because she was my everything."" ""Coley had a passion for pandas, music, dancing ... Nicole touched many people throughout her short life,"" Weeks said at a press conference the day she got the news, referring to Nicole by her nickname. Weeks was quickly was overcome by emotion and left the podium. Shock and sadness were everywhere, but investigators had gotten a big break. And it came from Nicole Lovell herself. She'd left behind virtual evidence of a real-life murder. Nicole's dad, David Lovell, says even before her body was found, investigators had found a solid lead -- she had handwritten the usernames and passwords to all her accounts on her bedroom wall. FBI computer forensics experts traced Nicole's account information and quickly established that she'd regularly used Kik – a popular chat app attractive to teens, in part, because they can communicate anonymously without their parents knowing. ""When you had her phone, did you ever click on the Kik app just to see what was inside?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""No,"" she replied.""I just made her delete it, uninstall it."" ""Do you believe she reinstalled it? ""Yeah,"" said Weeks. So the FBI put in what they call an emergency disclosure request to Kik. They wanted to see Nicole's personal account, and they make a startling discovery.  It turns out that in the last two days of her life, she'd been messaging with a person who had a chilling username: ""Dr_Tombstone."" Using an IP address provided by Kik, investigators traced the Dr_Tombstone screen name to David Eisenhauser, 18, a freshman engineering student at Virginia Tech. David Eisenhauer seemed the last person in the world capable of killing a 13-year-old girl.  He'd been a high school track star. Former classmate Dorothy Callahan says his brains and charisma were as strong as his strides. ""He was a very celebrated student, he always had straight A's,"" Callahan said. ""And he was sort of cocky, and he was like, 'Yeah I'm David Eisenhauer, I was just on the local news. I'm a big deal.'"" Three days after Nicole went missing, Eisenhauer was picked up by police at his dorm and taken in for questioning. His roommate, Jeremy Basdeo, walked in on the startling aftermath. ""I went to my room and I saw the door open,"" he said. ""And I got turned around by the Virginia State Police and the FBI."" ""And what did they say?"" Van Sant asked. ""They said, 'Don't worry.  It's not about you.  It's about your roommate,'"" he replied. Basdeo told ""48 Hours"" that Eisenhauer's behavior the night Nicole Lovell vanished was really odd. ""He put on boots. But it wasn't raining that hard for boots. But, you know, I just let it go. And then -- he came back at 2:00 in the morning,"" Basdeo continued. ""Did you ever see a knife in the room?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""He usually leaves[s] it on his desk."" ""Was it on his desk when the cops showed up?"" Van Sant asked. ""No. They couldn't find it,"" said Basdeo. Eisenhauer soon admitted to police he'd talked to Nicole outside her house that night. He was arrested and charged with abduction. Eisenhauer's statements led them to another young woman, Natalie Keepers. She was brought in for questioning, too. What did 19-year-old Natalie Keepers know about what happened to Nicole Lovell? Keepers -- another Virginia Tech freshman and another unlikely person of interest. ""She wanted to study engineering and be like her father who worked for NASA,"" Mark Jenkins, a former boyfriend, told ""48 Hours."" Investigators strongly suspected Keepers was involved.  She too was arrested. With  two people in custody, police made a grisly discovery. Nicole Lovell's nude body was located 90 miles away in North Carolina. ""What kind of wounds were on her body?"" Van Sant asked Surry County Sheriff Graham Atkinson. ""She was stabbed… her throat was cut,"" he replied. ""…and then the thoughts turn to, 'who are the animals who could have done something like this to her?'"" District Attorney Pamela Casey said Eisenhauer and Keepers may represent a new kind of predator. ""Sometimes it's usually the people we least expect,"" Casey warned. ""They could be your next door neighbor,"" she said. ""…they can stay behind their phone and hide behind their phone -- just like your child is doin'."" Casey said criminals often use apps like Kik. Why? Because it's where kids hang out online. In fact, Kik -- a Canadian company -- claims that millions of American teens use their app every month. ""You can be anybody…"" said a convicted predator we'll call ""Steve."" He should know. ""Steve,"" 38, said he used the Internet to groom kids and spent 10 years in prison for molestation. He told ""48 Hours"" he now feels a new urge to sound the alarm about anonymous chat apps like Kik. ""Kik … is a predator's paradise,"" he said. ""Pedophiles, do they go on Kik, pose as a 13, 14, 15-year-old in order to hopefully strike up a relationship with a child?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yes, that's quite common on there,"" ""Steve"" replied. ""Steve"" demonstrated just how easy it is for an adult to use the Kik app to begin a conversation with a child. We created -- and later deleted -- a Kik account for the demonstration. ""Steve"" showed how us how the app could be used to target children. ""My message is: 'I'm sad and lonely,'"" said ""Steve"". After hitting send, it took just 44 seconds for the first response to arrive.  Another girl, apparently a teenager, responded less than three minutes later. ""In two days max, I could have her sending me nude pictures,"" ""Steve"" said. ""Once you make 'em happy, you got their heart, once you got their heart, everything else follows."" Three months had passed since Nicole Lovell's murder. With David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers still behind bars, investigators had discovered text messages that led them to the door of Bryce Dustin. ""I almost felt like he was like a little brother, Dustin said of Eisenhauer. It was on a gaming site that Dustin first chatted with Eisenhauer. And though they never met in person, they began a six-year-long internet friendship. ""David, you know, kept coming back to me for advice on everything,"" said Dustin. ""What kind of problems would he ask you for advice about?"" Van Sant asked. ""Girls was a big one,"" Dustin replied. Dustin told ""48 Hours"" he remembers Eisenhauer talking last winter about a problem he had with one girl in particular, a girl Dustin now believes was Nicole Lovell. ""He told me that he had found out she was underage and that … she wanted to be with him. And that she was going to expose him if he wasn't with her,"" he recalled. He said Eisenhauer was worried about being outed in a relationship with an underage girl. So he offered some big brother kind of advice. ""If she wants to be your girlfriend, you know, let her, but don't be the greatest boyfriend, just like don't text her, just ignore her,"" Dustin advised. ""…she'll go away."" Another family was about to have one of their daughters go away as well -- in the car of an online predator in Spokane, Washington. ""Her last moments, is what flashes through my mind. That's my nightmare,"" said Nicole's father, David Lovell. Lovell says he wishes he had done better in protecting Nicole. ""If it can happen to my family, it can happen to anybody. I mean, flat out anybody,"" he said. It can happen to any family, including one in Spokane, Washington, about 2,500 miles away from Virginia. The parents here got a tip that their 15-year-old daughter was being targeted by a 30-year-old man. And what's worse? The two were planning to run away that very night. ""She was gonna leave her iPad, hop in the car … with a man she doesn't really even know,"" said Detective Elise Robertson. It was June 7, 2013, when Detective Robertson of the Spokane Police Department's Special Victims Unit got the kind of call cops all over the country have come to expect. ""A father was saying that his daughter was having an Internet relationship with a 30-year-old man and he had just found out…"" she said. ""And that's when everything broke loose,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. Until that moment, Brandy, and her husband, Branden Syrotchen, seemed to have the quintessential American family. She, teaching at a local church, he studying for a PhD in Psychology. They'd been hands-on parents, raising their sons, Joshua and Josiah, and daughters Ariel and Elizabeth. They shared a love of God, country, sports and each other. ""My parents were pretty strict,"" said Elizabeth Syrotchen. Elizabeth, now over 18, says it wasn't always easy reconciling her upbringing with a growing lust for life. ""I felt like my parents were holding me back from what the average kid gets to experience,"" she said. ""And how much did your parents monitor your life?"" Van Sant asked. ""I would say that they thought that they were monitoring me … they didn't understand that they actually weren't monitoring me,"" she explained. ""They probably had no clue about Kik and those dating sites."" But her parents did become suspicious when Elizabeth, then 15, suddenly started acting strangely. ""She would be going to bed earlier than normal,"" her father said. Elizabeth seemed distracted -- less interested in family activities, in church, and even in friends.  Her parents took her smartphone away and asked to see her social media accounts. She refused. ""At that point you're like, 'OK, something's really wrong here,'"" said Brandy Syrotchen. They were stunned to learn just how wrong.  It all started with a phone call from Elizabeth's best friend's mother … a call that turned their world upside down. ""Elizabeth is dating a 30-year-old …And he plans on coming down and … getting her at 3 o'clock in the morning,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. ""That very day?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yeah. And we're like, ""W—what???"" Brandy replied. Elizabeth was angry and evasive, but her parents finally got her passwords and soon discovered the truth. She had been communicating with a stranger: a 30-year-old Seattle-area man named Jason. ""Jason Richards says, 'When I see you, baby, I am grabbing you. Pulling you close to me. And holding you tightly,'"" Brandy Syrotchen tearfully read aloud from her daughter's correspondence with the man. ""And what does Elizabeth say?"" Van Sant asked. ""'No kiss?' And Jason says, 'Baby, I'm gonna kiss you deeply,'"" Brandy continued. ""This guy's evil. She's fooled. She's lured in,"" said Branden Syrotchen. The communications show that initially, Elizabeth told Jason she was 18, but later admitted her real age: 15.  The Syrotchens were stunned to learn that the pair had already met in person and been intimate. They were even discussing leaving the country. The two had used apps including Facebook and Kik. ""This is playing out in some ways like your own personal family horror film,"" Van Sant commented to Elizabeth's parents. ""Yeah,"" they replied. The horror continued as the Syrotchens realized that within hours, Jason would be driving the 280 miles from Seattle to Spokane to pick up their daughter. They locked Elizabeth in her room with no phone or Internet access and called police. ""'This guy wants to kidnap my daughter tonight. He's planning to kidnap my daughter tonight,'"" said Branden Syrotchen. ""Were your hands kind of tied?"" Van Sant asked Det. Robertson. ""What do you do at that moment? You have a 15-year-old girl who's your only witness who's denying everything,"" the detective said. Detective Robertson says that without hard evidence of an actual crime, police had to stay on the sidelines. ""So there's nothing they can do for you?"" Van Sant asked the Syrotchens. ""There's absolutely nothing they can do for me,"" Branden replied. ""And when you hear that you feel totally helpless. And it's, like, 'OK, well, what are you gonna do now?'"" said Brandy. What they did was hatch their own plan to turn the tables on the man who was about to lure their daughter away. ""This is my daughter and nobody's gonna mess with her and nobody's gonna get her.  And I'm gonna do what it takes,"" said Brandy. Jason had already messaged from the car. ""I needed to communicate with him to get him to our house,"" Brandy explained. Gritting her teeth, Brandy Syrotchen went online -- impersonating her own daughter. ""For seven hours, I sat there and listened to him, 'Oh baby I can't wait to see you … I can't wait to get you in my arms …lay in the same bed together, wake up in the morning,'"" she said in tears. ""And for seven hours I communicated back, 'Oh baby, I love you too …I can't wait.'"" ""In the pit of your stomach that must have made you …"" Van Sant began. ""It made me sick!"" she said. ""Jason is getting ever closer to your house, ever closer to your daughter,"" Van Sant noted. Standing in the alley behind the Syrotchen's house, Branden told Van Sant, ""My wife was up there and she was on the iPad."" ""She's communicating with him. Posing as your daughter,"" said Van Sant. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""Exactly. Yes"" Branden recalled that Brandy kept the conversation with Jason Richards going, in the alley behind the Syrotchen's house, he and his friends had set up a sting operation like something out of an action movie. As Branden waited in his car on one side of the alley getting updates from his wife on the phone, his friend, Damon, waited in his car on the other side of the street. ""So the idea is like a pincer, right, you're gonna trap.  It's like a bear trap that's gonna close,"" said Van Sant. ""Yes,"" Branden affirmed. Branden's friend, Phil, brought his 12-gauge shotgun. He'd been trained in Special Forces and had no idea how Jason would react. It was 3 a.m. in Spokane, Washington, but could just as easily been high noon. As Branden Syrotchen and his team lay in wait, headlights appeared at one end of the alley.  A 30-year-old man's sexual road trip to take a 15-year-old girl from her family was about to come to a shocking end. ""He pulls in. At this time, we go ahead and we call Damon down here. And Damon-- just books it,"" Branden explained. ""I'm pulling in here … Jason pulls in right there."" Branden's friend, Phil, quickly approached the vehicle, shotgun raised. ""I said …'Driver … Put your hands on the steering wheel. Do not move or I will shoot you. …Couple of times he moved his hands and I said, 'What part of do not move do you not understand?'"" Phil demonstrated. ""If Jason makes some sort of move, are you prepared to pull that trigger?"" Van Sant asked. ""If he exited the car abruptly, I would've shot him,"" Phil replied. They called police, who arrived minutes later and arrested Jason. In his SUV, they found cell phones and a pair of hunting knives. They would later discover he also owned a handgun. ""He was caught but it wasn't over,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. Ninety minutes later, Jason came face-to-face with Spokane Det. Elise Robertson in a videotaped interrogation: Det. Robertson: So Jason, tell me a little bit about yourself. Jason Richards: I work for Royal Cup Coffee. Detective Robertson learned Jason was actually Jason Richards, a 30-year-old, divorced coffee distributer from the Seattle area. Like David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers in the Lovell case, Jason Richards seemed nice and successful on the surface. ""Who is this guy?"" Van Sant asked the detective. ""Jason is the guy next door,"" she replied. He tried to turn his crime into a love story: Jason Richards: I pretty much fell for her very quickly … we said ""I love you"" pretty quickly, about a week and a half into really talking with each other. At first, Richards insisted he had no idea Elizabeth was only 15 until a policeman told him at the time of his arrest. Jason Richards: He told me that she wasn't 18. Det. Robertson: OK. Jason Richards: I responded, ""Come again?"" And I'm like, ""She's, no she's 18."" ""He was lying, the whole time he was lying. The whole time, over, and over, and over, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie,"" Det. Robertson told Van Sant. To see if her instincts were right, Detective Robertson asked to see Richards' Facebook page. There were literally hundreds of exchanges between him and Elizabeth. ""And I start looking at it and I realize, 'Oh, he knew, he knew before he ever came over here she was 15,'"" Det. Robertson remembered. ""I looked right at him and I said … 'So are you gonna tell me the truth now?"" Det. Robertson: Wanna tell me the truth now? Jason Richards: I fell in love with her. And I didn't know what to do. Det. Robertson: And she told you that she was 15 and still in school? Jason Richards: Eventually. Det. Robertson: Right. Elizabeth told her parents she was going jogging, but instead came to a parking lot near her house. ""This is our first meeting spot,"" Elizabeth told Van Sant at the lot. ""When you actually saw him face-to-face, what did you think?"" he asked. ""'Holy crap,' like, I think it became a reality to me that it's not just somebody that I'm talking to over the Internet!"" she replied. Elizabeth says Jason took her to a hotel, got down on one knee and proposed marriage -- and then they got in bed.  In the following weeks, he came to town again. ""On those visits you did have sex with him each time?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yeah, we did,"" Elizabeth replied. ""For you, Jason is what?"" Van Sant asked Det. Robertson. ""He's a sexual predator,"" she replied. Jason Richards: I've completely just f----d up my life. ""My life was destroyed,"" said Elizabeth. The events of that chaotic day still seem to haunt the Syrotchens, too. ""This hits you right now like a punch across the face,"" Van Sant commented to Branden. ""It's just absolutely unbelievable,"" he replied in tears. ""This guy found out that she was a minor and that's --and then after that's when he decided to sleep with her,"" Branden continued. Richards pleaded guilty to child rape and communication with a minor for immoral purposes.  His lawyer argued Richards has autism, which can be a mitigating factor for several crimes in Washington State. He got a light sentence: three years. ""When you learned that Jason was in jail?"" Van San ""It broke me,"" Elizabeth told Van Sant. Inexperienced at love, Elizabeth says her online connection with Jason had been instant. ""Everything progresses faster online because you're just more comfortable,"" she explained. ""...you don't have to talk to that person in person."" District Attorney Pamela Casey says far too many internet predators are turning to apps like Kik, and their alleged crimes are making headlines across the U.S.—more crimes than Facebook and Instagram users combined. In May, disgraced ex-N.Y. congressman Anthony Weiner pleaded guilty to a federal obscenity charge for sexting with a 15-year-old girl, using social media believed to include Kik. Back in Spokane, Van Sant asked Elizabeth, ""Did you fall in love with Jason?"" ""Yeah, I did,"" she replied. ""I hate to say it, but part of me still loves him."" But Elizabeth didn't really have the whole story about Jason Richards. In fact, she may not have been his one true love. On Richards' phone, Det. Robertson had discovered graphic photos of young women and men. ""What's your reaction to all that?"" Van Sant asked Elizabeth. Stunned, and in tears, she stood up and left the interview room. About 10 minutes later, she returned. ""Do you want to say anything?"" Van Sant asked Elizabeth. ""I just feel so fooled. Like, for three years I've been defending him and it's not right, it's not right,"" she replied. Seeing some of Jason's graphic photo collection for herself drives home the point. ""That's a lot of pictures though, of a lot of different women …oh…and a man,"" she said looking at the photos on a computer. ""Honestly, if anything, it makes me feel better. …It's going to be easier for me to move on."" Looking back, Elizabeth's mother, Brandy Syrotchen, says she wishes the judge had given Jason Richards as much as life in prison. But back in Virginia, Nicole Lovell's mother says there is no punishment severe enough for the accused predators. ""I want both of 'em to suffer,"" said Tammy Weeks. And she says Eisenhauer and Keepers aren't the only ones who should have to answer for her daughter's murder.  She blames Kik, too. ""They need to shut Kik down,"" she said. ""It's just disgusting."" Kik is now a billion-dollar company and the CEO declined ""48 Hours""' request for an on-camera interview. ""It's ironic when the head of a social media company won't talk to us, so we're heading off to a technology conference in Brooklyn, New York, in hopes of catching up, with the CEO of Kik,"" said Van Sant. Evidence suggests Nicole Lovell was lured to her death over the Kik chat app – one of the same apps Elizabeth Syrotchen used to communicate with the man who almost lured her away. As Kik's CEO Ted Livingston left the stage at the conference, ""48 Hours"" found him … on his smartphone. ""Mr. Livingston, Peter Van Sant, how are you?"" Van Sant said. ""With CBS News … I just want to ask you a quick question … What personal responsibility do you have to make sure that children are safe who use the Kik app?"" ""Yeah, I think I have a huge responsibility,"" Livingston replied. ""I'm sure you're familiar with Nicole Lovell, a 13-year-old girl in Virginia,"" Van Sant continued. ""What would you say to Nicole's parents?"" ""Like, when we heard about that case, that hit the office. That hit me super hard, like, it's just, like, hard to hear about something and I grew up with a brother with disabilities..."" said Livingston. Like many social media companies, Kik posts an online guide for parents and, in a statement, told ""48 Hours"" the company cooperates with law enforcement. Ted Livingston claims his app is as safe as the competition. ""I think it's no different than Facebook or Snapchat or Instagram. You know, you have bad people going -- "" he said. ""As a parent, I disagree. I can check my child's Facebook account and Twitter account, I friend them. But with Kik I can't,"" Van Sant pointed out. ""Yeah, I think that's no different than Instagram. You have a private mode. You can have private messaging, all that exists there,"" Livingston replied. That's true, but Kik's design is attracting millions of teens, in part, because many believe its parentproof -- the best app to keep their social lives secret. Sadly, predators also can keep secrets on Kik. ""Kids are going to use a messenger. If we were to shut down Kik tomorrow, there'll be 10 right behind it,"" said Livingston. Back in Spokane, Elizabeth Syrotchen is still struggling to make sense of what happened to her.  Things with her parents are still tough … mostly because, at 18, she met a new boyfriend at the gym. He was 35. ""Would I like to see some things change?  Of course,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. ""We'd all love to see that,"" Branden Syrotchen added. ""You have to compromise. You can't just be your way or the highway,"" Elizabeth told her father on camera. Jason Richards got out of prison in May, and the case against him is closed. But in Blacksburg, Virginia, Nicole Lovell's murder case has yet to be resolved. At a joint hearing for David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers, no cameras were allowed inside as police presented new details of Nicole's murder -- details they say were provided by Keepers herself. News report: Investigators testified Eisenhauer covered Lovell's mouth and cut her throat.  Keepers later helped Eisenhauer load Lovell's body into his car, leaving a trail of blood in the snow. A detective testified that Keepers admitted to helping Eisenhauer plan the murder and then dispose of Nicole's body. And that Keepers was excited to be part of something secretive. News report: She said he was a sociopath and she was ""a sociopath in training."" It's all too much for Nicole's mom, Tammy Weeks, who comes to court, but can't force herself to sit through the day. ""I didn't know he had stripped her naked and poured bleach on her,"" she said. There is no evidence that Nicole was sexually assaulted, though Eisenhauer is formally charged with first-degree murder and abduction -- Keepers as an accessory to murder. Both also are charged with transporting or concealing a dead body. Eisenhauer has reportedly told investigators, ""I believe the truth can set me free."" ""Is there any doubt who is responsible for the death of your daughter?"" Van Sant asked David Lovell, Nicole's father. ""No,"" he declared. Eisenhauer's former internet buddy, Bryce Dustin, doesn't have much doubt either, especially after a final exchange he had with Eisenhauer around the time Nicole disappeared. ""I without a doubt believe that he did it,"" said Dustin. ""He texted me and said, you know, 'The original plan's failed.'  And he was like, he's like, 'Do you know where I can hide a body?'"" Dustin continued. At the time, Dustin thought Eisenhauer was kidding.  He, along with so many in the shell-shocked community of Blacksburg, still want to know how two intelligent college kids with their lives in front of them might wind up involved in taking the life of a 13-year-old girl. ""I wish he would've done it to me instead of her,"" Weeks cried. ""I would trade places with her in a heartbeat. 'Cause she deserved to live."" Nicole Lovell's death is a dark reminder of how social media has profoundly changed society. ""I hope … everybody learns from this.  Hold their kids tight. 'Cause it can happen to you,"" said Weeks. Today, our children have a host of new ways to live… and new ways to die as well. David Eisenhauer is scheduled to be tried in November 2017.  Natalie Keepers is scheduled to be tried in February 2018 . If convicted, both could face life in prison with no parole.

By TIM ALBERTA and RACHAEL BADE December 14, 2017 Tim Alberta is national political reporter at Politico Magazine. Rachael Bade is a congressional reporter for Politico. Spirits were high inside the House chamber on Thursday, November 16, when, in the early afternoon, the gavel fell and a measure to rewrite the American tax code passed on a partisan tally of 227 to 205. As the deciding votes were castârecorded in green on the black digital scoreboard suspended above the floorâthe speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, threw his head back and slammed his hands together. Soon he was engulfed in a sea of dark suits, every Republican lawmaker wanting to slap him on the shoulder and be a part of his moment. Ryan was the man of the hour. Having spent a quarter-century in Washingtonâas an intern, waiter, junior think-tanker, Hill staffer and, since 1999, as a member of Congressâhe had never wavered in his obsession with fixing what he viewed as the nationâs two fundamental weaknesses: its Byzantine tax system and ballooning entitlement state. Now, with House Republicans celebrating the once-in-a-generation achievement of a tax overhaul, Ryan was feeling both jubilant and relievedâand a little bit greedy. Reveling in the afterglow, Ryan remarked to several colleagues how this day had proven they could accomplish difficult thingsâand that next year, they should set their sights on an even tougher challenge: entitlement reform. The speaker has since gone public with this aspiration, suggesting that 2018 should be the year Washington finally tackles what he sees as the systemic problems with Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Tinkering with the social safety net is a bold undertaking, particularly in an election year. But Ryan has good reason for throwing caution to the wind: His time in Congress is running short. Despite several landmark legislative wins this year, and a better-than-expected relationship with President Donald Trump, Ryan has made it known to some of his closest confidants that this will be his final term as speaker. He consults a small crew of family, friends and staff for career advice, and is always cautious not to telegraph his political maneuvers. But the expectation of his impending departure has escaped the hushed confines of Ryanâs inner circle and permeated the upper-most echelons of the GOP. In recent interviews with three dozen people who know the speakerâfellow lawmakers, congressional and administration aides, conservative intellectuals and Republican lobbyistsânot a single person believed Ryan will stay in Congress past 2018. Ryan was tiring of D.C. even before reluctantly accepting the speakership. He told his predecessor, John Boehner, that it would be his last job in politicsâand that it wasnât a long-term proposition. In the months following Trumpâs victory, he began contemplating the scenarios of his departure. More recently, over closely held conversations with his kitchen cabinet, Ryanâs preference has become clear: He would like to serve through Election Day 2018 and retire ahead of the next Congress. This would give Ryan a final legislative year to chase his second white whale, entitlement reform, while using his unrivaled fundraising prowess to help protect the House majorityâall with the benefit of averting an ugly internecine power struggle during election season. Ryan has never loved the job; he oozes aggravation when discussing intraparty debates over âmicro-tactics,"" and friends say he feels like heâs running a daycare center. On a personal level, going home at the end of next year would allow Ryan, who turns 48 next month, to keep promises to family; his three children are in or entering their teenage years, and Ryan, whose father died at 55, wants desperately to live at home with them full time before they begin flying the nest. The best part of this scenario, people close to the speaker emphasize: He wouldnât have to share the ballot with Trump again in 2020. And yet speculation is building that, Ryan, even fresh off his tax-reform triumph, might not be able to leave on his own terms. He now faces a massive pileup of cannot-fail bills in January and February. Itâs an outrageous legislative lift: Congress must, in the coming weeks, fund the government, raise the debt ceiling, modify spending caps, address the continuation of health care subsidies, shell out additional funds for disaster relief and deal with the millions of undocumented young immigrants whose protected status has been thrown into limbo. It represents the most menacing stretch of Ryanâs speakershipâone that will almost certainly require him to break promises made to his conference and give significant concessions to Democrats in exchange for their votes. To meet key deadlines, heâll have to approve sizable spending increases and legal status for minors who came to the U.S. illegallyâtwo things that could raise the ire of the GOP base and embolden his conservative rivals on Capitol Hill. There is no great outcome available, Ryan has conceded to some trusted associatesâonly survival. âWin the day. Win the next day. And then win the week,â Ryan has been preaching to his leadership team. The speaker can't afford to admit heâs a lame duckâhis fundraising capacity and deal-making leverage would be vastly diminished, making the House all the more difficult to govern. When asked at the end of a Thursday morning press conference if he was leaving soon, Ryan shot a quick ânoâ over his shoulder as he walked out of the room. Clockwise, from upper left: Paul Ryan with President Donald Trump after a November meeting of the House Republican Conference; outgoing House Speaker John Boehner hands the gavel off to Ryan in Oct. 2015; Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the halls of the Capitol en route to a Nov. 2015 GOP policy luncheon; Rep. Mark Meadows, head of the House Freedom Caucus, fields reporters' questions in April. | Getty Images Ryan is backed by the vast majority of the GOP Conference, but even a small group of dissenters can make the speakerâs life miserableâand he knows it. When Ryan succeeded Boehner in the fall of 2015, the new speaker sought to eliminateâor at least weakenâthe parliamentary tactic that had been used against his predecessor. By filing a âmotion to vacate the chair,â Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina had found a way to force a vote on the speakership at any timeâa potential humiliation that Boehner avoided by retiring. Ryan, working with Boehnerâs team during the transition, was unsuccessful in banning this practice. But he made it clear to Boehner at the time, and to his own allies upon assuming the speakership, that he would not serve at the whims of Meadows and the House Freedom Caucus, a group of some 35 conservative hard-liners. In an interview this fall with POLITICO Magazine, Ryan said the motion to vacate doesnât loom large as a constant threat to his job security. âNo, because itâs not a job I ever wanted in the first place,â Ryan said. âIf I was dying to be speaker, I guess it probably would be a dagger over my head. But I donât think like that.â Members of the Freedom Caucus donât necessarily believe this rhetoric from Ryan, but they respect the strategic advantage it gives him. After all, when Boehner left town, Ryan was the only consensus replacementâand even then, members had to beg him to assume the most powerful office on Capitol Hill. Given that history, any conservative who attempts to overthrow Ryan would make the Freedom Caucusâand its two leaders, Meadows and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordanâlook like nihilists who collect speakersâ scalps for sport. This is especially true without any obvious, universally acceptable successor waiting in the wings. âThere are no more golden boys left,â Meadows said in an interview, discussing the possibility of Ryanâs departure. Ryanâs problems are not limited to the Freedom Caucus; there is, without question, wider discontent in the conference than the speaker appreciates, with legislators across the ideological and experiential spectrums grumbling about a hypercentralized process that gives them a vote on the floor but little else. That said, it requires a special brand of gumption to go after the speakerâs gavelâand the usual suspects can be found in and on the periphery of the Freedom Caucus. These members, who have been eerily quiet for much of 2017, have begun making noise about a mutiny. The expectation of a major betrayal on Ryanâs partâeither on spending levels, immigration or a combination of the twoâhas prompted incessant chatter in recent weeks of someone filing a motion to vacate the chair, perhaps as soon as next month. This could be gamesmanship, a bluff to make Ryan feel pressured to step aside. But with a sudden, pervasive sense that Ryan might be ready to leave anyway, a motion to vacate would make sense as a test of his desire to stay on the job. Either way, the convergence of these realizationsâRyan wanting to retire after 2018, and a possible threat to his speakership even soonerâhas sparked a flurry of activity in the offices of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise, the two most likely successors to Ryan. Both believed Ryan would leave late next year and were therefore planning their next steps at an appropriately deliberate pace. This has abruptly changed: According to multiple GOP sources, both McCarthy and Scalise have taken recent meetings with members loyal to them who have been eager to strategize about life after Ryan. There is little chance Scalise runs against McCarthy, but the whipâknowing McCarthy lacked the votes to become speaker in 2015, prompting Ryan to accept the jobâis taking careful stock of the conference, preparing to launch his own candidacy should McCarthy stumble a second time. Left: Kevin McCarthy takes questions from the press in the U.S. Capitol, Oct. 2015. Right: Steve Scalise at the National Christmas Tree Lighting, Nov. 2017. | Getty Images The one person who can keep these dominoes from falling, at least in the near term, is Trump. The president and the speaker have been a better pairing than anyone could have imagined a year ago, considering Ryan abandoned the GOP nominee during the homestretch of the 2016 campaign. The speaker has kept shoulder to shoulder with the White House at moments of vulnerability, knowing Trump can shield himâand his membersâfrom the fury of the right. If the president endorses whatever grotesque legislative meatball comes out of the House in the coming weeksâpublicly and unambiguouslyâitâs impossible to see Ryan facing any real threat. If the president distances himself from the speaker, however, the floodgates could openâand quickly. Conservatives, having whispered in the presidentâs ear about Ryan not sharing his interests, will be watching carefully for cues. So too will Steve Bannon, who has been conspicuous this year in holding his fire on Ryan, an old nemesis, while laying waste to Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell. Bannon and Meadows, a pair of disruptive forces, have spent the past year keeping Ryanâs blood out of the waterâbut in the unlikely scenario that Trump suddenly sours on the House speaker, they will be inviting the sharks to dinner. Underscoring all of this palace intrigue are some strange realitiesâsuch as the fact that Ryanâs survival as speaker might require cover from the very president who once believed that Ryan was trying to sabotage his presidential campaign. Or the notion that Ryan, should he secure his final year in office, will use it to pursue the type of dramatic, politically risky entitlement reforms that Trump explicitly ruled out while running for president. Perhaps no piece of irony is more striking, or effective in capturing this volatile period of Republican history, than the juxtaposition between Ryan celebrating his dream of rewriting the tax codeâwhile hearing of renewed threats to his speakership. *** Ryan nearly walked away from Congress once before. It was November 2012, after Mitt Romneyâs loss to Barack Obama, and the would-be vice president found himself despondent and homesick. Ryan told his wife, Janna, that he was considering retirement. Thatâs when Boehner called. The speaker, concerned about the stability of his conference, could not afford to lose Ryan; he promised the influential Budget Committee chairman a waiver so he could lead the panel for another two years. Ryan agreed, and as the sting of 2012 receded, he began to map out his political futureâand his exit strategy from Congress. Having run and lost a national campaign, Ryan rejected pleas to consider his own presidential prospects; instead, he set his sights on the Ways and Means Committee. The chairmanship, which he had long viewed as a dream job, would open after 2014, and Ryan saw it as the perfect perch from which to both pursue his long-standing policy goals and influence the direction of the national party in 2016. Ryan had it all figured out, according to interviews at the time with his friends, family and staff: He would chair the committee, help a newly elected Republican president write a sweeping overhaul of the tax code, and then ride off into the sunset. But it wasnât meant to be. Less than a year into Ryanâs Ways and Means tenure, Boehner decided to call it quits. He had asked his protege several times over the previous yearâsince the primary defeat of Majority Leader Eric Cantorâto succeed him as the speaker. âI gave him the Heisman every time,â Ryan told POLITICO. The Ways and Means chairman was content to support his friend McCarthy. But the Freedom Caucus wasnât. Jordan and Meadows, concerned that McCarthy, a pragmatic Californian, would lead no differently than Boehner, made him a series of offersâtheir support in exchange for something from him. One of the proposals called for process reforms, including a drastic restructuring of the Steering Committee, which decides committee assignments and chairmanships. Another, more politically explicit offer, promised McCarthy the groupâs votes if he could make either Jordan or Meadows the majority leader. When McCarthy bristled, suggesting he couldnât possibly deliver what they wanted, the group told him he wouldnât have enough votes on the House floor to become speakerâeven if he had already scored an overwhelming majority in the closed-door conference election.

Hours before that private vote was set to occur, McCarthy called Ryan to say he didnât want the jobâand that really, Ryan should take it. He still wasnât interested. Only after several days of around-the-clock phone calls from prominent Republicans did Ryan open himself to the possibility. He began thinking about his conditions for accepting the job. One was family time on the weekends, which was non-negotiable; another was support from the Freedom Caucus. Ryan had watched Boehner struggle to contain the rebellion after the tea party wave of 2010; he would not assume the speakership over the objections of the same rambunctious members who had helped drive Boehner from office. By securing their support up front, Ryan hoped to inoculate himself against the inevitable future grumblings from House conservatives. Some Freedom Caucus members had reservations about Ryan, but others were ecstatic at his willingness to take the job. Unlike with Boehner, they saw the Wisconsiniteâan Ayn Rand devotee and fierce critic of the welfare stateâas one of their own. He was equally appealing to other factions of the conferenceâa sober-minded, well-spoken, telegenic leader with policy experience and people skills. After five years of civil war, there was no other figure who could unite the fractured House Republican Conference. Ryanâs colleagues teasingly called him âThe Chosen One,â and in late October 2015, he assumed the speakership. The cease-fire was short lived. Conservatives say Ryan failed a critical first test just weeks after taking the gavel, when he refused to leverage government funding to impose new restrictions on the nationâs refugee settlement program in the wake of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. Jordan pleaded with the new speaker to hold out for increased vetting, telling him that it would show Obama and Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid that âthereâs a new sheriff in town.â Ryan refusedâan original sin that chafes Jordan to this day. As he struggled to adjust to his complex new roleââlike Einstein learning to write poetry,â is how one of Ryanâs admirers described itâhe committed another strategic error that would prove costly with some of his members: dismissing the reality TV star running for his partyâs nomination. In private conversations, Ryan called Trump âa jokeâ whose penchant for identity politics was dividing the country and dooming the Republican Partyâs future. He wasnât much gentler in public: For most of the campaign, Ryan made it seem he felt honor-bound to denounce the candidateâs latest incendiary remark or antic, as though the two were personally engaged in a tug-of-war for the GOPâs soul. This annoyed some of Ryanâs membersâboth pro-Trumpers and others who disliked him but respected the anger he was tapping into. When the speaker initially withheld his support after Trump became the presumptive nomineeâthen continued to poke at him even after issuing a grudging endorsementâsome of Ryanâs colleagues wondered if he was attempting to sabotage the GOP ticket. Ryan made a point, for instance, never to be photographed with Trumpâfearful of how it would be used to tarnish his brand, according to multiple sources. But the speaker came to agree that the icy relationship between them was unhelpful to the national party. Under mounting pressure from his members, as well as his longtime friend, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, Ryan offered an olive branch, inviting the GOP nominee to his district for a Saturday afternoon campaign rally. All hell broke loose on the evening before the event, when the Washington Post published a decade-old recording of Trump boasting about his sexual exploitsâand his ability to grope women because of his celebrity status. It seemed to be the nail in his campaignâs coffin. Ryan immediately disinvited Trump from Elkhorn, railing to Priebus and other GOP officials about the man he had never trusted or respected in the first place. Feeling validated, and certain that his members were equally outraged, Ryan wanted to take decisive actionâeven entertaining the idea of withdrawing his endorsement of Trump. On an emergency leadership conference call the weekend of the âAccess Hollywoodâ tape, Ryan floated this idea as House GOP leaders debated how far to distance themselves from Trump. He would cripple their majority, the speaker said; cutting him off might be their best hope of saving the House. It was ultimately McCarthyâwho has become Trumpâs favored member of the GOP leadershipâwho talked Ryan down. Withdrawing their support, he said, according to multiple sources familiar with the call, might backfire by hurting their own members. He suggested they cool off and not act on impulse. Ryan agreed, yet somehow still crossed the line with many House Republicans when he declaredâon another conference call the following Monday morning, this time with all Republican membersâthat he would no longer defend or campaign for Trump. That call, leaked to reporters in real time, lit a fire in the grass roots. Congressional phone lines exploded thereafter, with irate GOP constituents calling for Ryanâs head. Some members began questioning the sustainability of his speakership; in late October 2016, after leaders scheduled Ryanâs speakership nomination, a number of pro-Trump House members urged Ryan to postpone it so they had more time to consider if he should lead the conference. One of those was Rep. Jim Renacci, an establishment-friendly Republican who had long served with Ryan on the Ways and Means Committee. The Ohio Republican started garnering signatures on a secret letter arguing that âthe conference is dividedâ and âthere is no reason to hastily hold elections.â Freedom Caucus members sensed an opportunity. At a secret meeting at Meadowsâ downtown D.C. apartment, days before the election, Freedom Caucus board members devised a plan to deny Ryan the 218 votes needed to retain his speakership. The strategy called for Jordan to serve as the âsacrificial lamb,â running against Ryanânot to win, but to keep the speaker from having the votes needed for reelection. The idea was that Ryan, who talked frequently (and annoyingly, to some members) about how he had never wanted the job in the first place, would step aside to avoid the spectacle. Conservatives had already begun searching for a new speaker from outside their narrow ranksâsomeone who would command the respect of the conference. Rep. Mike Pompeoâthen a little-known, dry-witted defense hawk whoâd later make friends in high places and become Trumpâs CIA directorâbecame their top choice. As Republicans schemed against their speaker, the underlying assumption was that Trump would lose and the conservative base would be out for bloodâthat, or Trump would win and kick Ryan to the curb. Either way, he would be finished. *** Less than an hour before the polls closed on November 8, 2016, Ryan made the phone call heâd been dreading. With a handful of staffers and family members lingering nearby, Ryan was patched through to senior officials at the RNC in Washington. They had been analyzing voting patterns and running turnout models throughout the day, and were prepared to share their projections with the speaker: Trump was going to go down in flames, earning just 220 electoral votes. Republicans would lose nearly 20 House seats. Democrats would retake control of the United States Senate. Exactly the debacle Ryan had feared. Stewing inside his teamâs war room at the Holiday Inn in Janesvilleâthe site of his own election night partyâRyan could not stomach the thought of working with President Hillary Clinton. That said, he wasnât exactly thrilled about working with Trump, whose campaignâfueled by anger, resentment and nativismâwas, in his view, a rejection of conservatismâs highest ideals. As disappointed as he was about Clintonâs apparent victory, the speaker saw a silver lining: He would seize the occasion of Trumpâs defeatâbeginning that nightâto speak about a return to an inclusive, aspirational, Jack Kemp-inspired âhappy warriorâ conservatism, and a rejection of Trumpism. But Ryan never got the chance. His own race had been called early, and attendees waited patiently in the ballroom for his victory speech. But the speaker was paralyzed in the war room, watching in disbelief as Trump surged past Clinton in the pivotal battlegrounds of Florida and North Carolina. The RNCâs numbers, his advisers told him, were garbage: The GOPâs Senate majority appeared safe, only a handful of House Republicans were losing, and if the current trends held, Trump was going to win the biggest upset in presidential history. Just before 10 p.m. Eastern, Ryan finally took the stage and spoke for three minutes. âIâve just been sitting there watching the polls,â Ryan said, the shock written all over his face. âBy some accounts, this could be a really good night for America. This could be a good night for us. Fingers crossed.â Ryan would seize the occasion of Trumpâs defeat to speak about a return to an inclusive, aspirational, Jack Kemp-inspired âhappy warriorâ conservatism, and a rejection of Trumpism. He never got the chance. Ryan faced a legacy-shaping decision that night: Stay true to himself and step down as speaker, or muzzle himself and serve alongside Trump in a unified GOP government. It was a no-brainer: This was Ryanâs chance to actually achieve the things he had only fantasized about. Even if that meant getting in bed with the likes of Trump and Bannon. And even if that meant accommodating behavior from a Republican president that he would never tolerate from a Democrat. It was a trade-off Ryan could not refuse. It was, in the refrain of the speakerâs allies, âPaulâs deal with the devil,â one that he would make all over again. Chasing his legislative dreams would require keeping his criticisms of Trump to himself. âYou canât create a sideshow, even if thereâs cause for a sideshow, because itâs going to get in the way of getting the big things done,â Boehner told POLITICO Magazine of Ryanâs approach to Trump. âPaul has got his head on straight. Heâs very comfortable with who he is and what heâs got to do.â As some conservatives watched eagerly for a smoke signal from the president-electâhoping he would remember the speakerâs disloyalty and recommend a replacementâRyan moved quickly to secure his standing. He spoke with both Trump and his longtime friend, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, in the hours before Trumpâs victory speech, and made swift plans Wednesday morning to meet with them in Washington the next day. Before their meeting, Ryan shared with several friends that he planned to start his talk with Trump by mentioning their bad blood during the campaign, and explaining why he had said and done certain things. They cut him off: That was a terrible idea. Donât remind Trump of how much he despised you in the past, they said. Focus on the future. Ryan listened. And the advice was sound: To this day, despite Trumpâs famously long memory, sources in both camps say the president and speaker have never once revisited their old feud. Indeed, a surprising subplot of the unified GOP governmentâs first year has been the unlikely alliance between Trump and Ryan. The healing process that began in D.C. two days after the election culminated in Pence delivering the message to House Republicans, just minutes before the speakership election, that Trump supported Ryan. (Only one Republican, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, voted against him.) The relationship since has been strangely drama free: Trump and Ryan talk often throughout the week, chewing on questions of policy and process and politics. Never once has there been a blowup, either in person or over the phone. Sources close to both men say they occasionally vent about the otherâTrump telling aides that the speaker canât count votes; Ryan complaining to leadership comrades about the president saying things unbecoming of his officeâand yet these feuds are, somewhat miraculously, kept in the family. President Trump and Speaker Ryan during a June 2017 meeting with House and Senate leadership in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. | Getty Images Ryanâs allies paint this as part of a broader pictureâhis stronger-than-expected partnership with the president; his landmark victories in passing tax reform, as well as a repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, on the House floor; his prolific, historic fundraising on behalf of the embattled GOP majorityâto argue that his Faustian bargain has proven worthwhile. And they cite these same examples to dismiss the sanity of threats against his speakership: What more could House Republicans possibly want from him? âPaul Ryan is by far and away the best possible person we have to lead this group of people in the right direction,â said one such ally, Rep. Tom Rooney of Florida. âI just think that any talk of him leaving, I hope thatâs not true. It would be a major setback for our cause.â Every speaker deals with varying degrees of discontent in their conference. In Ryanâs case, it owes less to ideology than process. Specifically, members who felt marginalized under Boehnerâwho ran a top-down operation that cut out committee chairs and left little room for lawmakers to shape legislationâfeel the House is even more centralized under Ryan. This was evident in the speakerâs first, botched attempt at repealing Obamacare: He wrote the bill on his own, then framed it as a âbinary choiceâ for members to either back his proposal or be viewed as supporters of Obamacare. The stunt rubbed Ryanâs colleagues the wrong way, particularly Freedom Caucus members who had extracted promises from him in 2015 about opening up the House and restoring regular order. Conservatives arenât the only ones annoyed with Ryanâs approach, and it isnât just back-bench members voicing displeasure. Sources close to House Budget Chairwoman Diane Black, a longtime Ryan ally, said she was deeply upset over the summer about Ryanâs treatment of her budget processâthough she, like many other senior members friendly with the speaker, would never voice these criticisms publicly. Ryan trampled on Blackâs budget in order to expedite the push for tax reform. But when the time came to draft the legislation, members of the Ways and Means Committeeâwho had worked alongside Ryan for yearsâgrew upset at what they saw as the speakerâs dictatorial approach. Tax writers vented to the White House that he wielded an iron grip on the process and that they had little imprint on the final product; members grumbled about Ryan big-footing Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady. Members of his committee said they didnât see the final bill until just days before they voted on it. Itâs no coincidence that more than half a dozen members on Ways and Meansâone of the most powerful and desired positions in Congressâare walking away from the House in 2018. Renacci, in an interview, specifically cited Ryanâs top-down style as a reason he was leaving the House to run for governor of Ohio. âYouâve got to be willing to let everyone bring one pebble of sand to the beach, so they at least feel they helped build the beach,â Renacci said. âAnd thatâs regular order. If you donât get that, youâre never going to be a leader here in the conference.â Similar complaints dogged the previous speaker. But unlike Boehner, who bunkered down and lost touch with many of his newer members, Ryan has made a sustained effort to engage the full spectrum of his colleagues on a regular basis, with both group and individual meetings. This has given rank-and-file lawmakers greater access to the speakerâthough not a greater role in the legislative process. Heâs more controlling than Boehner â¦ and I voted against John Boehner and worked with Mark Meadows to vacate the chair,â said Rep. Walter Jones. âIâve been here 22 years and this is the most closed shop Iâve ever seen.â At the end of the day, the real threat to Ryan exists in the same place it did during Boehnerâs speakership: on the right flank of the conference. Early this fall, as the tax-reform battle was heating up, Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolinaâa constant thorn in Boehnerâs sideâjoked to fellow conservatives that he wanted to issue a formal apology to the former speaker. Having experienced Ryanâs tight grip on the House, Jones said, he now viewed Boehner as a legendâ a remark that elicited laughs but also murmurs of agreement in the room. Since then, the idea of conservatives writing an apology letter to Boehner has became a running joke on the right. âHeâs more controlling than Boehner â¦ and I voted against John Boehner and worked with Mark Meadows to vacate the chair,â Jones said. âIâm very dissatisfied. Iâve been here 22 years and this is the most closed shop Iâve ever seen.â Even so, there is no comparing the two speakers at this point. Whereas Boehner had lost all goodwill with conservatives by the time of his exit, Ryan today has strong allies on the rightâeven if there are an equal number of detractors. âI think Ryan has done a good job,â said Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker. âHe to this day has my full, 100 percent support. â¦ He has to herd all these different factions and people on a daily basis, and I respect that.â *** Ryan and his team have operated under the assumption that if Republicans enact the first tax overhaul in 30 years, much of the frustration will wane â and partywide euphoria at the realization of their first major legislative victory will make the year-end, bipartisan deals easier to swallow. But rank-and-file members arenât so sure. And they worry that Ryanâs tunnel vision on tax reform has weakened the GOPâs negotiating hand against the Democrats. During a recent meeting with elders of the RSC, Rep. Tom Graves, a senior member on the Appropriations Committee, argued that a âmystic, hypnotic fog of tax reformâ had crippled the conference over the past two months, âparalyzingâ Republicans from creating an effective spending strategy to advance other Trump priorities. That concern has echoed throughout the conference in recent weeks. Many House Republicans fear they will be forced to back a massive spending package that drives up the deficitâand an immigration compromise antithetical to the beliefs of the party base. During a meeting in Ryanâs office in early November, Rep. Warren Davidson, the Ohio Republican who replaced Boehner and promptly joined the Freedom Caucus, held up the speakerâs âBetter Wayâ pamphlet from 2016 and told him: âThere is no âDACA amnesty playâ in the playbook.â Hoping to assuage these concerns, Ryan last week summoned representatives from the conferenceâs various factions to meet and come up with a unifying plan ahead of the December 22 deadline to fund the government. The resulting strategy, one that Ryan pledged to execute, has House Republicans sending a funding bill to the Senate next week that includes GOP priorities, such as increased Pentagon funding, but nothing for Democratsâand then leaving town and daring Senate Democrats to vote no. (Itâs a difficult promise to keep, since McConnell needs at least eight Democratic votes to approve any dealânot to mention that the Senate is accustomed to jamming the House, not the other way around.) Ryan can see the storm clouds gathering. But people close to him insist he would never quit mid-Congress, even if passing tax reform into law provides the perfect opportunity to walk awayâand even if recent accounts of sexual misconduct among House members have made the job even more stressful. (Two friends say Ryan was visibly shaken after demanding that Arizona Rep. Trent Franks resign his seat, telling them, âI didnât realize slitting throats was part of my job.â) Two friends say Ryan was visibly shaken after demanding that Arizona Rep. Trent Franks resign his seat, telling them, âI didnât realize slitting throats was part of my job.â Even though few members believe Ryanâs job is truly in jeopardy, the whispers of his not-far-off retirement have sent various constituencies scrambling to prepare for a shake up. Members loyal to Scalise have urged him to have a candid discussion with McCarthy about his inability to unify the conference, while McCarthyâs allies have urged him to line up the presidentâs support so itâs ready at a momentâs notice. Some neutral parties think Scalise has the inside trackâthat Trumpâs backing wonât be enough to put him over the top, and that Scaliseâs already-high stock has skyrocketed since he survived an assassination attempt in June. But the Freedom Caucus will be focused less on personalities than process: As in 2015, conservative members are drafting various demands in exchange for the next speaker to win their votes. This will cause eyes to roll in some quarters of the conference. But the reality is that while Ryan would surely win a hypothetical near-term battle over his speakership, the Freedom Caucus is already winning the war. This is simple math: Because of its size and willingness to vote as a bloc, the Freedom Caucus will almost certainly provide the margin to crown the next speaker. And assuming Republicans lose seats next yearâwith swing-district moderates the first to fallâthe conservatives will have even more leverage over GOP leadership in the coming Congress. In a period of particular tension a few months back, one conservative member presented Meadows with a fake draft of a motion to vacate the chair. It was meant to make light of what conservatives viewed as their sorry situation in that moment: nine months into a unified Republican government, and still without a single legislative victory. Meadows told the member the prank was ânot funny.â But to some members, the prospect of taking out Ryan clearly isnât a joke. It only takes one of them, eager to antagonize the leadership and win lots of headlines, to file the motion and plunge the House into temporary chaos. The question at that point becomes how hard Ryan is willing to fight to retain his speakershipâand how forcefully other Republicans come to his defense. When Meadows made his attempt on Boehner, dozens of allies rushed to the former speakerâs office to strategize, demanding an immediate vote to show their strength. Ryan, who keeps a small circle of close friends, does not have any comparable apparatus of longtime loyalists determined to protect himânor does he view his legacy in Congress as inextricably tied to the position of speaker of the House. âYouâve got to remember, Iâm the only guy in the modern era who didnât want this job,â Ryan told POLITICO Magazine this fall. âI did this because I had to do it. And Iâm happy and Iâm grateful for the job and itâs a great honor. And I feel like I was made for this moment. So Iâm good with it. But Iâm not a person who covets it. And I never was. So I always feel liberated by that.â Whenever Ryan exits, familiar questions will resurface about whether the Republican Party is governableâand whether, in Congress, there will ever be a leader capable of uniting its tribes. Congress runs on relationships: Boehner was personally popular among members, even those who voted against his initiatives, and the same can largely be said for Ryan. But this is no longer seems sufficient. Dissension in the House Republican ranks is explained not by incompatible personalities, but rather by a fundamental disconnect between the leadership and the rank and file over questions of legislative involvement and procedural transparency. Whoever wishes to succeed Ryan would do well to realize it. During a conference meeting last week, Raúl Labrador of Idaho, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, ripped into the leadership. âItâs not that we donât like you,â he said to McCarthy, who stood at the podium. âItâs that we donât trust you.â California By Jeremy B.

American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), a major gun manufacturer which owns the Smith & Wesson brand, reported a 90% drop in quarterly profit when compared to the same period last year. Profits went from $32 million last year to $3.2 million. The company also reported a 36% drop in sales year-to-year. ""Total revenue for the quarter faced a challenging comparison to last year, when we believe strong consumer demand was driven by personal safety concerns and pre-election fears of increased firearm legislation,"" said CEO James Debney, in a statement. Last year marked a record year for gun sales. The surge was driven by fears that then-President Obama and candidate Hillary Clinton would implement gun controls amid a series of deadly mass shootings. Sales dropped industry-wide after the unexpected victory of Donald Trump, a Republican endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Related: Vista Outdoor's gun and ammo sales tank under Trump American Outdoor Brands has seen a 30% decline in its stock in 2017. ""The firearms industry is still suffering from continued malaise in retail sell-through due to the Trump slump,"" said Rommel Dionisio, a gun industry analyst for Aegis Capital Corp. He said manufacturers and retailers are still dealing with an inventory backlog, because they stocked up prior to the election expecting stronger sales. The stock price for American Outdoor Brands did rise 5% on Thursday after the House passed the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act earlier this week. That act, if it passes the Senate, would create a nationwide system for concealed carry permits. Dionisio said that might eventually help the industry recover. But stocks plummeted over night after American Outdoor Brands reported its dismal earnings. Debney said that among the few bright spots for the company were the relatively strong sales of compact M&P brand handguns designed for concealed carry. The M&P line of guns also includes AR-15-style rifles. Related: Black Friday was huge for gun sales The company's quarter ended on October 31. This report includes a month of gun sales activity after the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest in U.S. history. But it does not include figures for November, which saw a month-to-month uptick for background checks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which serve as a proxy for gun sales.

          / CBS News COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- As the fifth anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, approaches, Americans remain starkly divided in their views on guns and gun regulation. The attack, which left 20 children and six educators dead, as well as the gunman and his mother, shook the country, leading to widespread calls for reformed gun laws. Half a decade later, proponents and opponents of gun control are still fiercely debating. In the lead-up to the fifth anniversary of the attack, CBS News producer Christina Ruffini facilitated a series of conversations with residents of Colorado, a state where gun issues have remained divisive, even after two infamous mass shootings of its own in Aurora and Columbine. In one conversation, Ruffini spoke with Tony, who adamantly supports the right to own a gun, and his friend Warren, who adamantly believes in regulating firearms. She asked Tony if his belief in gun rights would waver in a hypothetical scenario involving empirical evidence ""that if we make everyone in the country turn in their assault rifle we will cut shooting deaths in this country by a significant amount."" ""I would not,"" Tony said, adding that he believes armed civilians deter potential foreign invaders. ""You'd really be giving a lot of our neighbors far more reason to think the United States is weak. We have never been invaded, not only because of our geographical situation, but also because ..."" ""So you think 'Red Dawn' is gonna happen?"" Warren interjected, referring to a 1984 film depicting a Soviet invasion. ""No, I don't think it's gonna happen,"" Tony responded. ""I think it won't happen because we're armed."" Ruffini then offered a similar scenario to the anti-gun Warren, asking if he would buy an assault rifle in a hypothetical scenario in which ""we have statistically proven that you and your family will be safer if you own"" one. ""I really don't know because I want to keep my family safe, but to what lengths am I willing to go? I don't know until we're in that situation...until I was living in a place that was so dangerous, that that was the only way to keep people safe,"" Warren said. ""I think that's a different world than I live in right now."" When it comes to assault weapons, Americans are largely split along the same lines as Tony and Warren. A CBS News poll released Monday found while there is strong bipartisan support for background checks for all gun buyers, Americans are torn on whether gun violence represents a crisis -- Democrats are three times as likely as Republicans to see it that way -- and near evenly divided on whether to ban assault weapons. The poll, which was conducted by telephone between Dec. 3 and Dec. 5 among a random sample of 1,120 adults nationwide, found 49 percent favor a ban, while 48 percent oppose. Watch this conversation and other pointed debates about firearms on the CBSN special ""Mass Shootings: Five Years After Sandy Hook,"" which will air Thursday at 8 p.m. ET.

Developing now, Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2017: THE LEAD STORY: Revelations about anti-Trump views of an FBI agent who played a key role in Michael Flynn's questioning and in the Hillary Clinton email probe has cast doubt on the credibility of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe and the integrity of agency ... Peter Strzok, who was removed from Mueller’s investigation because he sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague, oversaw the FBI’s interviews with ousted National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Fox News confirmed. Strzok, a former deputy to the assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, also changed former FBI Director James Comey’s early draft language about Hillary Clinton’s actions regarding her private email server from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless,” Fox News confirmed. The language being edited was important because classified material that’s been mishandled for “gross negligence” calls for criminal consequences, analysts point out. Strzok is under review by the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General for the role he played in the Clinton email investigation. The reports about Strzok prompted President Trump to suggest over the weekend that the handling and closure of the Clinton email probe without criminal charges allegedly was driven by partisan politics. MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR CONYERS?: Another woman has accused embattled Rep. John Conyers of sexual misconduct as he is expected to make an announcement about his political future today ... Elisa Grubbs, who says she worked for Conyers for more than a decade, reportedly said in an affidavit that he slid his hand up her skirt and rubbed her thighs while she was sitting next to him in the front row of a church. Grubbs is the cousin of another accuser, Marion Brown, who reached a confidential settlement with Conyers over sexual harassment allegations. The new allegations emerged as Conyers, 88, is expected to speak on a Detroit radio show today about his political future, according to his attorney, Arnold Reed. Conyers is the longest-serving current House member and has already stepped aside from his position as ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. MOORE BACKING: The Republican National Committee is once again supporting embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore after President Trump formally endorsed him, a senior RNC official told Fox News ...  Despite losing the backing of many top Republicans, Moore was praised by Trump who said that Republicans would need his vote ""on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more."" The RNC's reversal comes three weeks after it announced it had severed its fundraising ties to Moore following allegations that he'd molested two teenagers when he was in his 30s. GAY RIGHTS VERSUS RELIGION IN HIGH COURT: The encounter between a same-sex couple and a Colorado baker lasted just a few seconds -- but the legal, political and social impact could extend for decades after the Supreme Court takes up their case today ... The justices will hear oral arguments in perhaps the most closely watched appeal so far this term, pitting religious conviction against anti-discrimination laws.  At issue is a July 2012 encounter, when Charlie Craig and David Mullins of Denver visited Masterpiece Cakeshop to buy a custom-made wedding cake. Owner Jack Phillips refused his services when told it was for a same-sex couple. A state civil rights commission sanctioned Phillips after a formal complaint from the gay couple. ANOTHER STEP CLOSER TO TAX REFORM: The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives has voted to go to conference on tax legislation with the Senate, moving Congress another step closer to a final bill ... The House voted 222-192 to go to conference with the Senate, setting up formal negotiations on the legislation that could take weeks to complete. Seven Republicans voted ""no."" The Republican-led Senate was expected to hold a similar conference vote later this week.

Trans activists became more prominent this year, because (or despite the fact that) Trump announced a ban – not yet enacted – on transgender individuals serving in the military. The context of that decision might surprise you – compared with the general population, transgender people in America are 2.3 times more likely to serve in the military. And they’re 8.7 times more likely to have attempted suicide at some point in their lives. Read more here.

By JOHN BRESNAHAN 12/03/2017 04:03 PM EST Updated 12/03/2017 11:00 PM EST Speaker Paul Ryan is short of the GOP votes he needs to pass a continuing resolution, though top Republicans believe they will get there by week's end. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Congress faces another frantic week as GOP leaders and President Donald Trump wrestle with a possible government shutdown; immigration, tax and gun policies; multiple allegations of sexual harassment against lawmakers; and the probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. Funding for federal agencies is set to run out on Friday, but lawmakers don't really think there will be a shutdown — at least not yet. Still, a pile-up of contentious policy fights coupled with frequent distractions as Trump's frustration grows with the Russia investigation has many Republicans anxious about the next few weeks. House GOP leaders have proposed a two-week “continuing resolution” to keep the government open until Dec. 22, arguing they need the funding extension to make progress in bipartisan talks to boost both defense and non-defense spending. They expect they’ll need a second two-week funding bill in late December to get past the holidays, though the odds of a shutdown would drastically increase during that time if a budget deal isn’t close. Right now, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is short of the GOP votes he needs to pass a CR, though top Republicans believe they will get there by week's end. But Senate Democrats, who can block any funding bill, could be key to keeping the government open. Both House and Senate Democrats are demanding that Trump, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reach an agreement to protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented people known as Dreamers who will lose work permits and deportation protections starting early next year unless an Obama-era program that gave them some security is revived in some form. So far, Trump and Republican leaders don’t want to tie a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to a budget deal. This deadlock raises the possibility of a potential shutdown, although the likelihood is low that it happens on Friday, according to multiple House and Senate sources.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) refused to meet with Trump last week after the president said on Twitter they ""want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes."" Trump added: ""I don’t see a deal!"" Following that high-profile debacle, Schumer and McConnell spoke privately on the Senate floor in a bid to get the budget discussions moving again. The White House has also been working to try to reschedule a meeting between Trump and the “Big Four,” as the top congressional leaders from both parties are nicknamed. Such a meeting could happen in the coming days, according to GOP and Democratic aides. There have been discussions between Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) on a possible DACA deal. Senate insiders said there “other lines of discussion” on DACA as well. In the House, Ryan and his leadership team have vowed for weeks to keep DACA and year-end spending negotiations separate — at least publicly. Ryan, however, now is getting squeezed by both ends of his conference, with a group of more than two dozen moderate Republicans from swing districts siding with Democrats and pushing Ryan to fix DACA by 2018. McConnell lashed out at Democrats on Sunday for tying Dreamers to the funding bill. McConnell noted that Trump has until March to make any decision on deportations for Dreamers, and he clearly wants to decouple the issue from the budget negotiations. “That's a ridiculous idea. There is no crisis,” McConnell said on ABC’s “This Week.” ""The president has given us until March to address the issue of undocumented children who came into the country … and are in a kind of difficult spot. But there's no emergency.” McConnell added: “I don't think the Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a non-emergency that we can address anytime between now and March. That's a very untenable position."" By KEVIN ROBILLARD Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney also downplayed the possibility of a shutdown, but he noted that certain blocs of lawmakers could derail a short-term CR. “You know, it's funny to see now that the Republicans are in charge, I think there's a group of right-wingers in the House who say they want to shut the government down,” Mulvaney said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “There's a group of Democrats who want to shut the government down over DACA. And there's a group of lawmakers from some of the hurricane states who want to shut the government down until they get what they want.” When he was in the House, Mulvaney supported the 2013 government shutdown, which Republicans forced in hopes of getting Congress to defund Obamacare, and he played a key role in a 2011 crisis in which some conservatives balked at raising the federal debt ceiling. Matt House, Schumer’s communications director, said the burden of keeping the government open is on the Republicans, as they control the White House, House and Senate. “Everyone knows the Republicans are in charge. If the government shuts down, it will be squarely on their back,” House said. Even as they wrestle with a potential shutdown, Ryan and McConnell will try to quickly reach a deal on a tax package following the Senate’s passage of a $1.5 trillion tax bill on a party line vote late Friday night. Discussions have already begun between House and Senate tax writers, and GOP aides said a potential agreement could emerge as early as this week. The two chambers have passed bills that diverge on key issues, including amending the popular mortgage-interest deduction, taxing small businesses and keeping the alternative minimum tax, which Republicans have long promised to kill. Ryan and McConnell will formally name conferees for the House-Senate tax talks this week. Russia will also be on the agenda as FBI Director Christopher Wray testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Trump launched a broad Twitter attack Sunday on the FBI. ""After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters — worst in History!"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness."" Trump added: ""Tainted (no, very dishonest?) FBI ‘agent’s role in Clinton probe under review.’ Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge."" Trump was referring to media reports that a lead agent on the FBI’s probe of Hillary Clinton’s private email server sent text messages to another agent critical of the president. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty last week to lying to the FBI, a huge blow to the president and a major step for special counsel Robert Mueller's criminal probe. Flynn’s plea deal is a sign Mueller's investigation is intensifying, with a focus on coordination between Flynn and other Trump aides and their interactions with Russian officials during and after the presidential campaign. The furor over sexual harassment will continue to roil Capitol Hill as well. Longtime Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan is supposed to announce his plans following allegations from three women that he harassed them when they worked in his office. Pelosi and other top Democrats have called for Conyers to resign, but so far he has not done so. Elections By ELENA SCHNEIDER Reps. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.) and Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) also have come under fire for harassment allegations, while Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) faces an ethics probe over claims that he improperly touched six women. The House Administration Committee will hold a hearing on the issue Thursday. The heads of the House Employment Counsel and Office of Compliance — who have been involved in secret settlements with harassment victims — will testify at that session. As if that’s not enough, the House will also take up a controversial bill to expand the use of “concealed carry” permits. The “Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act,” authored by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), allows concealed carry permit holders to take their weapons into other states that allow such permits. The bill is a top priority for the powerful National Rifle Association, but it is vehemently opposed by gun-control groups and some law-enforcement associations. The Hudson bill will be paired with a proposal to “fix” the National Instant Criminal Background Check System after it was revealed that a mass shooter in Texas was able to a purchase a gun despite a domestic violence charge. A third piece of the GOP gun package includes language seeking guidance from Attorney General Jeff Sessions on whether there can be criminal penalties imposed for using a “bump stock” during a crime. Those devices dramatically increase the fire for semi-automatic rifles and were used by the shooter in the Oct. 1 tragedy in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. There have been calls to ban bump stocks, but so far Republicans in Congress have waited to see whether the Trump administration can handle the issue through new regulations.

Since 1927, TIME has identified the Person of the Year, recognizing the person or group of people who most influenced the news and the world — for better or for worse — during the past year. In recent years, the shortlist for Person of the Year has included the Silence Breakers of the #MeToo movement, Hillary Clinton, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Black Lives Matter activists, CRISPR scientists and Beyoncé. Here are the 10 finalists selected by TIME editors this year: The 45th president of the U.S., and TIME’s 2016 Person of the Year, marked his second year in office through navigating crises involving both himself and his staff, attacking an encircling investigation implicating people close to him, and enacting several controversial policies, ranging from separations at the border to an international trade war with China. More than 2,000 families were separated at the U.S. border this year under a Trump Administration policy aimed at deterring illegal immigration. Prompting backlash, the “zero tolerance” policy was announced in April and formally ended in June, and resulted in thousands of children being held in federal government facilities while their parents were sent to jail. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin secured a landslide victory in the country’s March elections, extending his term for another six years against the backdrop of scrutiny over Russia’s involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the U.K., and increasing tension with Ukraine. Featured as a runner up for TIME’s 2017 Person of the Year, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has continued to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election as well as key figures involved in the 2016 Trump campaign and administration. The investigation headed by the former FBI Director has already resulted in more than 191 criminal charges against 32 people and three companies. Director Ryan Coogler, 32, created this year’s phenomenally successful Marvel film Black Panther. The superhero movie, set in the fictional African country of Wakanda, featured a largely black cast and had the third-highest grossing U.S. release of all time. California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, 52, became a symbol for survivors of sexual assault as she testified against in front of senators in September about her allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee and now Judge Brett Kavanaugh. A prolific commentator and critic of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, journalist Jamal Khashoggi was last seen entering the country’s consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Believed to have been murdered on the orders of the Crown Prince, his death prompted international outcry and scrutiny of the Saudi regime. After 17 people were killed on Valentine’s Day in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., students from the school organized the #NeverAgain movement and the March for Our Lives demonstrations across America, campaigning for gun-control reforms to prevent similar tragedies. Since hosting Kim Jong Un’s sister at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has met his counterpart from the North in three historic summits on the future of the Korean Peninsula this year, as well as brokering the landmark meeting between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump. Former Hollywood actor and activist Meghan Markle traded in her roles on screen for a royal title in May, when she married Britain’s Prince Harry to the delight of captivated crowds across the U.K. and millions more worldwide.

374,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mass-shootings-preventable/,"Top psychiatrist says schizophrenia -- whose symptoms the Navy Yard shooter exhibited -- is the main factor in half the U.S. mass shootings A well-known psychiatrist believes most of the mass murders in the U.S. could be prevented if society would properly treat serious mental illness, like schizophrenia, a disease of the brain that Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis showed signs of.  Dr. E. Fuller Torrey directly links this societal failure to the rash of mass shootings the U.S. has been experiencing. Torrey will be part of Steve Kroft's report on the state of mental health care for the 46th season premiere of 60 Minutes, Sun. Sept. 29 at 7 p.m. ET/PT. There have been more than 20 mass shooting in the U.S. over the past seven years, including those in Tucson, Ariz., Aurora, Colo., and at Virginia Tech, three instances where mental illness was an underlying cause.   Dr. Torrey says the U.S. has fallen down on the job of treating society's mentally ill and links this failure to the mass shootings.  ""They're directly related. About half of these mass killings are being done by people with severe mental illness, mostly schizophrenia,"" he tells Kroft.  ""If they were being treated, [the mass shootings perpetrated by mentally ill] would have been preventable."" The problem began when mental hospitals where most of the mentally ill were cruelly warehoused were shuttered. Inmates were supposed to get treatment in residential centers and receive supervision. But programs were never funded adequately and there aren't nearly enough. ""On any given day now, half of the people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses are not being treated,"" says Dr. Torrey.  Many of them wind up homeless and eventually find themselves in jails or prisons, says Torrey. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, in charge of Chicago's Cook County Jail, is all too familiar with the problem. ""I've got probably 2,500, 2,800 people with mental illness in my jail today and you look at their backgrounds, they've been in here 50, 60, 100 - we have some people who have been in here 400 times,"" he tells Kroft.   He says they are incarcerated for mostly minor offenses such as shoplifting.  ""There is no person that could argue otherwise that the jails have become the new insane asylums. That's what we are."" On Kroft's visit to Cook County Jail, the facility took in 15 severely, mentally ill persons just in one morning. Says Torrey, ""We have a grand experiment: What happens when you don't treat people? You're going to have to accept 10 to 15 percent of the homicides being killed by untreated, mentally ill people...accept Tucson and Aurora,"" he says.  ""These are the consequences.""

378,http://ew.com/tv/2017/12/22/best-late-night-tv-2017/,"Jimmy Kimmel's activism, Samantha Bee's takedowns, James Corden's Carpool Karaoke, and more. The late-night talk show game changed this year. It was the year Jimmy Kimmel became a pseudo-activist, Seth Meyers became a pseudo-news anchor, and Stephen Colbert brought some of his former Colbert Report flavor to The Late Show. It was also the year for distractions. Former FLOTUS Michelle Obama surprised Americans on The Tonight Show, Leslie Jones cemented herself as our favorite Game of Thrones recapper, and Jennifer Lawrence delivered one of the best interviews ever as a sub for Jimmy Kimmel Live. (Even Fallon’s chat with Cardi B didn’t top it.) These were the highs of late-night television in 2017 that sums up a year that jostled between polar opposites. The political became personal for Kimmel when his newborn son, William, was diagnosed with a congenital heart disease and required open heart surgery. Through a moving opening monologue that aired during an early May episode, the host revealed his family’s experience with a sick child to denounce Trump’s efforts to cut funding from the National Institute of Health. It was this moment that began Kimmel’s newfound efforts to advocate for health care coverage. “My first question: Do you think it’s a coincidence that Reggie Bush’s wife looks just like you? I don’t.” Thus began Jennifer Lawrence’s interview with Kim Kardashian West when she filled in for Kimmel on his show in November, and it just got better from there. Goodbyes are always hard, but Michelle Obama made her White House leave a little easier for lucky guests of The Tonight Show. Jimmy Fallon had some Americans record goodbye messages for the former First Lady, but they were surprised to discover that Obama was there in person to hear them. If, God forbid, Saturday Night Live abruptly ends for Leslie Jones, she could make a career out of recapping virtually anything. As Meyers learned on Late Night in August, Game of Thrones is so much better with the Ghostbusters funny gal on the couch. He even surprised her with Thrones actor Conleth Hill (“The Spider” Varys). “Oh my god, this is so cool!” Jones exclaimed. “I was saying that you can’t trust your ass, but you know sh— that you not telling everybody.” Someone get this woman a Game of Thrones after-show stat! Victoria Beckam’s secret project with James Corden was worth the wait. While many of her fans assumed her behind-the-scenes teases were signaling an epic Carpool Karaoke, the March episode of The Late Late Show revealed a more extravagant spoof of the movie Mannequin — with a Carpool Karaoke bit squeezed in. We heard Colbert, Meyers, John Oliver, Bill Maher, Kimmel, and Fallon address the sexual harassment allegations running rampant through Hollywood, but the female perspective was lacking in this arena. That’s because Samantha Bee (like Robin Thede) is a lone wolf in the sausage fest that is the late-night TV circuit. Her takedown of Alabama Senatorial candidate Roy Moore, Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K., and other “perverts” was hilarious and blisteringly poignant. The bromance between Harry Styles and Corden continued when the “Sign of the Times” singer got in the Carpool Karaoke van with the Late Late Show show host for a May show. Styles sang some of his hits, he sang some of other people’s hits, and he changed into various outfits — including a glistening “nippley” top. But now we also know the two shared a kiss for Corden’s Christmas mashup video, which makes it infinitely better. Many late-night hosts riffed on the Russia collusion scandal with the Trump administration, but Colbert actually did his own investigation on location. The host’s week in Russia featured an appearance on the country’s equivalent of The Tonight Show, a front-seat drive with a Russian oligarch, and — the pièce de résistance — a trip to Trump’s alleged “pee pee tape” hotel room from the infamous dossier. The stars came out for Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, Bee’s counter-event to the official White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Allison Janney channeled her West Wing character for the opening monologue, Steve Buscemi analyzed the Trump team’s obsession with “alternative facts,” and Will Ferrell reprised his impression of George W. Bush. “Helen Thomas asks tougher questions as a dead woman than any man at Fox News asks today,” Ferrell said with a grin. Better than any Crosswalk Theater — although, those were pretty spectacular this year — Corden assembled the cast of Thor: Ragnarok to surprise a movie theater audience in California with a live reenactment of the story. Watching Jeff Goldblum eat popcorn with the crowd while Cate Blanchett poo-pooed the whole thing was worth the watch. As Fallon said during the opening of his show in October, his mission was to entertain this year — even in the face of tragedy. So, in the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Adam Sandler joined Miley Cyrus on stage to perform an emotional cover of Dido’s “No Freedom.” “I love that there is no love without freedom,” Cyrus told Fallon afterwards, “and I think about that when these tragic events happen, what is music if we can’t go see our favorite artists perform because we’re scared of violence or we’re scared of losing someone that we love to go to a concert or go see a film?” Since her breakthrough performance in Girls Trip this summer, Tiffany Haddish continued her meteoric rise to superstar status. Even as a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live, she proved all she needs to shine is to be herself. No description of her swamp tour story about Will and Jada Pinkett Smith could best the way Haddish tells it. Weird Al Yankovik’s North Korea song channeled our angst in August when there Trump poked the bear of nuclear war with Kim Jong-un. It deserves a replay, as does Oliver’s message to the country. “When our president says words, he doesn’t necessarily mean what those words mean,” the Last Week Tonight host said. No one does “awkward” quite like Conan O’Brien. With his own version of Carpool Karaoke (but without the karaoke), he rode around London with Tom Cruise and every minute that went by made the trip more uncomfortable. After enduring 11 minutes of footage, Cruise put himself out of his misery by jumping out of the vehicle. Former alt-right Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos continually spread chaos with his divisive comments. But when he appeared on Maher’s Real Time — a decision for which the host got flack — guest panelist Larry Wilmore told the controversial personality something you normally can’t utter on television without getting bleeped. But it was HBO, so… “You can go f— yourself, all right?” Wilmore said. “If your argument is these people are stupid, you didn’t hear a word [U.S. counterterrorism intelligence officer Malcolm Nance] said earlier in this segment. He can talk circles around your pathetic douchy little ass.” It’s one of the most memorable moments of the year, full stop.",2017-12-22 09:00:34,15 best late-night TV moments of 2017,"medicine and health,television",72605,http://www.ew.com

381,https://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-asked-apple-to-unlock-iphone-before-trying-all-its-options/,"When the FBI asked Apple to unlock a terrorist's iPhone, the agency said it had no other way. It turns out the bureau barely looked, says a DOJ report. The DOJ's Office of the Inspector General said the FBI didn't exhaust all its options to unlock a terrorist's iPhone before asking Apple to help. The FBI made more of an effort to get Apple to unlock a terrorist's iPhone than it did trying to open the device on its own, according to a Justice Department report. The DOJ's Office of the Inspector General noted in its report (PDF) the FBI 's Cryptologic and Electronics Analysis Unit (CEAU), which cracks mobile devices, didn't start looking at outside methods to open the iPhone until just before Feb. 16, 2016, the day the FBI sent a court order to Apple demanding help. In testimony to Congress, then-FBI Director James Comey said the bureau had no other option than to ask Apple for help cracking the iPhone 5C of a terrorist who killed 14 people in a 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. An FBI department chief knew a vendor was ""almost 90 percent finished"" with a solution for breaking into the locked iPhone before reaching out to Apple, according to the report. The FBI's request culminated in an intense standoff between Apple and the bureau, which tried ordering the tech company to build a backdoor that would've allowed the government to unlock the iPhone. The case set up a legal battle between security and privacy. Apple declined to comment on the report. The FBI didn't respond to a request for comment. In December 2015, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, his wife, shot up a regional center during a holiday party. The FBI found Farook's iPhone 5C and wanted to search it for information on the terrorist attack. That led to the FBI demanding that Apple unlock the device because the agency said it couldn't do it on its own. ""The FBI's leadership went straight to the nuclear option -- attempting to force Apple to circumvent its encryption -- before attempting to see if their in-house hackers or trusted outside suppliers had the technical capability to break in to the San Bernardino terrorist's iPhone,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. ""It's clear now that the FBI was far more interested in using this horrific terrorist attack to establish a powerful legal precedent than they were in promptly gaining access to the terrorist's phone."" The agency dropped its order just a day before the FBI and Apple were due to go to trial. The FBI had spent almost a million dollars on an outside vendor that was able to crack open the phone. The Inspector General's report said the CEAU chief didn't want to use this solution, according to testimony from FBI Executive Assistant Director Amy Hess. Hess ""became concerned that the CEAU chief did not seem to want to find a technical solution, and that perhaps he knew of a solution but remained silent in order to pursue his own agenda of obtaining a favorable court ruling against Apple,"" the report said. Despite Hess' concern, the report said no one in the FBI withheld any knowledge, but the CEAU chief was ""frustrated that the case against Apple could no longer go forward."" The Office of the Inspector General wrote that its investigation suggests the FBI didn't look at all its possible options, including with the outside vendors. After an outside vendor demonstrated it could unlock the iPhone without Apple's help, the CEAU chief confronted the FBI official who coordinated the effort, and asked, ""Why did you do that for?"" The watchdog's report concluded that the FBI was telling the truth in its testimony to Congress and its court filings but that there were multiple miscommunications among the agency's rank and file that lead to issues. The FBI told the Inspector General's office that it was addressing the miscommunication issues, according to the report. First published March 27, 1 p.m. PT.Update, 2:17 p.m.: Adds comment from Sen.

          / CBS News Online threats against women, laws that permit concealed carrying of handguns, and the billion-dollar video game industry all collided this week when gaming critic Anita Sarkeesian canceled an appearance at Utah State University. Late Monday night, someone sent an email to various university staff members threatening to kill Sarkeesian and others at her speech, which was planned for Wednesday. ""I have at my disposal a semi-automatic rifle, multiple pistols and a collection of pipe bombs. This will be the deadliest school shooting in American history,"" read the threat. ""You have 24 hours to cancel Sarkeesian's talk. You might be foolish enough to just beef up security at the event, but that won't save you. Even if they're able to stop me, there are plenty of feminists on campus who won't be able to defend themselves. One way or another, I'm going to make sure they die."" Early Tuesday morning, the university contacted Sarkeesian, as well as police and federal law enforcement, to attempt to determine whether the threat was credible, and to create a plan to keep Sarkeesian safe during her visit, according to USU spokesperson Tim Vitale. Online threats against women are real, pervasive and must be taken seriously by law enforcement agencies and educational institutions alike. The USU threat came amid a series of online threats levied  against female video game designers and critics of how women are portrayed in video  games, a controversy called ""Gamergate."" ""Gamergate is what I call a sexist temper tantrum,"" Sarkeesian told CBS This Morning. Now a hashtag on Twitter, Gamergate reportedly began in August  when the ex-boyfriend of game designer Zoe Quinn accused her of  sleeping with a gaming reporter for positive coverage of her game  ""Depression Quest."" Quinn was soon inundated with rape and death  threats and reportedly had to leave her home after her address was published. The ugliness spread through social media, becoming what the Washington Post calls ""an Internet culture war."" Some involved express complaints about what they  perceived as a too-close  relationship between game developers and  journalists who cover the genre, while many others hurl sexist and often  violent threats against women involved in gaming and those who support  opening up the male dominated video game world. Game designer  Brianna Wu was the victim of graphic threats, and according to her Twitter account, also left her home last weekend. Sarkeesian herself is no stranger to death threats:  she has been receiving them since at least 2012 when she launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a video series called ""Tropes vs. Women"" which examines the role of women in video games. Vitale said that although Utah police determined the danger in this instance was not real, they still prepared extra security for the event and felt confident they could keep Sarkeesian and their students safe. Utah, however, is one of seven states which allow people with proper permits to carry concealed weapons on campus.  Sarkeesian asked if USU could bar guns from the auditorium for the event and the university said no. That's when she decided to call off her appearance. ""It's sort of mind-boggling to me that they couldn't take efforts to make sure there were no guns in an auditorium that was threatened with guns and a mass shooting,"" Sarkeesian told The Associated Press. ""I don't understand how they could be so cut and dry about it."" But according to democratic Utah State Rep. Carolyn Spackman Moss, ""the university's hands were tied"" by the state law. ""It really undermines the idea of higher education that we can't have someone controversial come speak,"" Moss told 48 Hours' Crimesider. ""What other person is going to decline an invitation now?"" To the women out there scared to make games because they see this happening, I swear - WE WILL CHANGE THIS CULTURE FOR YOU. To University of Maryland law professor Danielle Citron, Gamergate and the USU incident are examples of ""how we trivialize online threats against women."" Citron, the author of ""Hate Crimes in Cyberspace,"" has spent years studying how women are victimized online. ""Threats like these are designed to interfere with women's daily lives,"" says Citron. ""They are designed to silence, to humiliate, and to terrify."" In March, 48 Hours' Crimesider examined how law enforcement has been playing catch-up with cyber-stalkers, and trying to shed the attitude that women who receive online threats should just ""turn off the computer.""  There has been progress in this area: the 2013 re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act included language outlawing online harassment against a specific person, for example. In a statement to the Washington Post, the Entertainment Software Association, a trade group representing video game companies, spoke out against Gamergate: ""Threats of violence and harassment are wrong. They have to stop. There is no place in the video game community -- or our society -- for personal attacks and threats."" Citron told Crimesider that while she is pleased that more people seem to be ""waking up"" to the problem of online threats against women, Gamergate is an example of how the threats themselves ""seem to be escalating at a rapid clip.""

          / CBS/AP Updated at 2:03 p.m. EST Army psychiatrist Maj. Nadil Malik Hasan, suspected in the shooting rampage at Fort Hood, was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and could face the death penalty is convicted, according to an officials. Additional charges are possible as the investigation into the mass shooting continues, said Chris Grey, the spokesman for the Army's Criminal Investigation Division. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama  of all intelligence related to Hasan, and whether the information was properly shared and acted upon within government agencies. Authorities say Hasan walked into an on-base medical facility last Thursday and opened fire on dozens of unsuspecting fellow soldiers with a semi-automatic handgun. Thirteen people died and 29 more were wounded. Hasan, who will be tried in a military court, is believed to have acted alone in the attack, Grey said. Special Section: Tragedy at Fort Hood Officials familiar with the case told the Associated Press it is still possible to charge Hasan with a 14th count of murder related to the death of the unborn child of a pregnant shooting victim. John Galligan, Hasan's civilian attorney, said his military co-counsel told him that charges were being read to Hasan in the hospital without his lawyers present. ""I don't like it. I feel like I'm being left out of the loop,"" Galligan said. ""I guess it's 13 charges, but I don't like to have to guess in this situation."" Months before last week's shootings, doctors and staff overseeing Hasan's training reported viewing him at times as belligerent, defensive and argumentative in his frequent discussions of his Muslim faith, according to a military official familiar with several group discussions about Hasan. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity. Hasan was characterized in meetings as a mediocre student and lazy worker, a matter of concern among the doctors and staff at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, a military medical school in Bethesda, Maryland, the official said. The  were shared with other military officials considering his assignment after he finished his medical training, and the consensus was to send the 39-year-old psychiatrist to Fort Hood in Texas, the official said. One of the largest military installations, it was considered the best assignment for Hasan because other doctors could handle the workload if he continued to perform poorly and his superiors could document any continued behavior problems, the official said.

Hood Shooting: Composure Under FireRadical Imam's Web Site Praises Hasan List of Fort Hood Dead, Wounded Hasan repeatedly referred to his strong religious views in discussions with classmates, his superiors and even in his research work, the official said. His behavior, while at times perceived as intense and combative, was not unlike the zeal of others with strong religious views. But some doctors and staff were concerned that their unfamiliarity with the Muslim faith would lead them to unfairly single out Hasan's behavior, the official said. Some in the group questioned Hasan's sympathies as an Army psychiatrist, whether he would be more aligned with Muslims fighting U.S. troops. There also was some concern about whether he should continue to serve in the military, the official said. At one point, Hasan's supervisors ordered him to attend a university lecture series on Islam, the Middle East and terrorism, hoping to steer him toward productive work addressing potential concerns of Muslims in the military, according to The Washington Post. Hasan attended the lectures late last year or early this year, The Post reported Thursday, quoting a Walter Reed staff member who spoke anonymously because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly. A joint terrorism task force overseen by the FBI learned late last year of Hasan's repeated contact with a radical Muslim cleric who encouraged Muslims to kill U.S. troops in Iraq. The FBI said in a statement late Wednesday that the task force did not refer early information about Hasan to superiors because it concluded he wasn't linked to terrorism. The doctors and staff who discussed concerns about Hasan had several group conversations about him that started in early 2008 during regular monthly meetings and ended as he was finishing a fellowship in disaster and preventive psychology this summer, the official familiar with the discussions said. They saw no signs of mental problems, no risk factors that would predict violent behavior. And the group discussed other factors that suggested Hasan would continue to thrive in the military, factors that mitigated their concerns, the official said. According to the official, records reviewed by Hasan's superiors described nearly 20 years of military service, including nearly eight years as an enlisted soldier; completion of three rigorous medical school programs, albeit as a student the group characterized in their discussions as mediocre; his resilience after the deaths of his parents early in his medical education, and an otherwise polite and gentle nature when not discussing religion. Citing the investigation and the Privacy Act, the Army and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences have released only minimal details of Hasan's career. He entered the Army in 1997 as a 2nd lieutenant and started the medical school program, according to a service spokesman in Washington. But school records from Barstow Community College in Barstow, California, where Hasan was a student from 1989 to 1990, show his military service began much earlier. Maureen Stokes, a spokeswoman for the college, said the records indicate he was a private first class with an infantry unit at Fort Irwin, California. Hasan received 10 credits for his military experience, she said. First published on November 12, 2009 / 11:40 AM © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

FBI arrests California man for alleged Christmas terror plot — -- The FBI has arrested a California tow truck driver for allegedly attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and plotting a Christmas-time attack. Officials say Everitt Aaron Jameson ultimately said he didn’t want to go through with it, after an FBI employee accidentally called his phone with an identifiable Washington D.C.-based phone number. The bureau didn’t believe him, searched his home and found weapons and a martyrdom note referring to President Donald Trump. Jameson posted radical jihadist messages online and offered to use his employer-provided tow truck for the “cause,” according to a criminal complaint filed by an FBI agent. In 2009, he attended basic recruit training for the Marine Corps and later graduated with a “sharpshooter” qualification, but he was discharged for fraudulent enlistment because he failed to disclose a history of asthma. He also voiced support for the Halloween Day truck attack in New York which killed eight people. In September, an FBI informant flagged the FBI to his Facebook account — he called himself ""vanity everittj"". According to the informant, Jameson “loved” a Facebook post on Nov. 29 that showed an image of Santa standing in New York with a box of dynamite and a messages that read, “ISIS post image of Santa with dynamite threatening attack on New York.” In late October, Jameson and the informant exchanged private messages, including a message on Oct. 29 in which James described himself as a convert, saying, “This is what will make me more useful. I can blend in. Or shock and awe.” On Nov. 2, after the Halloween attack in New York in which eight people died when a rented truck was used to kill pedestrians on a jogging path, Jameson told the informant, “I’m glad to know we Muslims are finally hitting back. Allahu Akbar! The Kuffar deserve everything and more the lives they have taken.” The next day, Jameson filled out a “Franchise Tow Truck Driver Application” with the police department in Modesto, California. Weeks later, FBI agents reported that it appeared as though Jameson was working for a local towing company. On Dec. 11 — less than two weeks ago — an undercover FBI agent began communicating with Jameson online. On Dec. 16, Jameson met in person with a second undercover FBI agent, and they discussed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Jameson’s ability to help in the fight, and then Jameson’s belief that the U.S. needed another attack like New York or the deadly 2015 San Bernardino, Calif. mass shooting in which armed gunmen killed 14 people at Inland Regional Center. Jameson said he wanted to use a combo of the two attacks — vehicle and firearms. Jameson specifically named Pier 29 in San Francisco as a target because he had been there and knew it was heavily crowded. Jameson said he also wanted to use explosives and that Christmas Day would be the perfect day. Jameson said he would go to the mountains to build bombs for the attack. He wrote a letter stating among other things: “You all have brought this upon yourselves. There are no innocent Kuffar! Each and every Kuffar in this Nationalistic, Godless society has a hand in this. You’ve allowed Donald J Trump to give away Al Quds to the Jews. Both You and he are wrong, it belongs to the Muslemeen.” On Dec. 18, an FBI employee mistakenly called Jameson with an identifiable DC number. Later that day, the second undercover agent messaged Jameson for a follow-up meeting. Jameson told the agent, “I also don’t think I can do this after all. I’ve reconsidered.” FBI raided his home in Modesto on Dec. 20. They found the martyrdom letter he left behind, and also found several firearms. During the raid, Jameson told the FBI of his support for ISIS and his plan for attack, noting that he would be happy if an attack was carried out. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-12-22 17:42:36, FBI arrest man for allegedly planning ISIS-inspired Christmas season attack,"armament, defense and military forces,terrorism",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Sheryl Crow discusses her new song inspired by the Sandy Hook shooting — -- Sheryl Crow today debuted an original song that marks the fifth anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 students and six educators. ""The Dreaming Kind"" was written by Crow, a nine-time Grammy winner, after the October shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people and injured nearly 500 others attending a country music festival. ""I didn’t know what I was going to do with it and then suddenly we were presented with the Sandy Hook Promise and the opportunity to have a song for it,"" Crow said today on ""Good Morning America."" ""I said, ‘I just have written this song which is basically about what they went through.'"" Proceeds from downloads of the song will benefit Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit organization that uses educational programs to help prevent acts of gun violence before they occur. The organization was founded by Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, was killed in the shooting, and Mark Barden, who also lost his son, Daniel, at the Newtown, Conn., school. The 20 students killed were 6 and 7 years old. Crow's song represents the voice of the parents of Sandy Hook victims and others working to end gun violence. “I’m giving it all I got; there’ll be no more wasting precious time; giving it all I got; and nothing’s ever going to change my mind,"" the lyrics read. Crow, a mother of two, performed the song today with her elementary school-age niece, Ava. ""This is just like a foot in the door to an overdue conversation that has been needed ... for a long time,"" Crow told ABC News' Rob Marciano before her performance. ""The song was really just a project of love."" Crow said her inspiration for writing the song came from ""the anger and the frustration and the disillusionment"" she felt after the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas. ""After Sandy Hook, we all felt everything was going to change, and yet it has not changed,"" Crow said. ""People cling to the Second Amendment but really what we’re talking about with Sandy Hook Promise is just a sensible conversation about what can we do to curtail what’s happening in this country."" Along with Crow's song, Sandy Hook Promise released a new public service announcement today that calls on viewers to learn the warning signs exhibited by those who may act violently toward themselves or others. The PSA also encourages viewers to take action to prevent acts of violence before they occur. The PSA, called ""Tomorrow's News,"" depicts mock news coverage of a school shooting from the day before it occurred, to illustrate how it possibly could have been prevented. ""The goal is quite simple, to save lives,"" Hockley said. ""We know that our training has already averted multiple school shootings and suicides and other acts of harm."" Hockley described the organization's approach to ending gun violence as ""understanding who’s at risk at potentially hurting themselves or someone else and how can we take action now, before a tragedy happens."" Sandy Hook Promise is holding a “moment of silence” via Facebook Live on Dec. 14 to commemorate the five-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook Shooting.

Substitute teacher barricaded door with couch to protect kids during deadly shooting — -- A 74-year-old substitute teacher and a custodian jumped into action and helped save lives during a shooting at a New Mexico high school Thursday that killed two students, authorities said today. Substitute teacher Kathleen Potter had 16 students in a classroom with her at Aztec High School in Aztec, about 180 miles northwest of Albuquerque, when she heard the shooting, according to police. She didn't have a key to lock the door so she put all of the students in a storage area and the barricaded the door with a couch, authorities said. The shooter -- a former Aztec High School student -- came in and started screaming and fired multiple rounds through the walls, hitting no one, authorities said. When Thomas Hill, a custodian, heard the shots, he saw the shooter and followed him and shouted at him authorities said. The custodian also warned others and yelled at teachers to lock down, police said. The suspect, identified as 21-year-old William Atchison, died after the shooting. A law enforcement source told ABC News that officers found the suspected gunman dead, a gun and multiple loaded magazines near him. Authorities today said the shooting was a ""planned event,"" with the suspect allegedly writing out a schedule for the morning, including ""die"" at 8 a.m. Police said the suspect disguised himself as a student and went to the school as buses were letting people in. Authorities said he wanted to create ""as much carnage as he possibly could."" The 21-year-old went to a bathroom and was preparing to confront students, police said, and in that bathroom is where victim Francisco Fernandez was shot and killed; authorities said Fernandez had no chance to survive. The suspect then went to the hallway, where he encountered Casey Marquez and fatally shot her, police said. He then allegedly fired multiple rounds through the hallway. Authorities called Atchison -- who lived in Aztec with his parents and worked at a local gas station -- a ""coward"" and ""evil."" In March 2016, federal authorities interviewed Atchison regarding a threatening post he allegedly made on an online gaming forum; investigators say he asked, ""if you’re going to commit a mass shooting, does anyone know about assault rifles?” The FBI said Atchison was cooperative when they interviewed him and that Atchison explained he was simply “trolling” the internet.

Pulse nightclub hero to be dismissed by police department — -- A Florida police officer who was hailed a hero for swiftly rescuing a victim in the Pulse nightclub shooting last year will be dismissed from the force at the end of the month. Omar Delgado, a member of the Eatonville Police Department, was among the first officers to respond to the attack at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, on June 12, 2016. He was credited with pulling victim Angel Colon to safety after gunman Omar Mateen opened fire on clubgoers, killing 49 people. Colon, who was shot multiple times, told ABC News in an interview last year that he would have ""bled to death"" if not for Delgado, who rescued him roughly 25 minutes after gunfire erupted, allowing Colon to get lifesaving treatment. Delgado told ABC affiliate WFTV in Orlando that he has been on light duty since the massacre because he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. He said the Eatonville Police Department has deemed him unfit for duty and he was told Monday that his last day on the job will be Dec. 31, six months before he qualifies for a pension from the town. He has been a member of the department for over nine years. ""They can't find it in their hearts to find six more months, just so I can be vested and then just move on with my life,"" Delgado told WFTV. ""I needed help, and I guess I'm being punished because I asked for help."" Eatonville Police Chief Joseph Jenkins confirmed Delgado's dismissal for ABC News but wouldn't provide details on the reasons for it. ""We have reached an agreement with Officer Delgado, and we will be terminating his employment on Dec. 31. There are circumstances I can't go into because of protected information,"" Jenkins said via telephone today. The Eatonville Town Council voted Tuesday night to pay some of Delgado's accrued sick time before he's out of a job. Eatonville Mayor Eddie Cole refused to answer WFTV's questions about Delgado's termination. ""There are some things that I'm not privileged to say,"" Cole said. Colon attended Tuesday's council meeting to speak out against Delgado's dismissal. ""He was my hero,"" Colon told WFTV. ""He saved my life, and for them to just do what they're doing in front of my face, it's a slap to my face as well."" ""God sent him, and he was my hero that night,"" Colon added.

Sandy Hook: Five years later, victims' families find new purpose — -- Five years after a mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school horrified the nation, some family members of victims reflected on how their lives have changed since the tragedy, as they work together to prevent future acts of gun violence. ""We simply don't want other parents to be in our position. We know that these acts of violence are preventable,"" Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown five years ago, told ABC News' Amy Robach. ""We feel responsible to teach people how to prevent them from happening."" Hockley recalled how her Dylan, who had autism, loved to pretend to he was a butterfly. ""He would flap his arms up and down whenever he got excited, which was pretty much all the time, and I asked him once, 'Why do you flap?' and he said, 'because I'm a beautiful butterfly,'"" she said. ""At his funeral I talked about how the theory of a butterfly flapping its wings on one side of the world can cause a hurricane on the other side,"" Hockley said. ""I thought about Dylan as our butterfly to help create change in our country, positive, transformative change."" Hockley co-founded the Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit organization that uses educational programs to help prevent acts of gun violence before they occur. The community of Newtown was thrust into the national spotlight five years ago this week when it was rocked by tragedy after a gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Twenty students -- between the ages of 6 and 7 -- and six educators were killed. The shooting drew many immediate calls for reform or action to prevent a similar tragedy from ever happening again. Just this October, however, the U.S. suffered the deadliest mass shooting in history when a gunman killed 59 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mark Barden, who also co-founded Sandy Hook Promise after his son, Daniel, was killed at the elementary school, told ABC News that he ""made a very deliberate decision to invest every fiber of my being into trying to prevent that from happening again."" Barden recalled his son as ""an exceptionally sweet, compassionate little soul."" ""My one little Daniel has in his life affected so many people in a positive way, but in his murder I can't even tell you,"" Barden said. ""We're training people, students, parents, teachers, how to recognize the warning signs that people give off before they hurt themselves before they hurt someone else,"" Barden said. Bill Sherlach told ABC News that the work he is doing now to prevent mass shootings is in honor of his wife, Mary Sherlach, who worked as a psychologist at Sandy Hook Elementary school where she was murdered. ""I hope she would be very proud,"" Bill Sherlach said. ""We're making a lot of lemonade ... we've been given a whole lot of lemons, and we're just making a whole lot of lemonade, and doing everything we can, to hopefully make her proud of us."" Sherlach added that they have been told that their work has prevented school shootings. ""We've already done it,"" he said. ""There's been a number of school shootings that we know we've thwarted. Sandy Hook Promise released a new video today, approximately five years after the tragedy. The public service announcement calls on viewers to learn the warning signs exhibited by those who may act violently towards themselves or others, and to take action to prevent acts of violence before they occur. The PSA, called ""Tomorrow's News,"" depicts mock news coverage of a school shooting from the day before it occurred, to illustrate how it possibly could have been prevented. ""It's easy to know the right thing to do after it's too late to do anything,"" Greg Hahn, the chief creative officer at BBDO New York, the advertising firm that helped create the video, said in a statement. ""In this PSA, we illustrate that when it comes to gun violence prevention, the stakes are too high to let that continue to be the case,"" Hahn added. Hockley told ABC News that ""it is not a comfortable piece to watch."" ""But you know what? Gun violence isn't comfortable,"" she added.

391,http://abcnews.go.com/International/2017-review-biggest-stories-year/story?id=51792152,"From hurricanes to Harvey Weinstein, these were the biggest stories of the year. The biggest headlines of 2017 — -- It was a year we won't soon forget. From Donald Trump's inauguration to the Harvey Weinstein scandal, these were the biggest stories of the year. Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Jan. 20 after his stunning upset over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Setting the tone for Trump's tumultuous first year in office and the administration's tense relationship with the press, Sean Spicer berated reporters over the crowd size at Trump's inauguration two days later in his debut as White House press secretary. ""This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration —- period —- both in person and around the globe,"" Spicer said. ""These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong."" he added, taking no questions from reporters after reading the brief statement. Spicer announced his resignation from as the White House press secretary in July after just six months on the job. The controversies persisted throughout the year, from Trump's relentless tweeting at all hours of the day to the ousting, resignation and job changes of more than a dozen administration officials. And who can forget Trump's coining of a new word, ""covfefe""? While testifying before the House Committee on Intelligence in March, then-FBI director James Comey confirmed the bureau was investigating Russian interference in the U.S. election and ""any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts."" Trump fired Comey suddenly in May after the president allegedly spoke to Comey about dropping the FBI's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Comey wrote about his Feb. 14 meeting with the president in a memo, details of which were first reported by The New York Times and were later confirmed to ABC News by sources close to the former FBI director. According to a source who read the memo, which Comey shared with top FBI associates, Comey wrote that Trump said, ""I hope you can let this go,"" referring to the inquiry into Flynn's conduct. ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,"" said Trump, according to the source who read the memo. ""He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Trump's alleged request to Comey about the investigation came the day after Flynn was forced to resign after misleading the administration about his contacts with Russian officials. Trump has repeatedly denied asking Comey to halt an investigation into Flynn. “I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn,” he tweeted in December. “Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!” After Comey's termination, the U.S. Department of Justice appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI chief, in May as special counsel to lead the probe into Russian election interference and potential ties to the Trump campaign. By mid-December, Mueller's team of investigators had brought federal charges against four people -- including Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's ambassador. A massive fire engulfed a residential high-rise building in London in the early morning hours of July 14. Since then, London's Metropolitan Police Service said they have searched every apartment on every floor and every communal area of the 24-story Grenfell Tower and examined 15.5 tons of debris on each floor. Police said the death toll stands at 71 after recovering and identifying all those believed to have died in the blaze. Police previously estimated that about 80 people had died in the fire, which started in a refrigerator on the fourth floor and raced all the way to the top within minutes. Many of the survivors remain displaced without permanent housing. Three monster hurricanes ravaged Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands within a four-week span. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on Aug. 25, killing more than 80 people in the Lone Star State and causing an estimated $150 billion in damage. Hurricane Irma made landfall twice in southern Florida on Sept. 10, killing scores of people there and elsewhere in the United States as well as in the Caribbean. Among those killed were residents of a nursing home that lost its air conditioning in Hollywood, Florida. Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, damaging thousands of homes and wiped out power to the entire U.S. territory. Nearly three months after the storm hit, the island's power grid was operating at only 70 percent of capacity. The Puerto Rican government said the number of deaths traceable to the calamitous storm was 64. But independent analyses by several news organizations found that the death toll was likely far higher than the official count, prompting Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello on Dec. 18 to order a review of every death on the island since Maria. “This is about more than numbers, these are lives: real people, leaving behind loved ones and families,” Rossello said in a statement, acknowledging that the death toll ""may be higher than the official count certified to date."" Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old retired accountant and high-stakes video poker player, opened fire on an outdoor music festival crowd along the Las Vegas Strip from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on Oct. 1. Fifty-eight people were killed and hundreds more were wounded, making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Authorities found Paddock dead inside his two-room suite alongside an arsenal of weapons. The Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner later determined that Paddock, a resident of Mesquite, Nevada, had committed suicide by shooting himself in the mouth. Questions about the gunman's motive for the shooting remain unanswered. A deluge of sexual misconduct allegations were made against some of the most powerful men in politics, media and the entertainment industry. The issues are nothing new, but this year's worldwide wave of accusations was unprecedented and seemed to pour out after reports surfaced in early October that movie magnate Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexually harassing or assaulting numerous women for decades. Weinstein has acknowledged inappropriate behavior but has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex. “Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,” his spokesman previously said. The hashtag #MeToo went viral on social media in the wake of the allegations, as countless women -- and some men -- around the world were emboldened to share their own stories. Along with Weinstein, many of the accused men have suffered consequences. Tensions between the United States and North Korea were sky-high this year, with the leaders of the two countries exchanging threats and schoolyard taunts, like ""dotard"" and ""Little Rocket Man."" But the tensions were exacerbated by North Korea's tests of a hydrogen bomb and of ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the U.S. mainland. North Korea conducted over a dozen ballistic missile tests in 2017. The latest was Nov. 29, when North Korea said it launched a new, nuclear-capable weapon that could allegedly reach the entire continental United States. North Korean state television said the new intercontinental ballistic missile, which it called a Hwasong 15, was ""significantly more"" powerful than the previous long-range ICBM the country had tested. The Hwasong 15 reached an altitude of 2,800 miles, making it the highest North Korean missile test to date, two U.S. officials confirmed. It traveled for an estimated 50 minutes, the longest of the country's missile flights, an official said. ""The missile was launched from Sain Ni, North Korea, and traveled about 1,000 kilometers [about 621 miles] before splashing down in the Sea of Japan, within Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ),"" Pentagon spokesman Col. Robert Manning said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Defense said the missile did not pose a threat to North America, its territories or its allies. Trump later addressed the ICBM launch while appearing before reporters at the White House, pledging, ""We will take care of it. ... It is a situation that we will handle."" In response to the Nov. 29 launch, the United Nations Security Council adopted strong new sanctions against North Korea. The phenomenon began during the 2016 NFL preseason when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling before games to raise awareness of social injustice, including police brutality against black Americans. But the protests really took off over the next year, with players from across the league joining Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the national anthem. ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media after taking a knee. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" In early March, Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers, making him a free agent. Kaepernick remains unsigned, and some have accused the NFL of blacklisting him, according to ESPN. In late September, Trump slammed the NFL for what he called the league's tolerance of players showing disrespect to the United States. ""Wouldn’t you love to see one of the NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'Get that son of a b---- off the field right now?'"" the president said amid thunderous applause and cheers from a crowd in Huntsville, Alabama. ""You know, some owner ... is going to say, 'That guy who disrespects our flag, he’s fired,'"" he said. San Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid, one of the first players to join Kaepernick in kneeling during the national anthem, defended the ongoing silent protests in an Oct. 10 interview on ABC's ""The View."" ""We have a constitutional right to protest. And that's all we're doing -- exercising it,"" Reid said. ""It's a peaceful protest.... We're simply trying to raise awareness around the issues that our country face[s]."" Reid said he was first inspired to join his teammate's protest after the death of Alton Sterling, a black man who was shot several times by police while being held on the ground in Reid's hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""At that point, I knew I needed to do something,"" he said. ""I need[ed] to use my platform to speak out for people who didn't have a voice."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-12-23 10:37:45, 2017 in review: The biggest stories of the year,"politics and government,united states politics and government",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

The man who opened fire inside at New Mexico high school on Thursday had disguised himself as a student and had previously been investigated by the FBI for making comments about plotting a mass shooting, authorities said. The shooter fatally shot two students before killing himself at the high school in Aztec, New Mexico, state police said. The San Juan County Sheriff's Office on Friday identified the shooter as William Atchison, 21, a former Aztec High School student who did not graduate. Authorities said they had found plans for the shooting in Atchison's home that included a detailed timeline, along with the line, ""If all goes according to plan, today is the day I die."" Francisco ""Paco"" Fernandez, the shooter's first victim. An FBI spokesperson said the agency had investigated Atchison in March 2016 for comments he made on a gaming website that were ""generally along the lines of 'If you're going to conduct a mass shooting, does anyone know about cheap assault rifles?'"" The FBI interviewed Atchison and his family at the time, but he told investigators he had no plans for an attack and did not own any guns. According to the FBI, Atchison was fond of making trolling comments online to get a rise out of people. On the day of the shooting, sheriff's officials said Atchison disguised himself as a student and even mingled with other students as they got off school buses to enter campus. He was carrying one pistol, a 9-mm Glock that he had purchased one month ago, as well as ""several magazines."" Casey Jordan Marquez, the shooter's second victim. Shortly after 8 a.m. as first period was beginning, Atchison was loading his weapon in a second-floor bathroom when he was discovered by the first victim, Francisco ""Paco"" Fernandez, an eleventh-grade student, who had excused himself from class, officials said. Atchison shot Fernandez and then walked into the hallway, where he encountered the second victim, Casey Jordan Marquez, 17, and killed her. He then began firing randomly, San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen. Four officers responded to the school ""within one minute"" of the dispatcher's call. The officers entered Aztec High by shooting out a window to confront the shooter because it was on lockdown, according to the sheriff's office. Shortly after officers entered, Atchison took his own life. According to New Mexico officials, no other students or faculty were injured in the shooting. 2 Students Killed in Aztec, N.M.

          / CBS News President Trump on Tuesday said he has directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to draft regulations that would ban any devices that would turn legal, semi-automatic firearms into automatic weapons, after studying the issue of bump stocks in light of the Las Vegas shooting in October. The president made the remarks from the White House East Room, as he hosted the Public Safety Medal of Valor Awards Ceremony. The comments marked the president's first public appearance in Washington since his brief speech Thursday after the Parkland shooting, and his remarks on bump stocks are the first he has made definitively proposing a policy solution related to gun control. Mr. Trump said his memo to Sessions directing the change came after months of reviewing the issue. The president has also indicated he would be open to universal background checks, which have wide public approval. The suspect in the Parkland massacre, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, did not use a bump stock device. The NRA said in a statement Tuesday night it ""cannot comment until an actual rule is published with specifics that we can review. The NRA's stance on this issue has not changed. Fully-automatic weapons have been heavily regulated since the 1930s, but banning semi-automatic firearms and accessories has been shown time and again to not prevent criminal activity and simply punishes the law-abiding for the criminal acts of others."" Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday night that ""whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must focus on strengthening background checks!"" Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks! The president said he is ""grieving for the community of Parkland in the great state of Florida."" ""We're working very hard to make sense of these events,"" the president told members of law enforcement and first responders there Tuesday. The president, echoing something Vice President Mike Pence said over the weekend, said school security will be a top priority for his administration. ""We cannot imagine the depth of their anguish, but we can pledge the strength of our resolve,"" he said of the victims and their families. ""And we must to do more to protect our children. We have to do more to protect our children."" The Justice Department did not give a timeline on when such regulations will be completed. ""The department understands this is a priority for the president and has acted quickly to move through the rulemaking process,"" the DOJ said in a statement. ""We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed."" The president also called for better physical protection of schools, and for better coordination between federal and state law enforcement in order to take ""swift action"" when there are warning signs. The FBI admitted last week it failed to follow up on a January tip about the suspect in the Florida shooting, who had been expelled from the high school. Bump stocks were used by Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter believed to be responsible for the most deadly mass shooting in modern American history, to kill dozens and injure hundreds in October. The Department of Justice began reviewing the matter, and Mr. Trump's announcement was the result of that review. The event Tuesday was intended to recognize those who have earned the highest possible valor award for public safety. Last year, Mr. Trump granted the award to the agents who risked their lives to protect members of Congress in the June congressional baseball practice shooting. The last time the president had appeared publicly in Washington was Friday, to commemorate the victims of the shooting in Parkland, Fla., that took 17 lives. On Friday night, he visited the hospital where some of those injured in the shooting are recovering, and spoke with local members of law enforcement who intervened.

395,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1720114,"A jury has acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of murder and involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco two years ago. Garcia Zarate, who is an undocumented immigrant, was found guilty of illegal firearms possession and could face a prison sentence of up to three years. Steinle’s killing was a horrible tragedy compounded by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, who, ignoring her family’s objections, bastardized her death into a political opportunity to ramp up his anti-immigrant agenda. Following the jury’s verdict, the tweeter in chief stayed true to form. “A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case,” he fumed, using her death to call for his wall. “No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration”:  The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!  A lie. “Garcia Zarate did have a history of drug charges,” noted Splinter, “but didn’t have a violent criminal record and spent most of his life in prison.” Trump and other anti-immigrant critics continually misrepresented Garcia Zarate as shooting Steinle in malice, when in fact the defense successfully argued the shooting was most likely accidental, since the bullet from the gun he had found actually ricocheted off the ground and then struck Steinle. “The defense also presented evidence regarding the SIG Sauer’s propensity to accidentally fire,” noted a surprisingly sober read from RedState. A tragedy nonetheless, but certainly not the cold-blooded killing Trump attempted to portray in order to further foment hate. Not that Trump really cared anyway. He only seems speak out when it’s one kind of gunshot victim—“For Donald Trump, we were just what he needed,” Steinle’s mom Liz Sullivan said last year, “beautiful girl, San Francisco, illegal immigrant, arrested a million times, a violent crime and yadda, yadda, yadda. We were the perfect storm for that man”—and one kind of person pulling the trigger. Meanwhile, what’s he done about the mass shooting in Las Vegas? What’s he done about all the black men and women shot dead, in front of their loved ones and on camera, by police? Unless it fits his agenda, Donald Trump doesn’t care. Steinle’s death is one tragedy, and the Trump administration’s continued exploitation of her death to demonize immigrants for political gain is the second. Already, Fox and Friends is urging regular viewer Trump to “take advantage” of the jury’s verdict to build his fucking wall. The White House later issued a statement calling for more border resources and saying that “had San Francisco enforced our Nation’s immigration laws, the Steinle family would be celebrating this holiday with all of their loved ones.” But in 2015, the family was deeply upset their personal tragedy was thrust into a national political debate by Trump and his campaign and later declined opportunities to meet with him: “All of a sudden now we’re against sanctuary cities,” [father Jim] Steinle said. “Well we never said that. What else are we going to get involved in?” Sullivan went on Greta Van Susteren’s TV show to praise Hispanic families who are in this country without documentation. Someone else asked Steinle if he thought such people working in the Central Valley should be deported, he scoffed. “If you deport them, what are you going to eat? Rocks?” he said. “I mean, they feed the United States.” “We just want to get this over with and move on with our lives, and think about Kate on our terms,” Steinle said following the verdict this week. “Nothing’s been on our terms. It’s been on everyone else’s terms.” ",2017-12-01 13:22:24,A seething Trump uses Steinle verdict to call for his border wall,"immigration and refugees,murders and attempted murders",115,http://www.dailykos.com
396,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1721711,"Update: The combined bill explained below passed the House this afternoon on a vote of 231-198. Six Democrats voted for it. Fourteen Republicans voted against it. The legislation now moves to the Senate where it most probably will face a filibuster unless Republicans can persuade eight Democrats to vote yes. •••   ••• Last week, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill which would force each state to recognize as valid permits from residents of other states to carry concealed, loaded firearms across state lines. This would apply even when the concealed-carry laws in those other states are much weaker. Republicans hope that by combining this bill with a bipartisan bill to improve the federal background-check system, they can collect enough votes to get both passed in the Senate. But some Democrats say combining the two will kill them both. The reciprocity bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, has 210 Republican and three Democratic co-sponsors, and is slated for a floor vote today. He said the combining of the two bills wasn’t his idea. Here’s The New York Times editorial board trashing Hudson’s bill: The measure fits well with the fantasies of vigilante justice peddled by President Trump in last year’s campaign and enthusiastically embraced by the N.R.A. Mr. Trump, who once favored strong gun controls, reduced the mass shooting epidemic to a Marvel comics scenario in which justice is done and deliverance achieved by heroic gunplay. “If I’m in that room, and let’s say we have two or five or 40 people with guns,” he hypothesized to voters, “we’re going to do a lot better because there’s going to be a shootout.” Genuine self-defense episodes, however, are scarce. Deaths caused by concealed-carry gun owners are not. Research shows that far from stopping mayhem, concealed-carry gun owners have been doing more harm to themselves, their family members and other innocent victims. Since May 2007, they have been responsible for at least 1,119 deaths not involving self-defense, including in 31 mass shootings and the killing of 21 law enforcement officers, according to the Violence Policy Center, a gun safety group. You can get a fuller picture about the dangers of the reciprocity bill here. The measure has been on the National Rifle Association’s wish list in some form for several years. But there is worse to come already in the pipeline. Back in 1986, soon after the gun lobby began its campaign to make it easier for Americans everywhere to carry concealed firearms, the majority of states issued permits for this purpose in very small numbers, if at all. Since then, all the states have made it at least somewhat easier to get a permit. So what’s worse than lots of permits? As you can see from the two maps below showing the situation in 1986 and now, another NRA campaign has been gaining ground—concealed carry without a permit. In 2001, only one state—Vermont—maintained this arrangement. Since colonial days, anybody in Vermont could carry concealed without getting permission, and unlike other states, it never tightened the law. Alaska became the second no-permit-needed state in 2003. Then, in 2013, the NRA began quietly working in the legislatures on this. Consequently, a dozen states do not now require concealed-carry permits. And while some state legislatures have rejected no-permit bills, or, as in Montana, passed bills that a Democratic governor has vetoed, the gun lobby is relentless. Thus, we can expect more states to join the parade over the next few years.  So, what happens when no-permit-needed meets reciprocity? Will residents of Missouri or Arizona, where no permit is required, be allowed to carry their hidden firearms in California where concealed permits in the mostly heavily populated counties are still issued parsimoniously? That’s the way critics interpret Hudson’s bill. This terrible legislation needs to be flat-lined by the Senate.

397,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1724288," Five years ago today, we heard there’d been a shooting at an elementary school in Connecticut. The names Sandy Hook and Newtown were not yet familiar, and as the first reports came out, few imagined how terrible the final toll would be. Twenty children and six members of the school staff were killed, and it felt earth-shattering. It felt like it would change things, give rise to a commitment to really fight mass shootings in America. As President Obama said that day, fighting to hold back tears, “As a country, we have been through this too many times.” Well, we know how that went. A few states have passed stronger gun laws, but at the national level, Republicans have not only blocked progress, they’ve pushed for weaker gun laws. In Orlando, 49 people were killed and 58 were injured in a mass shooting. In Las Vegas, 58 people were killed and more than 500 were injured in a mass shooting. Those deaths are not worth policy changes to Republicans, the same Republicans who scream for limits on immigration when an immigrant with a truck kills eight people. Like the man said, as a country, we’ve been through this too many times. We’ve seen too many pictures of the dead, of “beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old” or teachers or parents or newlyweds or nightclub-goers or country music fans; too many stories of families struggling with grief and fighting to make a difference; too many politicians offering up thoughts and prayers and telling us it’s the wrong time to talk about changing things. “Our hearts are broken today,” Obama said. They still are, and they will be again, because nothing has changed because Republicans will not let it change. So let’s remember Charlotte Bacon, age six; Daniel Barden, age seven; Rachel D’Avino, age 29; Olivia Engel, age six; Josephine Gay, age seven; Dylan Hockley, age six; Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, age 47; Madeline Hsu, age six; Catherine Hubbard, age six; Chase Kowalski, age seven; Jesse Lewis, age six; Ana Marquez-Greene, age six; James Mattioli, age six; Grace McDonnell, age seven; Anne Marie Murphy, age 52; Emilie Parker, age six; Jack Pinto, age six; Noah Pozner, age six; Caroline Previdi, age six; Jessica Rekos, age six; Avielle Richman, age six; Lauren Rousseau, age 30; Mary Sherlach, age 56; Victoria Soto, age 27; Benjamin Wheeler, age six; and Allison Wyatt, age six. They should all be five years older today. We cannot give up on preventing the mass shootings that will give us more lists of names to mourn.

398,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/republican-house-vote-concealed-carry-gun-background-checks/547454/?utm_source=feed,"GOP leaders want to pass a bill that would treat concealed-carry permits like driver’s or marriage licenses. But to do so, they’re tacking on a bipartisan bill to tighten up the federal background-check system. House Republicans plan to vote this week on a bipartisan proposal to tighten up the federal background-check system following the massacre last month of 25 Texas churchgoers by a man whose history of domestic violence should have stopped him from buying a gun. That vote would represent a breakthrough for advocates of gun control after years of congressional inaction in the wake of mass shootings—except for one enormous catch: Republicans are attaching the bipartisan bill to a separate measure that dramatically expands gun rights across the country. The second proposal, known as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, is a top priority of the National Rifle Association; it makes permits to carry a concealed weapon issued in one state valid in most other states as well. The bill would also allow people to carry concealed weapons into national parks and other federally-owned lands. Many states have strong background-check requirements or force applicants to undergo hours of gun-safety training before getting a concealed-carry permit. But many other states have weaker standards, and 12 states allow residents to carry handguns with no permit at all. “This will force states with strong laws to honor the requirements of the states with the weakest, and it’s really just not right,” Mark Kelly told reporters on a conference call. He’s the retired astronaut and husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who was shot at a constituent event in 2011. Democrats accused Republicans of using the modest bipartisan reform of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, as a legislative sweetener to win votes for a much more radical loosening of gun laws. The so-called Fix NICS Act adds a combination of incentives and penalties to ensure that state and federal agencies submit records to the background-check database. After last month’s church massacre in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the Air Force acknowledged that it failed to enter the shooter’s court martial for domestic violence into the NICS database, which could have prevented him from buying the rifle he used in the killing spree. “What we do in response to that horrific mass shooting should not be held hostage to the gun lobby’s No. 1 priority,” Kelly said. The Fix NICS Act also requires the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to report to Congress data on the use of bump stocks in gun crimes. That was the device used by the shooter who killed 58 people and injured hundreds more at a Las Vegas country-music concert in October. Democrats and some Republicans have called for an outright ban on bump stocks, which enable a gun to fire bullets at a much higher frequency, but the legislation does not go that far. The chief sponsor of the concealed-carry legislation is Representative Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina. In an interview on Monday, he told me it was not his decision to combine the two gun proposals into a single bill. He defended the reciprocity act as one that would force states to treat gun permits the same way as driver’s or marriage licenses. Hudson pointed out that while states would have to recognize permits issued by another, gun owners would still have to abide by each individual state’s laws on when and where they can carry a loaded weapon. He cited the example of Shaneen Allen, a single mother with a concealed-carry permit issued by Pennsylvania. In 2013, she spent 50 days in jail in New Jersey, which doesn’t have a reciprocity law, after she alerted police to her gun during a traffic stop. (Governor Chris Christie pardoned her.) “You’re not going to see mobs of people carrying concealed [weapons] into Times Square,” Hudson told me. “But,” he continued, “law-abiding citizens who may be passing through one state to get to grandma’s house in the next state aren’t automatically going to become a criminal.” A number of law-enforcement groups have come out against the bill, saying it would add to dangers faced by police officers on the beat. “This isn’t the Wild West,” said Kevin Davis, the Baltimore police commissioner. “The reality of it all is that police officers in Baltimore and elsewhere may be completely unable to confirm whether a person is indeed carrying legally.” A spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said an “overwhelming majority” of Democrats are expected to oppose the combined concealed-carry and background-check bill. Republicans might still be able to pass it on their own, but the bigger question will be the measure’s fate in the Senate, where at least eight Democratic votes would be needed to overcome a filibuster. Hudson’s office noted that seven Democrats currently serving in the Senate voted for a different concealed-carry reciprocity bill that was offered as an amendment in 2013. But Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the lead Democratic sponsor of the bipartisan Fix NICS bill, said he was confident that the GOP’s gambit wouldn’t work. “My impression is that if they combine the two, the bill is dead in the Senate,” Murphy told me. “So this is just theater this week in the House. This isn’t lawmaking.” Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican, told reporters last week that while he supported both bills, he didn’t think they should be combined. “Combining them, I think, is to risk doing nothing,” he said, according to the Daily Caller. Murphy did see a bit of a silver lining for advocates of stricter gun laws, however. “It is interesting to me that Republicans in the House decided they couldn’t move the concealed-carry reciprocity by itself and that for PR reasons they felt they had to dress it up with the Fix NICS Act,” he said. “That tells you that there’s a political exposure for Republicans on the NRA agenda that simply was not there 10 years ago.” By combining the bills, Republicans are trying to entice Democrats to support them, or risk looking overly political by opposing efforts to improve the background-check system that they’ve vocally backed. “It’s a pretty clumsy, transparent effort at trying to look reasonable,” Murphy said of the Republican maneuver. But that itself was a shift. In the past, he continued, “Republicans didn’t try to look reasonable.”",2017-12-05 09:26:38,A New Republican Strategy to Dramatically Expand Gun Rights,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,gun control,firearms",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
399,https://www.rawstory.com/2017/12/five-years-after-sandy-hook-us-gun-control-advocates-switch-strategy/,"Five years after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school, advocates who are disappointed with the failure of efforts to limit access to firearms are changing their strategy. Instead of pressuring lawmakers to push new gun-control measures through the U.S. Congress, volunteers from groups including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America are now running for office themselves. Nine of 13 volunteers trained by the group ran for office this year and won seats, ranging from New Hampshire state representative to city council member in West University Place, Texas. Fourteen more have already declared their intentions to run for office in 2018, seeking seats in Congress, state legislatures and local government, all running as Democrats. ""The reality is that the work doesn't really start in Congress. That's where it ends,"" said Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts, who launched her group the day after the Dec. 14, 2012, massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The group began training candidates after more than 400 of its 70,000 members said they were interested in running for office. ""This is a marathon, not a sprint,"" Watts said. ""It's going to take several election cycles."" Even if the next class of candidates, none of whom are running as Republicans, succeed in winning office, they will face an uphill battle against a U.S. Congress controlled by Republicans, who are staunch defenders of the right to bear arms protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Sandy Hook was at the time the second-deadliest mass shooting carried out by a single gunman in U.S. history. It sparked new energy among gun-control advocates who pushed for fresh federal restrictions on assault weapons, which were blocked by Republican lawmakers and the powerful National Rifle Association lobby. A steady stream of mass shootings have continued across the United States since Sandy Hook, including two deadlier incidents - the slaughter of 58 people at a Las Vegas concert in October and the massacre of 49 people at an Orlando gay nightclub last year. GRASSROOTS EFFORT Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was among the 20 first graders killed in Newtown, said he believes grass roots achievements like the new crop of gun-control candidates will lead to more action. ""This is a social change and it takes time,"" Barden said. ""What's happening in Congress notwithstanding, the change is going to come from the ground up."" In the meantime, Barden is working with Sandy Hook Promise, a volunteer effort to prevent more shooting deaths. The group said that in the past two years it has trained 2.5 million students and families to recognize signs of potential gun violence and report them to authorities. Social change, whether it is about drunk driving or recycling, comes from the ground up, said Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son Dylan died in the Sandy Hook attack. ""In the gun violence prevention movement, we have not focused on getting behavioral change. It's all been focused on top-down and that is not how you get change,"" she said. Next year's class of gun-control candidates includes a mother whose son was shot dead and a bystander paralyzed from the middle of her chest down in a drive-by shooting. Lara Kennedy is running for U.S. House of Representatives in the Texas district that encompasses Austin and north of San Antonio. Lucy McBath, whose only child Jordan Davis was shot dead after an argument over music while parked in Florida in 2012, is running for the Georgia House of Representatives. In Arizona, Jennifer Longdon, who was wounded in a random 2004 shooting, also is seeking to become a state representative. In Arkansas, Adrienne Kvello is challenging incumbent Republican state Representative Charlie Collins, who sponsored bills to put more guns on college campuses, in courthouses and the state capitol. Amber Gustafson, a gun-owning Moms Demand Action volunteer and life-long Republican who switched her party registration to Democrat last year, said if she wins her race for an Iowa state Senate seat, she will fight for gun safety laws aimed at preventing another Sandy Hook. ""I'm pro people defending their Second Amendment rights. But I also believe and know that good laws can really protect lives,"" Gustafson said.

The Eatonville Police Department (EPD) is terminating Corporal Omar Delgado, 45, just months shy of him becoming eligible for his pension thanks to his ongoing struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In six months, Delgado would reach his 10-year anniversary with the force and become vested in his pension. However, the EPD says it needs to hire a new officer right away for patrol duty, which Delgado can no longer perform after the night he spent in June of 2016 checking bodies in the dark club for signs of life and helping injured people to safety. ""The department is terminating Delgado from the force at the end of the month, Eatonville council members confirmed at a meeting late Tuesday,"" wrote Christal Hayes. ""His last day on his $38,500-a-year job is scheduled for Dec. 31."" She continued, ""An extra six months on the job would have allowed Delgado to receive 64% of his salary with benefits for life, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Since he will leave the force before making it to 10 years, he will receive 42% of his earnings, the paper noted."" Gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people and injured dozens of others on the night of June 12, 2016. Officer Delgado says that a year and a half later, he is tormented by the same nightmare each night. In it, he and fellow officers are struggling to help injured people escape from the club when Mateen begins to shoot again. Delgado and the officers around him dive for the ground, unable to tell where the shots are coming from or at whom they're being fired. He wakes up screaming, he said, in a cold sweat. “I never thought I would have gotten to this point. I thought I’d shake it off and everything would be fine,” he told USA Today. “But that hasn’t happened. Nothing has been right since that day.” Delgado says he doesn't understand the department's decision to terminate him without his full benefits. ""Just let me get vested and I will be more than happy to pack up my troubles and leave,” he said. “This is the thing I’ve been working toward for 10 years and to be six months shy then be fired, it’s like ‘wow!’” One of the people Delgado saved on the night of the mass shooting was Angel Colon, who had been shot six times. “He was my hero. He saved my life and for them to just do what they’re doing to him in front of my face is a slap to my face as well,” said Colon to WFTV, a local ABC affiliate. “He did his job that night on June 12 so they should have his back 100% totally and just be there for whatever he needs.” Read the full report here.

401,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/thinking-about-guns-five-years-after-newtown,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Adam Gopnik The Republican-controlled House of Representatives observed the fifth
anniversary of the child massacre through gun violence, in Newtown,
Connecticut, by passing a bill enabling more gun violence. The Concealed
Carry Reciprocity Act, which passed on December 6th, still has to get
through the Senate, but it would essentially make “concealed carry” laws
uniform across the country—so that someone who has the right to walk
around with a gun under his coat in Florida could do so in other places,
like, say, New York City, where packing under your coat is less widely
praised. The logic of concealed carry is that a person with a hidden gun
will stand ready to defend himself—or to kill someone shooting others,
in a sort of Clint Eastwood-movie moment. This is a fantasy, since, as
the social scientist David Hemenway, an expert on gun violence who teaches at the
Harvard School of Public Health, points out, these much embellished acts
of self-defense, if they happen at all, are “incredibly rare.” Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress have renewed an effort to at least
allow gun violence to become an object of scientific study. It is hard
to believe, but, owing to a twenty-year-old measure, which was passed by
another Republican-controlled Congress, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention is not allowed to investigate the causes and the effects
of gun violence, even though it costs more lives in America than in any
other developed country. Taken together, these elements—the desperate desire to own and carry
guns, the equally desperate desire to blind oneself to the causes of gun
violence—reveal, to any detached or anthropological eye, the essentially
symbolic and fetishistic nature of the American gun obsession. This
obsession long ago lost any connection to the reasonable arguments for
gun ownership—hunting for food or sport, or rural pest control.
Meanwhile, the victims of gun violence suffer. In the case of the Sandy
Hook Elementary School shooting, in Newtown, it is impossible for anyone
who has not felt the scale and the intensity of the grief that follows
the loss of a child to understand it. We are moved as we watch parents
take measures to try to reduce the chances of another parent having to
endure what they have; some of the families of the Sandy Hook victims
are still fighting for a legal case against the manufacturer of the AR-15, the gun used in the massacre. But we also ought to be enraged. This year, we have clearly reached a
breaking point—it would be too cosmetic to call it a tipping point—in
our reactions to gun violence. We witnessed, in Las Vegas, the worst
mass shooting in this country’s recent history—an utterly unimaginable
and chilling scene in which a faceless gunman armed with semiautomatic
weapons modified with bump stocks mowed down helpless concertgoers,
demonstrating the absurdity of the notion that there is some kind of
effective distinction between automatic and semiautomatic weapons. In a
sane country, gun massacres would be followed by new laws, as happened
in Australia. There, after the 1996 Port Arthur shooting, in which
thirty-five people died, the government passed the National Firearms
Agreement, which outlawed automatic and semiautomatic rifles. In this
country, the Las Vegas massacre was followed, just two months later, by
the conceal-carry bill. The Las Vegas massacre has
already—astonishingly, given its extraordinary lethality—been largely
removed from our minds. It is unlikely to be the first or the second or
even the third thing recalled about this year’s events; it’s almost
become the subject of instant amnesia. Forgetting surely has its place
in healthy democracies—loss can be crippling, too, as New Yorkers
learned after 9/11—but this much forgetting this fast is
becoming pathological. People will say on this anniversary —and this is the one rational
riposte to those of us who are concerned about guns as a central
American concern—that gun massacres, though they get the largest share
of attention, are not the chief or even the major problem of guns in
America. Gun violence involves suicide; gun violence involves gang
violence; gun violence involves domestic violence. And, therefore, the
single-minded obsession with gun control and mass shootings is in itself
a sort of fetishistic folly. That’s not an unreasonable argument, if you
just break down the numbers. What it ignores, however, is the climate of
paranoia that is created nationwide by the persistence of gun massacres.
We now live in a country and a culture in which grade-school children
are routinely drilled about what to do in the presence of a psychotic
gunman. Hospitals post notices on their walls outlining procedures;
colleges have regular drills and rehearsals about what to do if a
shooter suddenly appears on campus. We know about “lockdowns” the way an
earlier generation knew about “duck and cover,” in case of a nuclear
attack. Such rituals, now as then, speak to some deep neurosis set loose
in the society, an attempt to use the marginal analgesics to deal with a
major crisis. Atomic warfare can’t be cured by ducking and covering; gun
violence can’t be alleviated by lone-shooter drills. In that sense, the
prevalence of gun massacres is one that we pay a social cost for every
day, even if we, or if anyone we know, is never the victim of them. All these measures inevitably contribute to a climate of fear that harms
our capacity to feel the confidence and the optimism in our daily
interactions that is at the core of a liberal society. Adam Smith—to
cite a hero of libertarians who are generally hostile to gun
control—believed that the central point about liberal societies is that
they rely on trust: they rely on the ability of people to interact with
one another without fearing, for example, that the guy sitting across
from you is carrying a concealed murder weapon. Making concealed carry a
national “right” will help produce a permanently paranoid society. The
bill isn’t just a pointless response to violence; it is, in itself, a
psychological symptom of the breakdown of the open society. Meanwhile,
we wait for the next gun massacre, which is coming as surely as
Christmas, and the next wave of willful amnesia, after it. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

402,https://www.rawstory.com/2017/12/south-carolina-capital-poised-to-be-first-us-city-to-ban-gun-bump-stocks/,"South Carolina's capital on Tuesday could become the first U.S. city to ban the use of bump stocks, a gun accessory that has drawn national scrutiny after being found among the Las Vegas mass shooter's arsenal of weapons in October. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin said the city council was expected in a vote on Tuesday night to approve an ordinance barring the devices, which allow semiautomatic rifles to fire hundreds of rounds a minute like fully automatic machine guns. ""One of the common refrains that you hear whether it was in Texas or Vegas or Sandy Hook is that a good guy with a gun could have stopped the carnage,"" Benjamin, a Democrat, said in a phone interview on Monday. ""It's time for the good guys with guns to begin to pass some really good policy."" Authorities said Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock had 12 rifles outfitted with bump stocks in the hotel room where he launched his attack on an outdoor concert, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Since the shooting, several states and cities have proposedmeasures outlawing or restricting the attachments, and the U.S. Justice Department said earlier this month it was considering a ban on certain bump stocks. California and New York already ban them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five other states prohibit devices that allow automatic fire, and seven states and the District of Columbia have assault weapons bans that could include bump stocks, the organization said. ""We are not aware of any cities that have passed ordinancesbanning bump stocks,"" said Tom Martin, a spokesman for the National League of Cities in Washington. In Columbia, four of the council's six members approved the city's proposed ordinance on a first reading earlier this month. The measure also would ban the use of other gun attachments that allow rifles to fire faster. Owners would be required to keep them stored separately from any weapon. Trigger-enhancing devices are not gun parts, gun components, weapons or ammunition, which state law prohibits cities from regulating, Benjamin said. The mayor, who has a background in law enforcement and said he owns guns, said the measure had drawn support from local police and council members who support the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protecting gun ownership rights.

After two years of unsettling increases, America’s crime and murder rates may have declined in 2017. A new report by the Brennan Center for Justice looked at crime and murder rates in the 30 largest US cities, updating figures from another report released in September with more data for the rest of the year. Over the past two years, Brennan had found increases — sometimes sharp rises — in the violent crime and murder rates. Many feared this was a reversal from the past several decades of crime decreases, which put the 2014 US murder rate in particular at the lowest it’s been since at least the 1960s. So it’s good news that the opposite seems to be true this year. According to Brennan’s estimates, the overall crime rate fell by 2.7 percent, the violent crime rate dropped by 1.1 percent, and the murder rate declined by 5.6 percent in 2017. “Large decreases this year in Chicago and Detroit, as well as small decreases in other cities, contributed to this decline,” Brennan found. “The murder rate in Chicago — which increased significantly in 2015 and 2016 — is projected to decline by 11.9 percent in 2017. It remains 62.4 percent above 2014 levels. The murder rate in Detroit is estimated to fall by 9.8 percent. New York City’s murder rate will also decline again, to 3.3 killings per 100,000 people.” As the report notes, some cities’ murder rates, even after overall decreases this year, will still be above numbers from a couple years ago — which, according to Brennan, shows “a need for evidence-based solutions to violent crime in these areas.” (For more on what works to combat crime and violence, read Vox’s explainer.) One caveat: These are preliminary figures, based on data from 29 of the 30 largest cities (Phoenix didn’t provide 2017 statistics to Brennan). The full official numbers for the entire US, compiled by the FBI, will come out later next year. Generally, however, Brennan’s reports have done a good job predicting overall national trends in the past few years. And the news, overall, is good. The past two years’ increases in the murder rate got a lot of attention, with President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions often bringing them up in speeches to justify “tough on crime” policies. But before they’ve been able to implement such policies and let them take root, especially in local and state jurisdictions where federal policymakers have very limited power, these rates appear to be coming down. Criminologists still aren’t sure why murder in particular appeared to spike so much in 2015 and 2016. Some argued that there might have been a “Ferguson effect,” named after the city that exploded into protests over the police shooting of Michael Brown: Due to protests against police brutality over the past few years, police were, the theory goes, scared off from doing proactive policing, emboldening criminals. Other experts argued a different kind of Ferguson effect: The demonstrations over police led to elevated distrust in law enforcement, which makes it much harder for police to solve and prevent crimes. Yet many criminologists cautioned that it’s also possible that the two years’ increases were blips in the data. This isn’t unprecedented; in 2005 and 2006, the murder rate in the US increased before continuing its long-term decline — to new record lows — in the ensuing years. Since the murder rate in particular is generally low, it’s prone to large statistical fluctuations. As one example, New Orleans–based crime analyst Jeff Asher previously told me that he expected the 2016 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in which 50 died, to lead to a massive increase in the murder rate in the city, even though it was just one particularly horrific event. That’s why criminologists generally demand several years of data before they declare a significant crime trend. It now looks possible — though we’ll need more years of data to confirm — that 2015 and 2016 were replays of 2005 and 2006. If that holds, then perhaps the US isn’t in the middle of the “American carnage” that Trump warned about. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

In 2016, Tennessee’s (mostly white) state legislature passed the Heritage Protection Act to protect monuments of historical figures — with a goal of stopping cities from taking down Confederate statues. This week, Memphis took down two Confederate statues anyway — after lawmakers in the (mostly black) city found a creative workaround. The state law prohibits the removal, relocation, alteration, or renaming of “[a]ny statue, monument, memorial, bust, nameplate, plaque, artwork, flag, historic display, school, street, bridge, or building … on public property,” including those that honor figures from past US military conflicts, without a waiver from the Tennessee Historical Commission. The commission in October rejected Memphis’s request for a waiver. But Memphis City Council members found a loophole: What if the property wasn’t public anymore? So the city on Wednesday agreed to sell two parks to a nonprofit, Memphis Greenspace Inc., which is run by Shelby County Commissioner and attorney Van Turner. Shortly thereafter, Greenspace took down two Confederate monuments at the parks — of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest (who was also a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan) — to chants of, “Na na na na / Na na na na / Hey hey hey / Goodbye!” The sale will almost certainly be challenged in court. And the Tennessee House has already called for an investigation. But for now, the statues have been relocated to an undisclosed location (for security reasons). This is just the latest phase in America’s ongoing battle over Confederate symbols and monuments. The current debate goes back to a mass shooting in 2015, when a self-described white supremacist shot and killed nine people in a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina. He drew a lot of attention for posing with the Confederate flag in images that came out after the shooting — and that helped spur a fight within South Carolina about whether it should take down a Confederate flag that had flown at the state capitol for years. The state eventually agreed to officially take down the flag (after it was unofficially taken down by activist Bree Newsome). Since then, many cities and states, particularly in the South, have been questioning their own Confederate symbols. The argument is simple: The Confederacy fought to maintain slavery and white supremacy in the United States, and that isn’t something the country should honor or commemorate in any way. But as conservative forces resist the shift, some activists, including in governments, are taking matters into their own hands — sometimes with creative solutions. That’s what we saw in Memphis this week. For more on the battle over Confederate statues, read Vox’s explainer. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

405,https://www.rawstory.com/2017/12/new-mexico-school-gunman-was-ex-student-investigated-by-fbi/,"A gunman who killed two students at a New Mexico high school and then took his own life was a former student who was investigated by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation last year after he asked online about buying weapons for a mass shooting, officials said on Friday. Authorities identified the shooter in Thursday's attack as 21-year-old William Atchison, who worked at a gas station in Aztec, New Mexico, and was an enthusiast of active shooter gaming websites. ""He was a single coward shooter,"" San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen said at a news conference by law enforcement. ""It's important to understand how focused he was, how deranged he was, in his intent."" The shooting occurred shortly after 8 a.m. on Thursday at the high school in Aztec, a town of 6,000 people about 200 miles (320 km) northwest of Santa Fe and 20 miles (32 km) from the Navajo Nation reservation. Atchison disguised himself as a student, entered the school as students got off buses, and was in a bathroom preparing for the shooting when Francisco Fernandez, a pupil at the school known for his computer skills, entered the restroom, officials said. Atchison shot Fernandez, then exited the bathroom and shot cheerleader Casey Jordan-Marquez in the hallway, said New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas. Atchison fired randomly in the hallway before entering a computer lab and firing through a wall at students barricaded inside a closet, Kassetas said. Atchison likely shot himself shortly afterwards as police entered the school, he added. Police found a thumb drive on Atchison's body that contained a Dec. 7 message indicating he was unhappy with work and life, and he planned to attack a school. ""If things go according to plan, today would be when I die,"" the message read. In March 2016, Atchison was interviewed by the FBI, which had acted on a tip about a comment he made on an online gaming site. ""If you're going to conduct a mass shooting does anyone know about cheap assault rifles?"" FBI special agent Terry Wade said Atchison asked. The FBI closed its investigation after determining no crime was committed, Wade said. Atchison did not have any weapons when the FBI interviewed him, officials said. He purchased the 9mm pistol he used in the shooting locally and legally last month, officials said.

406,https://www.rawstory.com/2017/12/new-documentary-reveals-major-coverup-and-corruption-in-las-vegas-police-department-before-and-after-the-mass-shooting/,"Unanswered questions still surround the mass shooting in Las Vegas on October 1 this year. Days after shooter Stephen Paddock killed 59 people and injured over 500, confusing details emerged. Journalists sparred with police at press conferences, grappling for missing details. The security guard who discovered Paddock in his hotel room with 24 guns and was shot by Paddock later disappeared, only to reemerge as a guest on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. To shed light on this confusion, a new film, “What Happened in Vegas,” explores the role of the Las Vegas Police Department after the mass shooting. In short, there’s plenty of evidence to suggest coverups and corruption, as well as repeated police brutality within the force. At the root of the problem, the film explains, is that the LVPD is run by a sheriff elected in large part by donations from MGM, the corporation that runs the Mandalay Bay hotel. According to the documentary, Las Vegas police changed their story multiple times on the timeline of the shooting. One important detail the police lied about in several instances is the timing of Paddock’s shooting of security guard Jesus Campos. Why? It’s likely that the LVPD wanted to help the casino’s legal case, and if they claimed Campos was killed while trying to prevent Paddock’s rampage, as opposed to during or after, it could help the casino's lawyers later claim that the Mandalay Bay had taken sufficient action to stop him. At least seven news organizations have since sued the LVPD for failing to release all the information from the night of the shooting, including the New York Times, the Associated Press, ABC, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. The documentary also suggests that if the police and casino had acted differently, the mass shooting might have been avoided. An exclusive clip, below, reveals a little-known piece of the story of what happened in Las Vegas earlier this year. As Stephen Stubbs, an attorney working on behalf of the victims, explains, casinos like the Mandalay Bay have a “special back number” to a private wing of the police department which they use to alert the police of possible criminal activity within their casinos involving high rollers. Paddock was a regular at the casino, and known to be a highroller by the hotel’s staff, so the Mandalay Bay didn’t call 911 when Paddock shot Campos. They called the back line instead, and the operator didn’t link the shooting of Campos to the cascade of bullets pouring out of Paddock's hotel window onto the Route 91 music festival. “If they would’ve called 911, the 911 operator could have linked the two quicker, and the police would have gotten there quicker,"" Stubbs said. ""Less people would have died, and less people would have been shot, if the Mandalay Bay didn’t treat their high rollers differently, and if the LVPD didn’t allow casinos to treat high rollers differently. This is the truth that [Sheriff] Joe Lombardo doesn’t want to come out.”  As for the still unanswered question of why Paddock chose to murder so many people that day, Stubbs has a theory. “From what I understand, Stephen Paddock did this because he wanted to hurt these casinos financially, and this was the best way he knew how.” But culpability still points to the corrupt special relationship between the MGM and the Las Vegas Police Department. “It didn’t have to be this bad, if they would have treated him like anyone else.” In addition, the documentary explores numerous instances of police misconduct and several incidents in which police needlessly shot and killed suspects. There’s the story of Trevon Cole, who had been selling small amounts of marijuana on the side and whose wife was several months pregnant when he was shot and killed by a police officer. The police secured a warrant for his arrest (in reality, they lied to the judge and provided evidence against an entirely different man named Trevon Cole), and an officer went to his apartment and shot him in the head. When the LVPD was criticized for Cole’s death, they launched a smear campaign that tried to promote a false image of Cole as a dangerous drug dealer. It’s a tactic the Las Vegas police often resort to, the documentary suggests. “Often a dead person is vilified, and they release negative details to the media,” says the father of one victim of police violence. “They tried to turn my son into some kind of a druggie. Erik was a West Point graduate... he was a very effective, popular platoon leader."" Of the high-profile police shootings in Las Vegas in recent years, the Cole family’s attorney Andre Lagomarsino says, “all three situations could have been avoided if the LVPD de-escalated the situations, instead of escalating them.” The entire documentary is available for viewing online.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Investigators continue to search for Stephen Paddock's motive; Trace Gallagher reports from Los Angeles. The girlfriend of the Las Vegas shooter told authorities that they would likely find her fingerprints on some of Stephen Paddock’s bullets because she sometimes assisted him in loading ammunition into magazines, court documents unsealed on Friday revealed. There was no evidence at that time of ""criminal involvement"" by Marilou Danley, an Oct. 3 document showed, but it noted that investigators had not ruled out the possibility. Officials also reportedly sought the email, Facebook and Instagram accounts of Danley, who was in the Philippines during the Oct. 1 shooting. Paddock fatally shot himself after firing from a Las Vegas Strip hotel room into a concert crowd, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds. New information about the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting carried out by Stephen Paddock was unveiled on Friday.
      (AP) Also unveiled on Friday: Emails Paddock had exchanged about buying rifles and bump stocks months before he carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Paddock reportedly used guns equipped with the device, which allows semi-automatic weapons to fire almost as quickly as automatic ones. The documents said Paddock had received an email from a Gmail account in July encouraging him to try an AR-style rifle before buying one. ""We have huge selection"" in the Las Vegas area, the email allegedly noted. Paddock wrote back that he wanted to try several scopes and different types of ammunition. An email in response suggested trying a bump stock on the rifle with a 100-round magazine. Paddock's email address and the Gmail address had similar names, leading investigators to suspect that he may have been emailing himself, although they couldn't figure out why. FBI agents reportedly knew that Paddock had left behind big caches of guns, ammunition and explosives when they sought warrants to search his properties and online accounts, according to the documents. Las Vegas Police Officer Aden Ocampo Gomez and FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault said Friday that they had no update about Paddock's motive. Both called it an ongoing investigation. A Nevada judge will hear arguments on Tuesday about whether Las Vegas police search warrant documents should remain sealed. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

          / CBS NEWS Since 1927, Time magazine has named a Person of the Year, a living symbol of the year that was. The title is not necessarily considered an honor or award; instead, Time has described its picks in terms of influence and importance. Here's every Time Person of the Year for the past quarter of a century. ""History may eventually decide that the key to Clinton's accomplishment lay in his temperament ... in his enthusiasm for people and curiosity about their lives,"" Time said of the then-president-elect. Two pairs of men shared the title in 1993 under the label ""The Peacemakers."" F. W. de Klerk, as the president of South Africa, worked to secure Nelson Mandela's release from prison. The two worked together to end the system of racial apartheid in South Africa. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accord, the first face-to-face agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The first non-Italian pope in nearly 500 years, John Paul II was known for his modernization of the papacy and his extensive foreign reach. ""His power rests in the word, not the sword,"" Time said in 1994. Citing his role in ending 40 years of Democratic Party domination in the House, Time named Newt Gingrich Man of the Year in 1995. ""Gingrich has changed the center of gravity,"" Time said. AIDS researcher David Ho made huge contributions to understanding and treating HIV. ""He's kind of a genius, you know,"" his mother told Time. ""I'm not supposed to say that, but it's true."" Intel co-founder Andrew Grove changed the way tech affects everyday Americans through his extensive work with semiconductors. Time called Grove ""the person most responsible for the amazing growth in the power and innovative potential of microchips."" Bill Clinton was once again named Time's Person of the Year in 1998, but this time, he shared the billing with Ken Starr, the special counsel investigating him for perjury during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Starr's investigation led to impeachment proceedings against Clinton. ""For rewriting the book on crime and punishment, for putting prices on values we didn't want to rank, for fighting past all reason a battle whose casualties will be counted for years to come, Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr are Time's 1998 Men of the Year,"" Time said. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos ""is a person who not only changed the way we do things but helped pave the way for the future,"" Time said. George W. Bush was named Time's Person of the Year after the closest presidential election in the nation's history. ""Bush campaigned for a year against partisan politics and that was before partisanship became so poisonous that it polluted every institution of government. The man who talked less about what he would do than how he would do it finds that his bet has been called,"" Time said. Rudy Giuliani was the mayor of New York during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ""When the day of infamy came, Giuliani seized it as if he had been waiting for it all his life, taking on half a dozen critical roles and performing each masterfully,"" Time said. Coleen Rowley, Cynthia Cooper and Sherron Watkins were singled out by Time ""for believing — really believing — that the truth is one thing that must not be moved off the books, and for stepping in to make sure that it wasn't."" Rowley called out the FBI for ignoring early signs of a plan to attack the United States on 9/11. Auditor Cooper dug up $3.8 billion in accounting irregularities at Worldcom, forcing the company into bankruptcy. And Watkins warned her bosses at Enron that the company was in danger of collapse, which it did. Time's decision came nine months into the Iraq War in 2003. ""For uncommon skills and service, for the choices each one of them has made and the ones still ahead, for the challenge of defending not only our freedoms but those barely stirring half a world away, the American soldier is Time's Person of the Year,"" the article said. George W. Bush was named Time's Person of the Year for a second time in 2004, after winning reelection during the Iraq War. Bush was chosen ""for sticking to his guns (literally and figuratively),"" Time wrote, ""for reshaping the rules of politics to fit his ten-gallon-hat leadership style and for persuading a majority of voters that he deserved to be in the White House for another four years."" The good works of Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Bono earned the trio acclaim in 2005. Bono, U2's frontman and a philanthropist, organized concerts to benefit impoverished nations. Bill and Melinda Gates founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and pledged a huge portion of their wealth. Time called the them ""three people on a global mission to end poverty, disease -- and indifference."" An explosion of individual content creators on the internet spurred Time's unusual 2006 decision. ""It's about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes,"" Time said. Putin landed on Time's cover in the final year of his first term as Russia's president. ""If Russia fails, all bets are off for the 21st century. And if Russia succeeds as a nation-state in the family of nations, it will owe much of that success to one man, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,"" the Time article said. ""He hit the American scene like a thunderclap, upended our politics, shattered decades of conventional wisdom and overcame centuries of the social pecking order,"" the article said of the then-president-elect. ""He didn't just reshape U.S. monetary policy,"" Time said of the Federal Reserve chair in 2009, a year after the devastating worldwide financial crisis. ""He led an effort to save the world economy. No wonder his eyes look tired."" ""In less than seven years,"" Time said of the Facebook founder, ""Zuckerberg wired together a twelfth of humanity into a single network, thereby creating a social entity almost twice as large as the U.S. ""We have entered the Facebook age, and Mark Zuckerberg is the man who brought us here."" The Arab Spring and the Occupy movement jointly inspired Time's decision in 2011. ""In 2011, protesters didn't just voice their complaints; they changed the world,"" said the Time article. After defeating Mitt Romney to win his second term as president, Obama once again found himself named Person of the Year. ""He will take the oath on Jan. 20 as the first Democrat in more than 75 years to get a majority of the popular vote twice. Only five other Presidents have done that in all of U.S. history,"" Time noted. Time's 2013 choice had just been elevated to lead the Roman Catholic Church. ""John Paul II and Benedict XVI were professors of theology,"" Time noted. ""Francis is a former janitor, nightclub bouncer, chemical technician and literature teacher."" Health care workers, scientists, nurses, ambulance attendees and others who fought the devastating Ebola virus outbreak shared the title in 2014. Five Time covers featured Dr. Jerry Brown, a medical director in Monrovia, Liberia; Dr. Kent Brantly, the first American to be infected in the 2014 Ebola outbreak; Ella Watson-Stryker, a health promoter for Doctors Without Borders; Foday Gallah, an ambulance supervisor and Ebola survivor from Monrovia; and Salome Karwah, a trainee nurse from Liberia whose parents died of Ebola. The German chancellor got the nod from Time after playing a huge role in managing the Greek debt emergency and the European migrant crisis. As president-elect, Donald Trump was named Time's Person of the Year in 2016. The magazine explained: ""For reminding America that demagoguery feeds on despair and that truth is only as powerful as the trust in those who speak it, for empowering a hidden electorate by mainstreaming its furies and live-streaming its fears, and for framing tomorrow's political culture by demolishing yesterday's, Donald Trump is Time 2016 Person of the Year."" The ""silence breakers"" who ignited the anti-harassment #MeToo movement were named Time's Person of the Year in 2017. In the wake of sexual harassment and assault allegations made against Harvey Weinstein and other prominent men, millions of people shared stories of abuse as Hollywood, Congress, American businesses and universities reckoned with their responsibilities. The cover featured farm worker Isabel Pascual, lobbyist Adama Iwu, actress Ashley Judd, software engineer Susan Fowler, musician Taylor Swift and a hospital worker who chose to remain anonymous. In 2018, the magazine named ""the guardians"" as Time's Person of the Year. All are journalists who were violently attacked or slapped with criminal charges in an apparent effort to silence the free press worldwide. The magazine produced different cover images. One features Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi consulate in Turkey. An alternate cover features the wives of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo holding their pictures; the journalists have been imprisoned since December 2017 in Myanmar after reporting on a massacre of Rohingya Muslims. Others singled out by the magazine are Maria Ressa — a journalist and CEO of a news site in the Philippines — and the staff of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Maryland, where five journalists were killed in a mass shooting in June. In 2019, Time chose 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg as the Person of the Year. Thunberg made a splash in 2019 leading protests around the world, speaking at the U.N., meeting with the Pope, and sparring with the president of the United States on Twitter. President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala are the first running mates to be chosen together as Time's Person of the Year. Time editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal writes that they were selected for their roles in ""changing the American story, for showing that the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division, for sharing a vision of healing in a grieving world.""
