2,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/02/i-like-bernie-sanders-his-supporters-not-so-much-berniebro,"The ‘Berniebro’ phenomenon has left me feeling, well, Berned-out Last modified on Wed 26 Feb 2020 18.02 GMT I’m not #FeelingTheBern anymore. I’m on Bernie Sanders’ side policy-wise. I agree with many more of his positions than I do Hillary Clinton’s. I donated money to his campaign last year and I intend to vote for him in the Ohio primary in March. Still, the “Berniebro” phenomenon has left me feeling, well, Berned-out. I am referring to a certain demographic of Sanders supporter – white and male – who accuses anyone who’s not #FeelingTheBern of being a member of the “Establishment.”  It’s gotten bad enough that Bernie Sanders’ campaign rapid response director had to speak up about it on Twitter. It’s gotten bad enough that, among my circle of friends (who are mostly millennials about evenly split between supporting Clinton and Sanders in the primary), the “Berniebro” phenomenon immediately comes up whenever the election comes up. It’s not a new pattern. Remember the Obamatons back in 2008, who declared Hillary Clinton to be everything from a reincarnated Margaret Thatcher to Ronald Reagan in a pantsuit – despite the fact that Clinton had a near identical voting record to Obama’s and actually ran to his left on issues like healthcare. The worst trait of fundamentalists is their insistence that anyone who’s not on board with their revolution is part of a coordinated conspiracy to silence and suppress that revolution. You can watch in real time as any progressive public figure who refuses to openly endorse Sanders – whether or not they also endorse Clinton – gets bombarded by wave after wave of accusations of being on the take. Their hypocrisy, too, is distasteful. When black activists were singled out at a political rally for being “potentially disruptive”, many Bernie supporters were silent. And when detractors criticize Bernie about his record on gun control, or the fact that his healthcare agenda, unlike Clinton’s, never directly addresses reproductive rights, those people are often accused of being disingenuous shills using “identity politics” to enact the agenda of the big banks. If people find it off-putting or troubling that Sanders seems persistently unwilling to pivot away from his one-plank platform of attacking income inequality to talk about any other issue – be it police violence against black Americans or violence by Daesh overseas – they’re No True Leftists, because it’s self-evident to any true leftist that all issues should come back to economics. Hell, even when the Sanders campaign does something unambiguously and unarguably bad, like when one of their staffers gets caught accessing Clinton campaign data and is summarily fired for it, you hear Sanders people grumbling about how that staffer came from the Democratic National Convention and may possibly have been a plant. It’s a problem when a movement cannot accept criticism or dissenting views. When Sarah Jeong, a journalist and Bernie Sanders supporter, said she saw racist comments on Twitter linked to a #FeelTheBern account, a mob of trolls tried to chase her off the internet. Another woman, who said she personally likes and identifies with Hillary Clinton, was sent death threats. These are not isolated cases. The worst part is that I don’t think it is entirely confined to jerks on the internet – it’s been percolating its way up through the campaign, and has now even tinged the rhetoric of the candidate himself. Consider that Bernie Sanders called Planned Parenthood “The Establishment,” despite being primarily an organization that provides healthcare for the poor. That was after the group had been on the ropes for months from vicious, false attacks that culminated in a mass shooting last year. But when you’re fighting a “political revolution” and the entire atmosphere of your campaign is dripping with revolutionary zeal, then pretty quickly anyone who’s not with you is against you. It’s disappointing that Planned Parenthood’s choice to endorse Clinton over Sanders was a reason for Sanders to dismiss Planned Parenthood as yet another adversary to “take on”. What I’ve liked about Sanders as a person and a candidate so far has been that he’s better than his fans. In his time in the Senate he has done the hard work of making things happen within the existing system rather than piously opining on how the system is corrupt. He also started this campaign with a no-mudslinging pledge and the intention of improving the Democratic party rather than merely proving himself separate from and superior to it. I like the Bernie Sanders who, after his tiff with #BlackLivesMatter, went and listened to their concerns, listened to Sandra Bland’s family and #SaidHerName. I don’t like the version of him that reared his head when they first confronted him at Netroots Nation and in Seattle, storming out as though he’d been wronged. Many of Sanders’ supporters are young, impatient college graduates who love to see someone with a clear-cut set of beliefs running roughshod over the triangulating phonies. But if you’re one of the people being run roughshod over, and you feel you have legitimate concerns that don’t fit into that ideological model of progressivism, the revolution is a lot less appealing. Democratic politics does not work if you just talk and never shut up and listen. And right now the Sanders campaign isn’t doing that great a job at listening.",2016-02-02 10:17:16,I like Bernie Sanders. His supporters?

3,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/wPzq0MmDFto/,"For many in American Muslims, President Obama’s visit to a mosque Thursday has been a long time coming. In the final year of his presidency and at a time when anti-Islamic sentiment seems to have reached new heights, Obama will sit down with members of the Muslim community in Maryland for an open discussion. The President will visit the Islamic Society of Baltimore on Wednesday, marking his first trip to a mosque as President. At the mosque and sprawling community center, located about 45 miles outside Washington in Baltimore County, the President will “affirm our conviction in the principle of religious liberty,” according to White House spokesman Josh Earnest. “Law-abiding Americans should be able to worship God in the way that they see fit, consistent with their religious heritage and traditions in a way that doesn’t subject them to either interference from the government or, frankly, divisive rhetoric on the campaign trail,” Earnest said Tuesday. The proliferation of terrorists from ISIS, the attacks in Paris and the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., have left the world on edge. That anxiety has led to fear and, in some cases, hatred and violence directed toward the Muslim community. “We’ve seen threats all over the country to mosques, we’ve seen shooting at mosques, vandalism threats and assaults targeting Muslims nationwide,” Ibrahim Hooper, a national spokesperson for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told TIME in December. Read More: What It’s Like to Be Muslim in America Post-Paris When Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. and other GOP candidates introduced proposals to either limit or halt the admission of refugees from majority-Muslim countries and Syria, Obama very quickly found himself having to repeatedly defend the protection of refugees and the right of Muslims to worship freely in America. “Just as it is the responsibility of Muslims around the world to root out misguided ideas that lead to radicalization, it is the responsibility of all Americans — of every faith — to reject discrimination,” Obama said in his Oval Office address to the nation on the strategy against ISIS. During remarks at a naturalization ceremony in Washington, the President said all Americans “must resolve to always speak out against hatred and bigotry in all of its forms — whether taunts against the child of an immigrant farmworker or threats against a Muslim shopkeeper.” And in his 2016 State of the Union address, the President said Americans have a responsibility to “reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn’t a matter of political correctness. It’s a matter of understanding what makes us strong.” The President will have an opportunity to relay that message to community members directly on Wednesday when he meets with about a dozen leaders before his public remarks. He’ll seek to reinforce, too, that his Administration doesn’t simply consider Muslim Americans through a national-security lens, but through the important role the community plays in American society. He’ll also have an opportunity to hear directly from leaders in the community about what issues are impacting them and what their concerns are. Given the political climate today, and the reports that anti-Muslim activity is on the rise across the U.S., there’s likely a lot on Muslims’ minds. In fact, the Islamic Society of Baltimore, where Obama will visit, was the subject of threats last year. In May, CBS Baltimore reported someone called the mosque and threatened to “spill Muslim blood.” Zainab Chaudry, the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ outreach manager in Maryland, says a building on the property of another mosque nearby was firebombed last fall. Though Chaudry says the firebombing is not believed to have been a hate crime, it all contributes to the fear and uncertainty felt by many Muslims in that community. “I’ve had many parents call me and tell me that they’re scared for their children’s safety when they are in school or away from them because they don’t know what kind of incidents they’re going to be subjected to,” Chaudry says. The roundtable could also provide leaders within the Muslim community to express their concern about the federal government’s initiatives on countering violent extremism. Advocates within the Muslim community have said the initiatives target them, and Chaudry says she is hopeful the opportunity will arise to discuss this and other policies that alienate segments of the Muslim community. “They may be well intentioned, but the way that they are framed in some cases helps to reinforce that sense of fear towards Muslims and Islam,” she says. Overall, Chaudry tells TIME that members of the community are looking forward to an opportunity to engage with the President and hopefully send a broader message to those spewing hateful rhetoric. “This election has been one of most, if not the most, Islamophobic in its tone,” she said. “We’re hoping that this will send a strong message to, specifically candidates who are taking public office, but anyone who has a platform. And encourages them to speak more responsibly.” Contact us at letters@time.com.",2016-02-02 18:01:11,Obama Will Visit a Mosque for the First Time as President,,40362,http://www.time.com/time/

 	        | Capitol Buzz: Five things to watch today in Tallahassee »  @ByKristenMClark Florida's 160 lawmakers could inconspicuously pack heat in the state House and Senate chambers and legislative meetings, under a provision tacked on to a controversial open-carry handguns proposal that's expected to pass the Florida House on Wednesday. The amendment by Rep. John Wood, R-Winter Haven, was one of almost two dozen proposed changes that representatives vetted -- and a handful they approved -- during three hours of debate that stretched past 9 p.m. Tuesday over two high-profile gun bills. The measures alter how 1.4 million people with concealed weapons permits in Florida can carry handguns. The Republican-dominated House accepted Wood's idea by a 72-43 vote to allow lawmakers to carry concealed guns in legislative sessions and official meetings, but it's possible the change could prove fatal for the measure, which already faced a tough climb in the Senate. Both the open-carry measure and another that would allow permit-holders to carry concealed on public university and college campuses are likely to pass the House. But across the Capitol, Senate Judiciary Chairman Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, said he won't hear the campus-carry proposal in his committee for the second year in a row, and he indicated last week he could change his mind and not hear the open-carry plan, either. The two measures are endorsed by the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups, but opponents cite numerous safety concerns. Heading into Tuesday's House debate, more than 40 amendments were filed to the open-carry bill but almost half were later withdrawn; those were mostly rebuttals that bill sponsor and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, initially sought. All but one of the others -- Wood's -- were filed by Democrats, as an attempt to chip away at the proposal and add exclusions to where concealed-carry permit-holders could openly carry. Each Democratic amendment failed by wide margins with almost entirely Republican support. The Democrats' suggestions included measures to: -- limit high-capacity magazines on openly carried weapons, -- restrict foreigners seeking U.S. citizenship from receiving a concealed weapons permit, -- and prohibit the open-carrying of handguns within 500 feet of movie theaters, religious institutions, voting locations, school safety zones and bars or restaurants that serve alcohol. To plead their case of why the safeguards were needed, Democrats invoked several mass-shooting incidents from recent years. Among them: the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting two months ago, the Charleston, S.C., church shooting last summer, the Aurora, Co., movie theater shooting and Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., both in 2012, and the attempted assassination of an Arizona congresswoman in 2011. Republicans and moderate Democrats said the incidents cited weren't relevant to the debate and they rejected the amendments as unnecessary, redundant or an infringement on residents' Second Amendment rights. ""This amendment has nothing to do with what happened at those particular places or those particular tragic incidents. No open carry was at issue there,"" Rep. Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, D-Tallahassee, said of the proposed restriction near churches. She co-sponsored the campus-carry bill. Gaetz has promoted his open-carry bill as a means to ""vindicate"" Floridians' Second Amendment rights. The Florida Police Chiefs Association supports it, but groups representing sheriffs and police officers are opposed.  Critics argue that having Florida join 45 other states that allow open carry could harm its tourist industry and subject residents to ""intimidation"" when gun-owners carry in public. The measure was earlier amended to specify the right of private property owners -- from grocery stores and churches to Disney World and Sea World -- to decide whether to allow patrons to carry weapons concealed, openly or at all. Republicans argued that provision was sufficient to ease opponents' concerns about where people might openly carry, but that only frustrated Democrats further. ""We’ve become so inflexible on this issue that we can’t even agree that guns don’t belong within 1 foot of a church,"" said Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Coral Springs, who sponsored most of the Democratic amendments. ""It’s OK to infringe on the right to bear arms at Disney World -- you’re all OK with that -- but you’re not willing to do it within 1 foot of a church."" Among the approved amendments, though, was a compromise offered by Gaetz that addressed one concern Democrats discussed last week in committee; it would allow public hospitals to restrict guns from being openly carried. Other changes approved were redundant measure that cancelled out Moskowitz's proposed changes affecting foreigners, permanent non-U.S. residents and people visiting the U.S. on visas. Gaetz successfully added language banning illegal immigrants from receiving conceal-carry permits -- which is already prohibited under state law, as Gaetz acknowledged. Wood said he sought the conceal-carry exemption for lawmakers because ""we allow the judiciary -- an equal co-branch of government -- to have that privilege."" ""It should be enjoyed by duly elected officials, such as ourselves,"" he said. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, filed a related bill this session to lift restrictions and let all legally permitted gun-owners carry concealed in most any government meeting at the local, county and state level but it hasn't been heard. Earlier in the evening, House members also debated the so-called ""guns on campus"" bill by Steube and Rehwinkel Vasilinda, which is on track to stall for the second year. Steube spent an hour answering questions from more than a dozen lawmakers, most of them Democrats. Their questions targeted the safety of allowing guns on college and university campuses -- environments, they argued, that can include parties with alcohol and potentially drugs, young adults facing mentally and emotionally stressful situations and children who attend daycare, camps or charter school programs. ""I think that people should have the right to defend themselves, and our gun-free zones have shown themselves to be targets time and time again for terrorists and mass shooters,"" Steube said. He added that he's not ""not trying to deputize or have a quasi-police force in concealed permit holders."" He dismissed assertions that law enforcement wouldn't be able to tell ""good guys"" from ""bad guys"" in active-shooter situations, because he said officers are trained to know the difference. College and university presidents and police chiefs resoundingly oppose the proposal, as do some faculty and student groups and the League of Women Voters. But Steube said he's heard from professors, staff and students who want it. In responding to questions, Steube said multiple times that he knows of no data that proves allowing concealed guns on campuses would increase crime. He rejected that the bill would impose costs on colleges and universities, although those institutions have said they'd have to spend tens of millions of dollars to beef up security and training for campus police forces, should the proposal become law. Steube twice deflected questions about what impact his bill would have if it and Gaetz's open-carry measure were both enacted, but Gaetz later addressed it. ""Yes, under those circumstances, it would be permissible to have open carry on campus,"" Gaetz said. Photo credit: The Florida Channel Posted by Kristen M.

The Federal Aviation Administration has declared the airspace above Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara to be a no-fly zone and that includes drones, so leave yours at home.""Bring your lucky jersey. Bring your face paint. Bring your team spirit. But leave your drone at home.""The FAA made a 20-second video to remind people not to fly their drones within a 32-mile radius of Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara between 2 p.m. and midnight on game day. Officials are also prepared to use ""deadly force"" to remove your drone from the sky if they deem it a security threat, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a statement.""With so many drones being sold for recreational use, we want to do everything we can to get the word out that the game is a No Drone Zone. We're working closely with our safety and security partners to spread this message as widely as possible.""The no-fly zone over Levi's Stadium also means there won't be any parachuting into the Super Bowl. Sorry. The no drone zone over the Super Bowl is similar to last year's ban, but in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks and the San Bernardino mass shooting, law enforcement is taking no chances with game day security this year. They've amassed a huge security force consisting of F-16 fighter jets, helicopters, tanker planes, K-9 units, and tactical teams along with local and state police officers backed by federal agents. Bottom line: don't mess with Super Bowl security. If you do, it could mean serious jail time and/or hefty fines. One of the biggest threats facing the year's biggest football game is air poisoning by drone attack, which is what prompted the FAA to get the word out early about the no-fly zone.FAA: Drones Flown Around the Super Bowl Could Face 'Deadly Force' - NBC News https://t.co/hibHqD5n1Q #GONG pic.twitter.com/JtASS3wscb— Damian Vanore (@DamianVanore23) February 3, 2016A record number of unmanned drones were given as gifts during Christmas, and the Silicon Valley is likely to be home to more drone owners than other areas.

As part of the process owners must certify that they've read and understood a series of guidelines produced by the FAA including the prohibition of flying drones over major sporting events. The mandatory registration system was developed because several irresponsible drone owners flew their aircraft in dangerous or restricted areas.Could spy #drones above #SuperBowl practice fields warrant litigation? https://t.co/i6LcU0JqKo pic.twitter.com/HEcFf6tKOP— RBR (@RoboticBusiness) February 3, 2016Along with flying too close to firefighter tanker planes and landing on the White House lawn, one drone crash-landed into stands at the U.S. Open.

You'd at least call 911. You'd likely stay with the person while the ambulance was coming. And if you were trained, you might even start CPR. Chances are that human decency would motivate you to do something. So why is it that when we see obvious signs of mental or emotional crisis in a friend, colleague or even a casual acquaintance, our first reaction is to withdraw? We typically consider behavioral health issues too personal for our intervention, out of bounds for anyone but a family member or a very close friend. That pretty much defines the challenge facing the National Council for Behavioral Health, which trains people in its Mental Health First Aid course. The goal of the eight-hour session is to help people recognize when someone is suffering from a mental health or substance abuse disorder and to encourage intervention. ""The truth of the matter is that you are more likely to encounter someone who is experiencing a behavioral health condition or crisis"" than someone facing a physical emergency, said Laira Roth, the council's project manager for the first aid course. Every year, the organization notes, one in four Americans will suffer from mental illness or addiction. Half a million people across the country already have taken the training, including first lady Michelle Obama. ""The biggest message ... is that an individual has the capacity to help,"" said America Paredes, an instructor in the course. Are you going to avert a mass shooting? Unlikely. Could you stop or postpone a suicide attempt? Definitely. But how? By making a connection with someone who may have no one else to talk to. By suggesting that he or she seek professional help, right now. By offering some ideas about how that could be done, maybe even helping to place the call. In other words, by responding — the same way you'd grab an automatic defibrillator and try to use it on someone who had collapsed, even if you weren't entirely sure how. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 41,149 suicides in 2013, making suicide the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States. As uncomfortable or difficult as some questions can be, they can save a life. Imagine asking someone you don't know all that well: ""Are you thinking of killing yourself?"" The course helps people overcome their reluctance, even fear, of getting involved. It makes clear that you can't plant the idea of suicide in someone's head, which is why many people hold off. It teaches you how, and when, to try to help. ""If you don't know the right question to ask, you're not going to ask it because you're afraid of saying something stupid,"" Paredes said. The best approach boils down to a five-letter acronym, ALGEE. You may never have to use this information, but here it is: A: Assess for risk of suicide or harm. L: Listen nonjudgmentally. G: Give reassurance and information. E: Encourage appropriate professional help. E: Encourage self-help and other support strategies.",2016-02-03 23:22:55,Course's goal is to help you help someone with a mental illness,,22,http://www.tampabay.com/
9,http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/tampa-city-council-to-vote-on-long-demanded-fix-to-historic-cuscaden-park/2263978,"TAMPA — After years of requests from neighbors, the City Council on Thursday agreed to spend $3.1 million to fix the historic pool at Cuscaden Park. But the approval came with a warning from council Chairman Frank Reddick, a leading voice for the project. Don't repeat the mistakes made when the city spent $2.5 million trying to fix the pool in 2005, he said. By 2009, the pool was leaking again, and it's been closed ever since. If something like that happens again, Reddick said, and the city hasn't made arrangements to hold the contractor accountable — something that didn't happen the last time — ""there's going to be hell to pay."" City officials say this time, they decided not only to refinish the entire surface of the pool, but also to install a liner with a 20-year warranty against leaks. That, along with a competitive construction market, is one of the reasons the cost of the project has risen from an estimated $1.8 million to $3.1 million. ""It's not cheap,"" Mayor Bob Buckhorn said this week. ""Costs change over time, and the demand for labor and construction materials is significantly higher than it was two or three years ago when we started this."" One of the residents who has pushed for the project was elated at the vote. ""Great news"" for V.M. Ybor and East Tampa, tweeted Kim Headland, past president of the V.M. Ybor Neighborhood Association. ""Huge thanks to councilman Reddick and Mayor Buckhorn."" Unhappy was council member Lisa Montelione, who cast the lone vote against the project. Montelione said she recognizes the importance of the 79-year-old Cuscaden pool and supports historic preservation. But she protested the city's decision to cover the increased construction cost by diverting money from a planned expansion of the New Tampa Community Center and from leftover funds from a project at the Greco Sports Complex, both of which are in her North Tampa district. Requests to budget money for the community center expansion have already been put off twice in the five years that she has been on the council, she said. Meanwhile, the popular and low-cost youth gymnastics program at the center — one of only two such programs at city facilities — has a waiting list of kids. If the center were expanded, she said, the program could be, too. ""It's a vital project,"" she said of the pool. ""I think it needs to be done. I just think that the money can come from somewhere else rather than robbing it from one pot and putting it into the other."" While sympathetic to Montelione, other council members said they felt the pool repair represents a serious and worthwhile attempt to correct problems at the Cuscaden pool for good. ""I learned to swim there,"" council member Yvonne Yolie Capin said. ""It is a very important cultural asset to our city."" Council member Charlie Miranda, who grew up nearby, said he learned something else there. ""I learned how to jump the fence,"" he said. ""I used to jump the fence at the Cuscaden Park pool to jump in the pool because we didn't have a quarter to get in to swim."" The contractor, Tampa Contracting Services of Palmetto, is expected to begin work on the pool next month and finish in late July.

10,http://www.startribune.com/local/367675861.html,"Permits to carry a gun in Minnesota soared in the month of January, the state’s second largest surge since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. Since the beginning of the new year, there have been at least 221,712 active permit holders — a 6,189 increase from December 2015, according to a monthly data report from the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). The largest spike was in March 2013 with 7,213 active permit holders, a few months after the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., and subsequent calls for national gun control measures. A similar pattern of jumps in permit holders and applications are typically seen after prominent mass shootings, including the November Paris terrorist attacks and the December killings in San Bernardino, Calif.  In early January, President Obama announced executive orders aimed at reducing gun violence and placing new restrictions on handgun sales across the country. Almost in reflex, there’s a run on ammunition, gun sale background checks increase, interest in and enrollment in permit classes go up, and more people get their permits, said Andrew Rothman, president of the Gun Owners Civil Rights Alliance (GOCRA), which released the report Thursday. “It’s not always a reaction to mass shootings, although there is some of that,” Rothman said. “But probably the bigger part is the reaction when people hear about the political rhetoric following a horrible murder … that’s what gets people very interested in exercising their rights.” The number of active carry permits in the state has grown by more than 20,000 in six months. Now, about one in 19 eligible Minnesota adults have a permit to carry, according to GOCRA. In January, Hennepin County saw 733 new permits; Ramsey County saw 299 and Anoka County saw 220, according to the BCA. Permits are valid for five years, so the report is a mix of renewing and new permit holders. Cmdr. Paul Sommer, a spokesman with the Anoka County Sheriff’s Office, said in January 2013 — a month after Sandy Hook — there were 542 permit to carry applications. In January 2016, the Sheriff’s Office had 489 applications. They typically process about 200 a month. “We are still getting upward of 40 applicants a day, which is well beyond our norm,” Sommer said. Staff hours have increased and employees from other departments had to be moved to help with the growth, he said. Heather Martens, executive director of Protect Minnesota, a gun violence prevention organization, said she is not surprised by the growth. An uptick in permits, she said, doesn’t necessarily correlate to an increase in gun ownership. “An increase in permits indicates to me two things. One, many Minnesota gun owners are perfectly OK with undergoing a background check. A background check is required in order to get a pistol or pistol carry permit,” Martens said in an e-mail. “Two, a significant number of Minnesotans believe that having a gun makes them safer, and unfortunately, this is not true except in very narrow circumstances. It means we have a lot of work to do in educating the public about the hazards posed by guns..”  Twitter: @KarenAnelZamora   © 2021 StarTribune.

Every Monday The Okay, Okla., district put up signs on campus this week alerting visitors that school employees can be armed and 'may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students.' Do such policies promote a sense of security or unease? February 4, 2016 A rural school district in Oklahoma put up signs this week alerting visitors that some staff members have access to guns, in what it says is an effort aimed at deterring school violence. Schools in Okay, Okla., about 48 miles southeast of Tulsa put up signs that read, “Please be aware that certain staff members at Okay Public Schools can be legally armed and may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students,” the Tulsa World reports. The signs follow up on a gun policy in the district’s schools – which serve 420 students – approved by the school board in August that says staff members may bring a gun to campus concealed on their person or kept in a locked box. “Having a sign in your front yard saying ‘this is a gun-free zone’ just tells the idiots, “Come on in,” because we can’t defend ourselves,” Superintendent Charles McMahan told the World on Wednesday. “[Okay’s] sign might be enough to send somebody down the road looking for some other soft target. If that’s what it does, it’s helping our school district out,” he added. The superintendent says the requirements of Okay’s policy exceed those of the state, which require anyone who carries a handgun on school property to have a concealed-carry license and be certified by the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, a statewide group. Nationally the idea of guns in schools appears to divide Americans, as The Christian Science Monitor’s Molly Jackson reported in October. Following the mass shooting at a school in Sandy Hook, Conn., in 2012, the National Rifle Association called for armed guards at all public schools, with NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre saying that “the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” A 2013 Huffington Post survey found that 38 percent favored letting teachers and school officials carry guns, while 40 percent opposed the idea. Another poll by the National Education Association found that just 22 percent agreed that teachers who received firearms training should be able to bring guns to school, with 68 percent opposed. In South Carolina, lawmakers filed two bills this winter that mandate gun safety courses and Second Amendment-relate curricula in state schools. One bill would establish a Second Amendment Awareness Day on Dec. 15, the anniversary of the Sandy Hook shootings, each year. The bill also includes a clause requiring new gun and Second Amendment-related curriculum to be either created or approved by the NRA. In Okay, the superintendent said his administration was looking for a way to keep students safe and secure, noting that the Okay Police Department was disbanded in December 2014. While sheriff’s deputies in Wagoner County are available to respond to emergencies, Mr. McMahan told the Muskogee Phoenix that it is “seconds, not minutes that matter.” There were 65 school shootings in 2015, some that led to injuries, some intentional and some unintentional, according to Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, a research arm of the gun violence prevention group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Richard Antosh, an Okay student, told the Phoenix that he and several peers supported the policy, saying they trusted their teachers if a threat arose. Many of the students learned of the policy only after school officials erected the signs. But Richard told the Phoenix that he worried what would happen “if a kid tried to get the gun [from an employee] and hurt someone.” Other Oklahoma districts told the paper that they relied on local police to maintain security at their schools. “To make it short and sweet, we just don't think it's safe,” said Curtis Curry, the superintendent in Porum, Okla., which had a total population of 727 in 2010. In Okay, McMahan, the superintendent, said one school employee is currently approved to carry a firearm. It’s the only school in the local Green County area with an armed-employee policy, he said. “Our standards are higher,” McMahan told the Phoenix. “We really wanted people to know this is serious to us; we don't take this issue lightly.” Already a subscriber?

14,http://www.inquisitr.com/2770775/maryland-assault-weapons-ban-ruling-by-appeals-court-says-ban-violates-second-amendment/,"A Maryland assault weapons ban and other laws aimed at reducing gun violence were shot down by a federal appeals court on Thursday. A coalition of gun owners, businesses, and gun advocacy groups have been challenging a 2013 law that targeted specific kinds of semi-automatic firearms, like AR-15s and AK-47s. U.S. Court of Appeals says a Maryland gun law violates the Constitution. [Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]As reported by the Huffington Post, a panel of judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the Maryland ban on many semi-automatic rifles already possessed by millions of Americans was a violation of rights protected by the Constitution. ""In our view, Maryland law implicates the core protection of the Second Amendment -- the right of law-abiding responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home,"" wrote Chief Judge William Traxler. He added that the Maryland ban significantly impedes this right. Former Governor Martin O'Malley signed the Maryland Firearm Safety Act right after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The Act outlawed the ownership of 45 different semi-automatic firearms and put significant restrictions on large-capacity magazines. It also imposed more registration and licensing requirements on gun owners. Shortly thereafter, gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association, began challenging the legislation. They contended the newly added restrictions did not save lives and were too far-reaching. ""Maryland's ban on commonly owned firearms and magazines clearly violates our fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense. The highest level of judicial scrutiny should apply when governments try to restrict our Second Amendment freedoms,"" commented Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. Many Second Amendment supporters have challenged gun control laws in other states like New York and have met little success. Late last year, a Manhattan federal appeals court upheld many gun control laws that were passed in New York and Connecticut after the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre. In December, the Supreme Court decided not to review an Illinois court ruling that supported an assault weapons ban similar to the Maryland one. Through several past rulings, the Supreme Court has held that the Second Amendment protects a person's right to keep and bear arms for self-defense within the home. However, lower court judges have been struggling to apply those rulings to the wave of new gun control measures. With rulings nationwide inconsistent and without concrete standards, the exact interpretation of the Second Amendment has come into question. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is concerned about the erosion of rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment. ""If a broad ban on firearms can be upheld based on conjecture that the public might feel safer (while being no safer at all), then the Second Amendment guarantees nothing,"" he wrote. The decision Thursday on Maryland's assault weapons ban may be a win for those who want a wider interpretation of the Second Amendment. Yet some see another Supreme Court challenge close at hand. ""This case was a major victory for the NRA and gun rights advocates,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA who specializes in Second Amendment law. ""This opinion is an important one because it subjects important gun control laws to the most strict form of judicial scrutiny."" In a related Inquisitr report, many gun rights advocates felt the Second Amendment was under attack in early January after President Obama announced a plan to take executive action on gun control. Thursday's Court of Appeals assault weapons ruling was a win for gun rights supporters. [Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images]The 66-page decision by the 4th Circuit court did not reverse the Maryland assault weapons prohibition, but demanded a lower court to hold the provision to a higher legal standard. This ruling only sets the stage for more legal battles and the eventuality of a Supreme Court review. One member of the 4th Circuit did argue that the Maryland ban should be upheld and implied the court's ruling would only lead to another mass shooting. ""Let's be real,"" wrote Circuit Judge Robert King. ""The assault weapons banned by Maryland's [law] are exceptionally lethal weapons of war."" While the ruling sends the case back to the lower court's hands for additional review, the Maryland assault weapons ban will remain in effect.

In the middle of 2015, Twitter began suspending social media accounts for threatening or promoting terrorist attacks and recruiting new ISIS members, the company wrote on its blog.""We condemn the use of Twitter to promote terrorism and the Twitter Rules make it clear that this type of behavior, or any violent threat, is not permitted on our service.""Twitter has a team of programmers who monitor the platform to ensure users stay within its written guidelines, but the site largely relies on users to alert the company about violations. Friday's announcement is the first time Twitter has shared information about its efforts to stop ISIS and other terrorists from using its services.The social media company has come under pressure from the Obama administration in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks and San Bernardino mass shooting to do more to stop ISIS and other terrorists using its platform. Along with suspending the 125,000 ISIS-associated accounts, Twitter has also increased the size of its review team and introduced new spam software to track potentially violating accounts, the company reported.""We condemn the use of Twitter to promote terrorism. As the nature of the terrorist threat has changed, so has our ongoing work in this area."" Gunmen in both the Paris terrorist attacks and the San Bernardino mass shooting viewed extremist material on the Internet although it's not clear that they communicated their plans using social media. The government is concerned about the ease with which ISIS and other terrorist groups engage in conversation and recruitment on social media and has been pressuring Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites to do more to limit access to terrorists.Government officials met technology company executives in California's Silicon Valley in January to discuss possible techniques to stop ISIS and other terror groups from using social media to recruit new members. Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced legislation that would require social media sites to alert law enforcement if they found terrorist activity on their websites. That was the same day Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on Silicon Valley to ""disrupt"" ISIS activity, according to the USA Today. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has called for a shutdown of the internet in ISIS-controlled Syria and Iraq to help stem the tide of terrorism. He suggested the U.S. government contact Bill Gates to help. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook must walk a fine line between working with the government and allowing users free rein on their platforms.

17,http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/q5qgKizivV4/,"A major gun control law has been shot down, with the Maryland assault weapons ban being overturned by a panel of judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. Based upon the decision of the judges, banning assault weapons violated the core of the Second Amendment, an interpretation heavily endorsed by the NRA. The Maryland decision apparently creates a contradiction in the law since the 7th Circuit Court ruled in favor of an assault weapon ban in 2015. While the U.S. Supreme Court declined to see that gun control case, some reports claim liberals will be in a panic soon since it's possible the highest court in America may soon decide to make the final determination on gun rights. In the two-to-one decision by the 4th Circuit, the judges concluded that the semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines banned by Maryland's Firearm Safety Act ""are in common use by law-abiding citizens."" As such, the assault weapons ban was deemed unconstitutional since the weapons do not fall under the Second Amendment exception applied to machine guns, hand grenades, and other ""unusual"" weapons. ""In our view, Maryland law implicates the core protection of the Second Amendment — the right of law-abiding responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home,"" wrote Chief Judge William Traxler. U.S. Court of Appeals says Maryland gun law violates Constitution. [Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]The Maryland gun control law is similar to an Illinois assault weapons ban which was challenged in the case of Friedman v. City Of Highland Park. Dr. Arie Friedman and the Illinois State Rifle Association claimed the city of Highland Park violated citizen's Second Amendment rights by banning certain semi-automatic weapons in addition to banning ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammo. In April of 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit ruled two to one in favor of the Illinois gun control law, although Judge Frank Easterbrook said the U.S. Supreme Court needed to solidify the uncertainty left by two cases, District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. City of Chicago. ""Heller and McDonald set limits on the regulation of firearms; but within those limits, they leave matters open. The best way to evaluate the relation among assault weapons, crime, and self‐defense is through the political process and scholarly debate, not by parsing ambiguous passages in the Supreme Court's opinions,"" said Easterbrook, who was in favor of the assault weapons ban.

Judge Daniel Manion disagreed with the two other judges, claiming the ban ""violates the Second Amendment rights of its citizens"" and represents an ""enormous transfer of authority from the citizens of this country to the government – a result directly contrary to our Constitution and to our political tradition."" The attorneys for Friedman also tried appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court, although Highland Park petitioned the Court to deny the appeal. ""The Seventh Circuit upheld bans on commonly possessed firearms and magazines that clearly are unconstitutional under Heller, and it did so by applying a newly minted three-part test, all three parts of which stand in direct conflict with. Enough is enough,"" explained the appeal brief. [Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]According to Hot Air, the recent overturning of the Maryland gun control law may be enough for the U.S. Supreme Court to take action. ""This apparent contradiction between the 7th Circuit Court's ruling in Friedman v. City of Highland Park and the 4th's ruling in Maryland has likely provided enough contrast for the Supremes to take up the question. This, as you might imagine, has liberal gun rights opponents in a state of panic, as a ruling agreeing with the rationale cited by the 4th Circuit Court would essentially kill off any similar rifle bans around the nation,"" said the report. A report by the Constitution Daily notes that Highland Park claimed the Illinois assault weapons ban only affected ""highly dangerous weapons that have been used in a series of mass shooting events, and it does not violate the Second Amendment."" As a comparison, Hot Air looked to the FBI's gun deaths data for 2014 and discovered that only about 3 percent of all shooting deaths involved ""rifles of all types."" Based upon this information, the report claims the U.S. Supreme Court should get rid of the term ""assault rifle"" entirely and ""these weapons should be looped in with the rest of the firearms in widespread, legal, safe use.""

Larycia Hawkins, a tenured political science professor, had been scheduled for a disciplinary hearing in five days’ time, to determine whether she would be allowed to remain at Wheaton. A joint statement said Hawkins and the college had “found a mutual place of resolution and reconciliation” and that the two sides “will part ways” after reaching a confidential agreement. The controversy began on 10 December, when Hawkins wrote on Facebook that she would don the hijab headscarf during the period of advent before Christmas as a sign of solidarity with Muslims. “We worship the same god,” she said in her post. The post drew criticism amid a broader debate regarding the role and treatment of Muslims in the US following the November mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, which authorities have said was inspired by the militant group Islamic State. The college placed Hawkins on administrative leave as a result. Last month, the school’s provost recommended Hawkins be fired. The school previously said Hawkins was disciplined not because she chose to wear a hijab but because her “theological statements seem inconsistent with Wheaton’s doctrinal convictions”. Both sides struck a conciliatory tone in the statement, which also said neither Hawkins nor school officials would offer any further comment until a scheduled news conference on Wednesday morning. “I appreciate and have great respect for the Christian liberal arts and the ways that Wheaton College exudes that in its mission, programs, and in the caliber of its employees and students,” Hawkins said in the statement. The college president, Phillip Ryken, said the school “sincerely appreciates Dr Hawkins’ contributions to this institution over the last nine years”. Many members of the faculty had expressed support for Hawkins. Bill Struthers, a Wheaton psychology professor, posted a photo on Facebook on Saturday night of himself holding a handwritten sign reading, “I support Larycia.” Wheaton, founded in 1860 and in the Illinois town of the same name, has approximately 2,400 undergraduate students and 480 graduate students.",2016-02-07 09:38:16,Christian college professor to step down after saying Muslims worship same god,"christians and christianity,religion and churches,islam,church-state relations",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Federal law prohibits the production, distribution, reception, and possession of an image of child pornography using or affecting any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce (See 18 U.S.C. § 2251; 18 U.S.C. § 2252; 18 U.S.C. § 2252A).

""Take a photograph of yourself or somebody else nude and send it to somebody else, you've committed the crime. That was the only charge that really fits what they were doing,"" said Chenot.

It was the second mass shooting at a Florida nightclub this weekend. The shooting took place just before 1 a.m. with about 300 people inside the Glitz Ultra Lounge. Three off-duty Orlando Police Department officers were working security at the club when the shooting started, the Orlando Sentinel reported (http://bit.ly/1mlKHAt). Police spokeswoman Michelle Guido said it's not clear what prompted the shooting or if any of the off-duty officers fired their weapons. As many as three shooters are being sought. One person was shot and killed inside the club, police said. Nine were taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds. Of those, one died at the hospital, one is in critical condition and the rest are being treated for injuries that were not life-threatening. Two others — including one with a gunshot wound — were seen at another hospital. In addition to the off-duty officers, the club has its own security, police said.

          / CBS/AP ORLANDO, Florida -- A shooting erupted inside a nightclub packed with hundreds of people in the city's tourist district early Sunday, killing two people and injuring 10 others, authorities said. It was the second mass shooting at a Florida nightclub this weekend. The shooting took place just before 1 a.m. with about 300 people inside the Glitz Ultra Lounge. Three off-duty Orlando Police Department officers were working security at the club when the shooting started, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Police spokeswoman Michelle Guido said it's not clear what prompted the shooting or if any of the off-duty officers fired their weapons. ""The club has very good security, with their own guards as well as three off-duty police officers. The club did everything it was supposed to do,"" said Guido to CBS affiliate WKMG. As many as three shooters are being sought. One person was shot and killed inside the club, police said. Nine were taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds. Of those, one died at the hospital, one is in critical condition and the rest are being treated for injuries that were not life-threatening. Two others -- including one with a gunshot wound -- were seen at another hospital. In addition to the off-duty officers, the club has its own security, police said. Detectives are reviewing security video from the club in hopes of gleaning clues. In Tampa, eight people were shot at a strip club on Saturday. A 21-year-old man died. No arrests have been made in that case. First published on February 7, 2016 / 7:01 PM © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

23,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/8HMKM3HUt2k/,"Arne Duncan’s administration of the Education Department saw plenty of notable accomplishments: billions of new dollars for preschool, a rewrite of the country’s primary K-12 education law, a record high school graduation rate. Yet for all he achieved in his seven years, a reflective Duncan said he’s disappointed to leave office without having made sufficient progress in several other areas, including school desegregation. He sees a connection between his top three self-proclaimed disappointments — failure to further expand preschool, offer financial aid to undocumented students and clamp down on gun violence. They all reflect, he says, an unwillingness to protect and invest in children. “It’s just not seeing our children as the assets — as the extraordinary potential — that they truly are,” he said in an exclusive interview with The 74. More notable, perhaps, is Duncan’s admission that he couldn’t do enough to desegregate the country’s schools. In some regions, America’s schools are now more segregated than they were in the late 1960s. “I would give myself a pretty low grade on that,” he said. Duncan said the department poured millions of dollars into magnet schools, public schools with a specialized focus or curriculum designed to draw a diverse group of students. Some, like those in Hartford, Connecticut, are making a big impact, but the program largely failed to make a noticeable difference integrating the country’s schools. “I don’t so much blame those districts and schools,” he said. He posited that perhaps his department didn’t ask grant recipients the right kinds of questions, or didn’t give the money to the right places. The country “can and should do more” to integrate schools, both by race and income, he said. Duncan said he’ll never advocate integration achieved by forced busing, but instead thinks schools should offer a wide variety of excellent choices to entice all types of families. Duncan was one of President Obama’s original Cabinet appointees in 2009. He left office at the end of the year and returned to Chicago, where his family had moved last fall. Duncan said he’s been talking to people locally and nationally about what he’ll do next but for now is enjoying time with his two kids, Ryan and Claire, helping with homework and making them breakfast. Duncan’s successor, John King, has a “huge interest and passion and expertise” in school desegregation, the former secretary said. He predicted King would make the issue a primary focus during his limited time in office. (King signaled during a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day speech that he intended to do just that.) 74Million: Exclusive Video: Rubio Says Clinton ‘Owned’ By Unions, Decries System Where Only Rich Choose Schools Although Duncan painted desegregation efforts as largely a flop, there were both successes and failures at all levels of education — preschool, K-12 and higher education, he said.




For the youngest children, Duncan was pleased at the federal investment during his tenure, which topped $1 billion, but was frustrated he couldn’t persuade congressional Republicans to do more. In K-12, he touted the country’s record high school graduation rate. Although that rate, around 82 percent, has risen, and dropout rates have fallen for every racial subgroup, there are still around 750,000 students leaving school every year with “basically no chance of being successful,” he said. And in higher education, Duncan cited funding increases to the Pell Grant program, higher college attendance and graduation rates for students of color, and a new emphasis on campus safety and preventing sexual assaults. He’s discouraged, though, that the United States no longer leads the world in college completion rates. The top spot is shared by Canada and Russia, where 53 percent of 25- to 64-year-olds have a “tertiary” degree, according to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development. In the U.S., it’s 41 percent. “In every area, I am both proud of the progress and frustrated that as a nation we’re not getting better, faster, and there’s still tremendous unmet need at every level,” he said. Perhaps Duncan’s biggest priority in recent years — expanding federal supports for preschool programs — is also one of his biggest letdowns. “We’re cutting off our nose to spite our face. It just makes no sense,” he said. Duncan and other pre-K backers often point to research that investing in early learning programs saves money in the long run as children are kept out of costly special education programs and are less likely to be incarcerated or become teen parents. He also cites two areas that were arguably not under his purview — the failure to pass a bill allowing federal financial aid eligibility for undocumented immigrant college students and any kind of substantive change to gun laws — as among the areas he would’ve liked to see a different outcome. A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling requires states to enroll students in public elementary and secondary schools no matter their immigration status. (The Education Department during Duncan’s tenure released written guidelines reminding districts of that obligation, particularly after waves of unaccompanied children came to the country from Central America in recent years.)




If those students make it to college, though, they aren’t eligible for federal student loans or Pell Grants. Duncan said gun violence was the hardest issue he dealt with during his time as Chicago’s school superintendent, and the problem has only gotten worse. He compared the U.S. to Australia, where a conservative government changed gun laws in the wake of a mass shooting in 1996. A generation of children have grown up there not knowing what a mass shooting is, while in the U.S., such violent events seem to happen several times a week, he said. “Other nations just value their children, value lives, more than our nation does. There’s no other way to put it,” he said. 


 
Testing Backlash Duncan also defended his administration’s emphasis on tying teacher evaluations to student test scores in part through No Child Left Behind waivers and Race to the Top grants. Some have said those policies caused a proliferation of tests, a factor in the national backlash to testing and the opt-out movement. It’s important, Duncan said, to compare a new policy to what was in place before it. In this case, some states had laws totally barring tying test scores and evaluations. “It was unbelievable to me,” Duncan said. “It was basically saying that great teaching doesn’t matter.” A total ban on linking test scores and evaluations doesn’t strengthen teaching as a profession, nor does it help kids, he said. The administration also challenged states to think about the amount of time spent on testing, he said. “My hope is that five years from now, [states and districts will] be much smarter” in how they implement testing and teacher evaluations, he said. “The way to get better [at it] is not to put your head in the sand.” #EDlection2016 Duncan said he’s been frustrated that education issues haven’t been more prevalent — or oftentimes mentioned at all — in the presidential campaign. In particular, he thinks all candidates should have to answer how they’ll increase access to early childhood education (and if they won’t, why not), what their goals are for high school graduation and dropout rates, and how they’ll get the U.S. to once again be the global leader in percent of college graduates.




“This is in our nation’s interest. A good strong military is our best defense, but a good education system is our best offense,” he said. The other education issues that have come up in the campaign so far — say, Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable comments on charter schools — are “small-ball sound bites,” Duncan said. No one person or party has a monopoly on good ideas on how to tackle those issues, he said, it’s just essential to have the conversation at all: “We’re fighting for kids here and we’re fighting for our country.” This article originally appearedon The74Million.org

24,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/136651119/0/phoenix/opinions~My-Turn-Support-more-guns-Watch-murder-first/,"Arizona state legislators are working to pass a law, Senate Bill 1257, which would require public building owners to install metal detectors and security guards in their public buildings. According to this clever little proposal, if owners refuse, or simply cannot afford the estimated $100,000 expense, they must allow gun-toting citizens to enter their buildings. SB 1257 is just the latest in a range of laws being proposed, and passed, that are carving ways over, under, around and through existing laws seeking to maintain some control over the tide of guns flowing into our public spaces. I am proposing a different law be passed before SB 1257 or any other new gun law can be considered. At a time when women needing an abortion are forced to view pictures of bloody fetuses and teens wanting to drive cars must watch gory films of wreckage and death, it seems only fair that these legislators be forced to actually stand and watch a crazed man pump bullets into innocent bystanders. AZCENTRAL Arizona Regents vote to oppose guns-on-campus bill If the real thing is not available, a video will suffice. Guns today are extra speedy, so this will only take about 20 seconds of their time. It should not be a burdensome imposition on our elected officials. As one of the front-row witnesses to the shooting of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others, I have special expertise in this area. I know that once you have watched a crazed person pump bullets into people, one’s taste for guns, bullets, blood and death diminishes. In my case, I had worked for Gabrielle so I witnessed not just the death of strangers but the wounding and death of dear friends and colleagues. So, hey, just to keep it interesting, let’s require that the murders the legislators are forced to witness include at least one of their dear friends or family members taking a bullet. I am not opposed to anyone’s Second Amendment right to own a gun. My father owned a number of guns, and we celebrated more than one New Year’s Eve standing in the field across from our house shooting a bullet into the ground. But I also have a strong belief that I should have the right to go to Safeway to buy eggs and milk without the threat of being shot. I don’t think I should be forced to suffer flashbacks, cold sweats and a heart that feels like it is going to beat its way out of my chest when I happen to be in the express line at Safeway behind a man who has a holstered gun strapped round his belly. ROBERTS: Donate to Kelli Ward, win an AR-15 All I am asking is one little piece of legislation that requires anyone passing a gun law to first witness a murder. Let that person feel what it is like to watch helplessly as a crazed man stands calmly pumping bullets into innocent people, moving the gun back and forth like he is watering the lawn. Feel the utter terror and panic as cortisol floods the body, blood pressure spiking sky high, forever blotting out any sense of safety. Look down for just an instant on a member of Congress, bright red jacket and blonde hair, blood streaming down her face, silent and slumped. Once you have watched the video of this mass murder – or more apropos – been forced to watch one unfold in person, then and only then will you have the right to stand in a chamber of any legislative body, safely ensconced behind guards and metal-detected entrances, and spout meaningless words and sentiments about a single amendment to the Constitution that was crafted long before guns that murder, maim and upend lives can spit out 33 bullets in 19 seconds. Only then, dear elected officials, will I believe you have the expertise to even debate the issue of gun violence. Only then will I say, OK, guns, more guns and more guns. And may the next time someone opens fire on unarmed citizens, it be you, and not me, watching. Jacquelyn Jackson is a communications consultant in Tucson. She was formerly director of community outreach for former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.​",2016-02-08 08:54:34,My Turn: Support more guns? Watch murder first,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

30,http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/02/bay_county_sheriffs_office_get.html," Gallery: Bay County Sheriff Office receives new body armor BAY CITY, MI -- Should a mass-shooting event happen in Bay County, area police have some new equipment at their disposal to keep them safe as they combat the situation. The Bay County Sheriff's Office in September applied for grants to obtain active-shooter kits, which contain heavy-duty vests, helmets, goggles and trauma kits including tourniquets and QuikClot, a sand-like substance that stops bleeding quickly. In December, the office received a $6,751 grant from the Bay Area Community Foundation and $7,500 from the Justice Assistance Grant to purchase the gear. Since mid January, the sheriff's office has received 20 kits, with a total of 30 expected by the end of February. The vests, made by Spartan Armor Systems of Tucson, Ariz., weigh 17 1/2 pounds. ""We'll have enough vests so that every deputy will have one,"" said Undersheriff Troy Cunningham. ""Right now, the guys have soft body armor that they wear underneath their uniforms every day, which stops handguns and small rifles. What these will do is stop a lot of armor-piercing rounds and larger-caliber rifles like .30-06, .30-30s, .270s."" Bay County Sheriff's Deputy Art Kleinert with Lisa Cleland from the Bay Area Community Foundation. The vests are outfitted with two steel plates, which are designed to prevent a projectile from fragmenting and spewing shrapnel upon impact, Cunningham added. The kits did not cost Bay County or the sheriff's office any money, Cunningham said. Deputies won't be donning theses vests for their daily duties. The kits will be in deputies' patrol vehicles, ready for use if a situation calls for it. ""If the deputies are out and someone has a gun or we hear there is an active shooter or a mass casualty situation, they'll be ready to throw these vests on over top of their uniforms,"" Cunningham said. In August, police participated in a school shooting training scenario at the Bay-Arenac ISD Career Center in Monitor Township. The sheriff's office applied for the grants after that training. ""The reason we did this is with all of the events and everything that's going on throughout the nation and some of the rising trends with active shooters ... this gives our guys a way to be better equipped to handle those situations,"" Cunningham said. ""It's a way to make them a lot safer."" The undersheriff added he wants to thank the Bay Area Community Foundation for its part in keeping deputies safe.

	Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Apple CEO Tim Cook has issued a strongly worded statement that the company would not comply with a federal judge’s order to crack open an iPhone used by a suspect in December’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The standoff could become a watershed digital privacy case. Cook, in an 1,100-word letter posted on Apple’s site Wednesday, said the order amounts to the U.S. government requesting that the company build a “backdoor” into the iPhone — “something we consider too dangerous to create.” “The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers,” he wrote. “We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.”  A federal judge had granted the Justice Department’s request that Apple help unlock an iPhone 5C that was used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooting suspects. The Dec. 2 attack left 14 people dead and 22 others seriously wounded. The court instructed Apple to disable certain security measures of the iPhone so the FBI can obtain data stored on the device.  “Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation,” Cook said. “In the wrong hands, this software — which does not exist today — would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession.” That could result in a “master key” that would threaten the security of millions of iPhones, he said. Popular on Variety In a briefing Wednesday, a White House spokesman disputed the notion that the DOJ is asking Apple to “create a new backdoor to its products.” The request is specific to the San Bernardino shooting, he said, to let law-enforcement officials learn “as much as they can about this one case,” Reuters reported. Apple has cooperated with FBI requests following the San Bernardino incident, including providing “data that’s in our possession,” Cook added. But with the latest court order, he wrote, “The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers — including tens of millions of American citizens — from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals.” The Business of Entertainment",2016-02-17 18:09:38,Apple CEO Defies U.S. Order to Hack iPhone of San Bernardino Shooting Suspect,,19076,http://www.variety.com

Shortly after, Trump’s campaign issued a statement calling Cruz “desperate.” He floated the idea of another legal threat to Cruz regarding the Canadian-born candidate’s eligibility as president. ""If I want to bring a lawsuit it would be legitimate. Likewise, if I want to bring the lawsuit regarding Senator Cruz being a natural born Canadian I will do so,” Trump said. “Time will tell, Teddy."" Cruz’s comments came during a sprawling press conference, in which the Texas senator defended himself at length against accusations and attacks from both Trump and Marco Rubio, whom Cruz described as “Donald Trump with a smile.” After a third-place finish in Iowa and a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, Cruz said, it was Rubio who was getting desperate. “His campaign has not gotten the traction he wanted,” said Cruz. A Monmouth University poll of likely South Carolina voters released Wednesday showed Trump with a wide lead at 35%, followed by Cruz at 19% and Rubio at 17%.

Yet it is unclear that cracking an iPhone 5c will impact newer, more secure models As U.S. law enforcement escalates its battle to keep criminals from concealing their communication on digital devices or “going dark,” Apple CEO Tim Cook is digging in his heels in resisting government directives to support their investigations. A federal judge in California on Tuesday ordered Apple to step up efforts to help the FBI search the locked iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who, along with wife Tashfeen Malik, is suspected of a mass shooting at a December 2 holiday party last year in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people and injured 22. Cook quickly countered the court action with an open letter posted to his company’s site suggesting that the FBI’s request could open a Pandora’s box that undermines security on all iPhones. The issue at hand is not whether Apple can break into Farook’s iPhone 5c but rather whether the company should, as the FBI has requested, disable protections designed to keep people from guessing a device’s security passcode. This includes a delay feature that prevents someone from rapidly and repeatedly trying to guess a passcode as well as features that permanently encrypt or erase data after a number of unsuccessful passcode attempts. Police killed Farook and Malik in a shoot-out, leaving law enforcement without any means of obtaining the iPhone’s passcode unless it was written down somewhere. Cook’s greater concern is that the government has asked the company to build a backdoor to all its iPhones. “The U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create,” according to Cook. “The FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software—which does not exist today—would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession.” The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California ordered Apple to provide “reasonable technical assistance to assist law enforcement agents in obtaining access to the data” on the iPhone in question. Apple must provide the FBI with software that can bypass or disable the autoerase function that would eliminate data on the iPhone after several unsuccessful attempts to guess the passcode. The court also insists that the software rig the iPhone so that law enforcement can enter passcode guesses electronically using either the physical device port, Bluetooth or wi-fi, as opposed to just the touch screen. Another stipulation is that Apple must disable the built-in delay that makes users wait a certain amount of time between passcode guesses. According to a court filing, Apple “has declined to provide that assistance voluntarily.” Cook, however, countered that Apple has attempted to support the FBI’s investigation. This includes turning over data in the company’s possession, making Apple engineers available to advise the FBI and offering ideas on “a number of investigative options at their disposal.” Apple is not denying that it could comply with the court order but rather stating that the government is overreaching its authority. The company could remove barriers to rapid-fire passcode guessing by installing a software update, greatly cutting down the time it would take to access the phone, according to a blog post by Dan Guido, an adjunct professor at Polytechnic Institute of New York University and co-founder and CEO of Trail of Bits, a cybersecurity firm. Despite Cook’s concern that such assistance could create a backdoor to all iPhones, it is not clear whether the approach Apple takes to disable 5c encryption could likewise be applied to newer iPhones with better security. Apple introduced the 5c in September 2013 as a lower-cost alternative to its other models. The A7 processor introduced at the same time with the iPhone 5S included a “Secure Enclave” (pdf) coprocessor that provides security functions separate from the device’s main application processor. Secure Enclave introduced a two-key system to the iPhone that requires both that coprocessor and the main processor to approve a passcode before the device is unlocked and its data is decrypted. As Guido points out: “If the San Bernardino gunmen had used an iPhone with the Secure Enclave, then there is little to nothing that Apple or the FBI could have done to guess the passcode.” Apple bolstered security even further last year with iOS 9, which runs on iPhone models as old as the 4S and can erase iPhone data after 10 consecutive incorrect attempts to enter the passcode. Ultimately, Apple is most concerned about setting a precedent by fully cooperating in the San Bernardino case. If the company bypasses security in an older model iPhone, a judge who might not know the difference between security features of different models could compel Apple to do this again in the future, even if it may not be possible to break newer iPhone security, says Morgan Marquis-Boire, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab and former member of Google’s security team. “There’s the worry of the slippery slope” that might extend out to other devices as well as crimes in addition to terrorism, he adds. This last point is being tested in New York City, where U.S. law enforcement wants Apple to unlock an iPhone 5s belonging to an alleged methamphetamine dealer.

41,http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/whats-missing-from-the-german-cinema,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Richard Brody While spending several days in Berlin last week to take part in the Critics’ Week sidebar to the Berlin Film Festival, I took a few hours to make up for an omission of long standing. Back in 2012, I visited that city’s Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and wrote about the fact-free emptiness of the memorial’s array of black stelae. I found (and still find) its high-design tastefulness nonspecific and pristine, both shame-free and victimless. (Among the improvements I suggested were six million speed bumps scattered throughout the roads of Germany, both rendering memory constant and daring drivers to curse “the Jews” as they slowed down.) I later learned that, at the far edge of the array, there is a staircase leading down to a subterranean Information Center that fills in the historical background, and last week, when I took a short break from the movies, that’s where I went. And yet, somehow, I didn’t get far from the movies at all. The first part of the exhibit, the Foyer, is a sort of textual and visual chronology of the Holocaust, from 1933 to 1945, illustrated by a strip of images approximately a foot in height that are captioned to describe or contextualize the events. Some show the living (Jews being publicly humiliated by German officials, Jews being deported by train, Jews penned together in the Warsaw Ghetto, Jews being lined up in front of a pit, and—much later—Jews who have survived the atrocities), and some show the dead (the corpses in the pit where, moments earlier, people had been lined up; victims of heat and dehydration removed from a deportation train; victims of Bergen-Belsen being bulldozed into a mass grave after the camp was liberated). At the end of this chronological hall are portraits of six victims of the Holocaust—archival photographic closeups, blown up to about four feet in height, with a brief biographical sketch of each victim beneath the images. The proportions were off. First, the documentary images of Nazi crimes are too small for their captions. At such a small size, the photographs are turned into mere samples or swatches of history rather than its embodiment; they seem like illustrations of the captions rather than the focus of attention. Moreover, the well-intentioned humanistic focus on the individuality of the victims further draws attention away from the horror. Rather, they suggest a generic message of sympathetic decency beside which the horror of the archival photographs is minimized. Scale matters. If an image of corpses in a ditch had been reproduced at not one foot tall but eight—or as large as necessary for the dead to appear life-size—the Information Center would have risen above the merely informative to become an aptly monstrous avowal of monstrous crimes. Of course, to display photos of such size, the subterranean space would have to be as vast as the array of stelae—or, better, would have to take its place at street level. The adjoining room, the so-called Room of Dimensions, is the emotional and aesthetic core of the Information Center. It’s a darkened space featuring about a dozen texts from victims of the Holocaust—fragments of a diary written over the printed pages of a novel; another diary written on toilet paper; a final telegram from a Jewish man in Berlin to his family in England just before he committed suicide; a poem, on a scrap of paper, by Miklós Radnóti about a mass shooting that he survived; a memoir by Marcel Nadjary of what he observed as a member of a Sonderkommando in Auschwitz; a letter from a Jewish woman in Poland warning relatives that Jews were being deported not, as authorities claimed, to do work but to be murdered by poison gas. Each physical fragment of texts is reproduced twice, once at actual size and once in a large blow-up several feet wide, and the texts are transcribed and translated beside them, in German and English. Instead of being encyclopedia-style compendia of information, these texts are personal accounts of the Holocaust, the bearing of witness that simultaneously describes events and conjures the individuality of the writers. For that matter, the documents themselves are a physical form of witness, enduring fragments of the Holocaust. The Room of Dimensions isn’t just a collection of words: the combination of the life-size documents, the blow-ups for examination purposes, and the transcription beside them has the authority of images, transforms these texts into images. These first-person documents are the most powerful sources of information in the Information Center. The Room of Dimensions is, by far, the most imaginative memorial at the memorial; it would be better had the 4.7-acre site of the array of stelae been replaced instead with dozens, hundreds, thousands of such original texts by Jews who were murdered or survived the slaughter. The question of presenting memory and history isn’t one of responsibility and thoroughness, of supposed factual objectivity in lieu of emotional experience. On the contrary, it’s an aesthetic matter, a question of art. On Wednesday, I took part in the opening-night conference of Critics’ Week, with Charles Tesson, of the Cannes festival, and Sergio Fant, of the Locarno festival, in a discussion moderated by the critic Carmen Gray, about the current state of the German cinema. One thing we agreed on is the prevalence of bland, distinction-less historical dramas—mainly about the Holocaust, but also about the Cold War. (One such recent film is “Labyrinth of Lies.”) They’re not so much reëxaminations of history as the packaging of pre-programmed responses to it. They may, by the very nature of drama, be built from specific details, but their unquestioned naturalistic representation of history leads to a distancing of that history from the present day, and the standardized arc of these scrupulously professional dramas boils those details down to a familiar and empty ruefulness. The contemporary German cinema is of a piece with the Holocaust memorial, works of tastefulness and dignity that signify a collective national acknowledgment of the crimes of the past without incarnating the terrifying process of memory or the leaching of their revelations into the present day. They insulate the present from the past. On Friday night, a Critics’ Week screening of another new and yet-unreleased film, “Coma,” directed by Sara Fattahi, showed what’s missing from the German cinema. (I wrote notes on the screening for the Critics’ Week Web site. New Yorkers will soon be able to see for themselves: “Coma” will be shown next Sunday and Monday, Feb. 21 and Feb. 22, in MOMA’s Doc Fortnight series.) Fattahi (who does her own camera work) films (or, rather, records on digital video) her mother, her grandmother, and herself, in the family apartment in Damascus. And that, for the most part, is the movie—it’s the war in Syria, experienced by three generations of one family, mainly at home. Which is to say that it’s not a comprehensive view of the war, not a history of the war, not a visual documentation of battles or atrocities, not a rhetorical effort at advocacy. “Coma” is an incarnation of war in daily life, a mental image of war that is embodied in a repertory of actual images that don’t seem to be borrowed from the familiar realm of audiovisual communication but instead seem to be invented from the state of things, wrenched from the horror to incarnate the horror without depicting it expressly. Fattahi’s mother is divorced from a man—a Syrian officer—whom she was pressured to marry and regretted marrying, and who, while the three women live in fear and isolation in Damascus, does nothing to help. Fattahi’s grandmother, recently widowed, is still openly grieving. Fattahi herself misses her friends, with whom she communicates via e-mail, in scenes that render the pixels of her computer screen nearly alive with a tactile, grosgrain intimacy. In their near-carceral isolation, broken only by occasional errands—particularly a trip by Fattahi and her grandmother to her late grandfather’s grave—and visits from neighboring women for a remarkably vivid game of cards, the three women are visited by the Syrian past, in the form of home videos of popular movies from bygone years, of recordings of older generations’ popular songs. Fattahi’s selection of these clips is an ingenious curation, a form of cultural archeology that extracts from their modern-classic entertainments lines of dialogue and dramatic situations that reflect with a jolting precision the situation at hand, that come off as deep historical foreshadowings of the new conflict in the political and personal conflicts of the past—or, rather, the reflections of decades-long continuities of traumas and troubles. Private lives scarred by the political history that’s smothered in the past and the history that’s being made in the present (which Fattahi presents in local television and radio news reports as well as in hints and rumors that the women pick up and discuss) are probed and transfigured in images of haunted, premonitory intimacy. Fattahi is, on the basis of one film, one of the world’s most audacious cinematographers and image-composers. She devises urgently intimate closeups, oblique compositions, impressionistically out-of-focus shots, and exquisitely and ironically canny framings to wrest her family’s life in wartime away from familiar and unquestioned modes of representation and to render it as pure creation and mystery. An exquisitely, bitterly comical sequence of a couple on an amusement-park ride during a time of battle turns the screen into a mirror and the couple into reflections of the movie’s own spectators, who are looking at a distant war as if with a blank fun-house gaze. The subject of “Coma” is the very possibility and inadequacy of attempting to represent the war in a movie. “Coma” reminds me of the late Chantal Akerman’s “No Home Movie” (which played at the New York Film Festival last October), in which Akerman films her aged and ailing mother at the family apartment in Brussels and records their discussions about the traumas suffered by her parents and extended family during the Second World War (her mother was a survivor of Auschwitz). Even more, it reminds me stylistically of Akerman’s 2006 film about her visit to Israel, “Là-Bas” (Over There), in which Akerman remains in one sublet room and records the spectres of history and politics that haunt her. Like Akerman, Fattahi thinks in images, creates images that are themselves experiences, that don’t merely reflect history but become part of history by the mnemonic power of their own fiercely inventive style. All great political documentaries are radical acts of memory—works of imagination in which the past isn’t transparently accessible as a static archive but has to be re-created through ongoing and unresolved effort directed both toward the events and at one’s own experience of them. They’re works in which the filmmakers’ own standpoint and perception is integral to the process of reporting and documentation. At the opening-night conference of Critics’ Week, I responded to a fellow-panelist’s praise of German filmmakers’ effort to consider the country’s past with the charge that looking at the past is easier than looking at its present. What’s missing from the German cinema today is the power to film in the first person, to see the crimes of the past in the present tense, to admit that, in some inescapable way, they’re one’s own—or, for that matter, to declare brazenly that they’re not. But doing so isn’t only a matter of good will, of readiness to take on such moral risks; it’s a matter of artistic audacity that arises from a confrontation with the matter of the medium. For the most part, the German film industry displays a fundamental lack of aesthetic daring, of reconsideration of the physical and practical means of filmmaking. It’s burdened with an assembly-line system of financing and production into which each individual director’s scripts are plugged—with a lack of independence, both economic and artistic. Freely inventive creation brings its own politics, is inherently political, because it renews a viewer’s perception of the world. Filming herself and her family in an apartment, Sara Fattahi has made a great political film, not only because the subjects that they discuss are political but because her filmmaking is itself the invention of an original, personal, and transformative political way of seeing. Neither the German film industry nor its grand-scale commemorative urbanism is, at the moment, up to her level of achievement. France’s film industry has at least as much of a centralized administrative infrastructure as Germany’s, but France has maintained an unbroken string of artistic filiation, from the French New Wave through generations of artists that lead up to the present day, including Akerman, Philippe Garrel, Leos Carax, Bruno Dumont, Sophie Letourneur, Serge Bozon, Antonin Peretjatko, and others. Germany had its own New Wave in the nineteen-sixties and seventies, but Rainer Werner Fassbinder died in 1982, at the age of thirty-seven; Wim Wenders and Werner Herzog emigrated; and young German filmmakers are, in effect, orphans. Yet it’s one of the signal merits of the Berlin festival’s Critics’ Week programs to submit the present state of German cinema to discussion and scrutiny while also showing films that may provide the basis for a new artistic reconstruction. As the exemplary art of the age, the cinema can launch an intellectual and aesthetic reconstruction far beyond movies into the arts overall, including the art of public memorials. It’s easy to imagine a generation of daringly original filmmakers setting into motion an aesthetic sensibility, one sufficiently shared and collectively motivating to have superseded in advance the bland and blank refinement of the memorial’s array of stelae.

47,http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_29532597/nyc-police-criminals-say-apple-encryption-gift-from?source=rss,"Trending: NEW YORK — Police and prosecutors in New York City said Thursday that the top-notch encryption technology on Apple mobile phones is now routinely hindering criminal investigations. And they predicted the problem could grow worse as more criminals figure out how good the devices are at keeping secrets. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said at a news conference that 175 Apple devices are sitting in his cybercrime lab right now that investigators can’t access because of encryption embedded in the company’s latest operating systems. “They’re warrant proof,” he said, adding that the inability of investigators to peer inside the devices was especially problematic because so much evidence that used to be stored in file cabinets, on paper, and in vaults, is now only on criminals’ smartphones. Apple has marketed its encryption data as an important privacy tool, and the Cupertino-based company is currently fighting a federal magistrate’s order to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by a gunman in the mass shooting in San Bernardino. Vance didn’t specify which New York City cases were being hindered. But Police Commissioner William Bratton said a phone seized in the investigation of the shooting of two police officers in the Bronx is among those that detectives can’t crack. Bratton said criminals are increasingly aware of the protection offered by their devices. He said a prisoner in a city jail was recently recorded saying in a phone call that iPhone encryption was “another gift from God.” Vance said investigators often rely on phone data to investigate killings, child pornography, robbery and identity theft. He said that might include checking a suspect’s contact list to get the names of witnesses or conspirators, or viewing incriminating videos and photographs. In the California case, Apple CEO Tim Cook has warned that creating software allowing the FBI to unlock the San Bernardino suspect’s phone would create a backdoor that would make millions of other phones vulnerable to hackers and criminals. The company has also resisted on the grounds that, if forced by the courts to “hack our own users,” the government could be emboldened to force the company to build surveillance software to intercept all sorts of messages, “access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone’s microphone or camera without your knowledge.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2016-02-18 14:44:49,NYC police: Criminals say Apple encryption a 'gift from God',,35,http://www.mercurynews.com/
48,http://theweek.com/articles/606452/why-tim-cook-really-wont-unlock-that-iphone,"AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster Tim Cook just gave the FBI the middle finger. Or something close to it. Let's back up. One of the perpetrators of the December mass shooting in San Bernardino owned an iPhone. That iPhone is locked, and when an iPhone is locked, there's just no way to get inside it. Or, you know, maybe not. So, according to an open letter to customers by Apple CEO Tim Cook, published on the company's website, the FBI asked Apple to create, essentially, a new version of iOS, the operating system that runs iPhones and iPads, that includes what's known in technical terms as a ""backdoor,"" a secret master key that can give an unauthorized user control over the system. According to Apple, the FBI is trying to do this through an obscure law known as the All Writs Act of 1789. And Apple is refusing, because the corporate values at Apple don't allow this sort of thing to happen, at least not without a fight. The problems with the FBI's iOS demand are manifold. Basically, whoever has this backdoor could do anything with any iPhone on the planet. Get all the data on it, including sensitive material like your texts or your health information. Track your location. Listen to you via the microphone. And even if you think the feds should have this capacity, and the capacity to do it without a warrant, there is simply no way to guarantee they would be the only ones with it. Hackers find overlooked backdoors all the time. What happens when China hacks President Cruz's iPhone and listens in on Oval Office meetings? (If it's President Clinton it's fine; China already has her email. Rimshot!) Regardless of your views on civil liberties, a universal backdoor inside one of the most popular operating systems in the world is, for technological reasons, an atrocious idea. The security risks are enormous. It's no surprise that Mike Lee, one of the most conservative senators (and one of the very best), has come out against the idea. But Tim Cook didn't have to do this. Apple is now probably going to end up with a lawsuit. And it's going to have to have some unpleasant conversations with the government behind closed doors. Apple could have just complied with the FBI's request. And the downsides for Apple would have been small. Apple is now a mass-market company, and most people take something of an ignorance-is-bliss attitude toward mass surveillance. And, anyway, Apple could have said it had no choice. Since many in the media (like yours truly!) are opposed to mass surveillance, the company probably gets a small PR boost from this very public refusal, but that's nothing compared to the annoyance of having to deal with a fight with the feds. Countless companies have cooperated beyond legal requirements with government surveillance requests for these reasons, and others like it. It's just so difficult to refuse do to what the government asks. What's fascinating about this case is that Tim Cook's decision is directly related to Apple culture. At Apple Cook and his senior management work in an environment where defending civil liberties, and technological liberties, is an important value. And Apple's founder, Steve Jobs, instilled a workplace where Apple perpetuated values beyond company profits — mostly values having to do with design rather than legal issues or politics, but values nonetheless. This is the power of culture, whether national, international, or corporate. The stories we tell ourselves and the rituals we practice help shape our lives and influence our decisions. It is often thought that preserving civil liberties is a matter of having the right laws, and that is certainly important, but politics is downstream from culture. What helps laws matter, and what allows us to interpret and alter our laws, is culture, the social and personal environment that narrates our lives and our goals. If we want strong civil liberties — and if we want a flourishing civilization — we need to pay attention to cultural values, and not just laws. Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2021.

Gun control moms have held “stroller jam” protests at lawmakers’ offices and organized boycotts of supermarkets that allow customers to carry guns. Now, as college campuses have become a new battlefield in the American culture war over guns, a leading gun control group is trying to rally a new group of advocates: single women.  Cosmopolitan magazine has partnered with Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, to launch the “Singled Out” campaign, which includes a video of a young woman rolling her eyes as a “gunsplainer” hitting on her in a bar tells her that hammers are more dangerous than guns. “I take them with me everywhere,” the bearded man in the video says, flashing his guns. “The mall, the movies, the bouncy house at my nephew’s birthday party. You never know when there’s going to be a bad guy with a gun.” The campaign defines “gunsplainer” as “a man who repeatedly and condescendingly explains to a woman why she’d be safer if she had a gun”. Everytown urges young women to oppose efforts to allow guns on college campuses and to support laws that would “close the boyfriend loophole” and expand the category of domestic abusers who are barred from buying guns. At a panel discussion on Thursday in New York, the group highlighted the work of Jessica Jin, a 25-year-old University of Texas at Austin alumna who organized a “Campus (Dildo) Carry” protest in response to a new Texas state law that will permit concealed carry of guns on public university campuses. UT Austin’s president announced yesterday that concealed carry of guns would be allowed in classrooms, but not in on-campus dormitories, in “laboratories with extremely dangerous chemicals, biologic agents, or explosive agents”, or at sporting events. “I do not believe handguns belong on a university campus, so this decision has been the greatest challenge of my presidency to date,” the president, Gregory Fenves wrote in an open letter posted on the university website. The new state law to allow guns on campus will go into effect on 1 August. Last fall, as a joke, Jin created a Facebook event for a dildo carry day on 24 August, the first day of school, to protest the state of Texas’ decision “that it is not at all obnoxious to allow deadly concealed weapons in classrooms”. The “Cocks Not Glocks” event went viral, with more than 10,000 people currently RVSPing yes to the Facebook event. Jin said she has already received a donation of 500 dildos for the event from a porn company, and that another company from Singapore had promised to ship her 3,000 more. She is currently storing the dildos in a professor’s attic, she said, since she does not have room for them in her apartment. Jin said she has been the target of criticism from gun rights supporters, as well as some threats. “I think I struck a nerve with my protest,” Jin said. “These guys are a little mad at me. They’re trying to tell me, with a bunch of hot women showing up to UT with dildos in their hands, they’re inviting sexual assault, and if we get raped with our own dildos, we’ll wish we had a gun to protect us.” Some critics have brought up the possibility of another school shooting, she said, asking: “What are you going to do when another man who shall not be named walks into the classroom? Are you just going to masturbate in front of him while he shoots you in the head?” Jin, who called herself an “accidental activist”, said that the event had opened a door for young people to get involved in gun politics. “I feel like I’ve been passed this really important ball, and if I don’t run far enough with it, it would be irresponsible,” she said. The Everytown panel also highlighted recent reporting on guns and domestic violence. Investigations from the Associated Press and the Huffington Post have highlighted the toll of domestic violence-related shootings on women. The vast majority of America’s 33,000 annual gun death victims are men. Roughly 1,700 women were victims of gun homicides in 2014, representing about 16% of all gun homicide victims, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of gun homicide was about three times higher for black women than for white women. But amongst women, intimate partner violence is a primary cause of gun deaths. “In the United States, more women are killed by their intimate partners than by any other group of people,” the Huffington Post noted. A Huffington Post investigation found that at least 112 people were killed in “suspected intimate partner homicides” in January, a number that included bystanders and children caught up in the violence. The analysis found that 77% of the victims were women, and that 57% of the incidents involved firearms. An Associated Press analysis of crime data found that an average of 760 Americans are killed with guns each year by spouses, formers spouses or dating partners, and that the majority of victims are women, often current wives or girlfriends of the offender. Cosmopolitan urged readers to talk with their boyfriends about whether they owned guns, where they had bought them and whether they stored their weapons safely. “When I was dating, it never occurred to me to ask a guy if he owned a gun,” Joanna Coles, Cosmopolitan’s editor-in-chief, wrote in a March 2016 editor’s note about the Singled Out campaign, according to a press release. “But given the numbers – more than 8,700 women in the US were shot to death by their partner between 2000 and 2013 – it’s time to discuss what’s in your guy’s drawers, and I don’t mean his CK boxer briefs.” The Singled Out campaign’s website calls out three National Rifle Association affiliates that it dubs “gunsplainers”. Cam Edwards, who hosts the long-running NRA News show Cam & Company, is quoted as saying that: “If you’re the victim of a violent crime … the burden of stopping that assault is not going to be on the person committing that assault, not at that moment in time. The burden of stopping that assault is on the victim, it is on the victim.” In an article responding to the campaign, Edwards disputed the idea that his quote “amounts to victim blaming or victim shaming”. “Frankly, I’m still puzzled by their attempt to try and turn my statement into something controversial,” he wrote. “No matter your views on gun ownership, most people understand that if you’re the victim of a violent crime, the police aren’t going to be on scene to actually prevent that crime from taking place.” Single women are a key voting constituency for Democrats. Everytown spokeswoman Erika Soto Lamb said that the “Singled Out” education campaign might connect to the organization’s 2016 political advocacy work later this year. But, she said, “We’re not a partisan organization.” Everytown claims more than 3 million members, but does not track how many of its current members are mothers, versus how many are single women, she said.",2016-02-18 17:28:55,'Gunsplainers': gun control activists rally women to fight 'boyfriend loophole',"education and schools,politics and government,law and legislation,women,gun control,firearms,children and youth",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
51,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/138857598/0/phoenix/nation~Are-Android-phones-more-easily-hacked-than-iPhones/,"SAN FRANCISCO — If Syed Riswan Farook had carried a phone running on the Android or Windows operating system, the FBI may not have needed to ask anyone for help getting in — they could have done it on their own. Of the three main phone operating systems, only Apple builds the ability to have the phone erased after a certain number of failed passcode attempts into its operating system, security experts say. Apple's use of an ""Erase Data"" feature connected to passcodes is one of the security features that separates it from other smartphones on the market. That separation became a part of the national discussion Tuesday when a federal judge required Apple to create software to disable the feature that erases the data on the iPhone after 10 failed login attempts. The FBI wants to get past the feature in Farook's phone to see if there is information on it that will give the agency insight into the activities and actions that led up to the mass shooting attack by Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik in December. In a letter to customers posted on Apple's website, CEO Tim Cook says the company will fight the order, comparing the request to creating a ""back door"" on all iPhones. USA TODAY Facebook, Twitter side with Apple in iPhone fight Disabling Apple's ""Erase Data"" feature, which is what the FBI wants the company to do, would allow it to use a ""brute force"" attack, entering countless passcodes until they discovered the correct one, and gain access to the phone. The functionality can be added to Android and Windows phones, but it's difficult and meant for system administrators, not regular users, said Filip Chytrý, director of threat intelligence for Avast Software, a Prague-based computer security company. On an Android phone, “you are required to have a device administrator permission.” The user must get a special app, “you have follow extra steps, and it’s nothing the general user would have been able to do,” Chytrý said. USA TODAY iPhone-FBI dispute is Crypto Wars all over again: Voices For phones using the Windows operating system, special software must be downloaded, he said. Google, the creator of Android software, did not respond for a request for information for this report. Microsoft did not respond to a similar request. Apple is certainly ahead of the pack in terms of encryption capabilities,"" said Christopher Budd, global threat communications manager at security firm Trend Micro. Android does include a Remote Wipe option, where a user can remotely erase the contents of their smartphone. Third-party apps which bring this functionality to Android and Windows phones are readily available, but require extra work on the user's part as they’re not simply a built-in functionality that’s easily turned on. Encryption In encryption, the encoding of what's on the phone so it's not readable by anyone without the proper code keys, Apple is also ahead of the game. ""You see science-fiction and spy movies where someone sits down and bangs on a keyboard for 10 minutes and breaks encryption. You can’t do that,"" says Dan Schiappa, senior vice president and general manager at security firm Sophos. ""Unless you have somebody’s credentials — username and password — or the actual encryption key, there’s no way you can break it."" Apple has made encryption the default on its phones since the 3GS. Android only began making it the default with its most recent phone and Windows phones require extra steps to encrypt, said Chytrý. No backdoors These issues aside, none of the major manufacturers openly support backdoors into their customer’s devices, said Travis Smith, senior security researcher at Tripwire. ""In order to gain access to the device, a court-ordered warrant must be presented to attempt to access the device.  It’s up to the manufacturer to determine if or how to comply with the warrant,"" he said. USA TODAY Global profits at stake as Apple, tech fight U.S. on security Though there are caveats for Android users. While full disk encryption is now mandatory for new devices shipped with the Marshmallow (Android 6.0) operating system, for upgraded devices the encryption setting is still optional. And some low-cost Android phones may not support encryption, he said. Backdoors might, however, exist in phones sold elsewhere in the world, especially in countries with less legal protection for individual privacy. “Any electronic or telecommunications technology that is manufactured in China, or by any nation-state adversary, has the potential to have a backdoor built into it at the hardware layer,” said Chase Cunningham, director of threat intelligence with the security company Armor. That type of backdoor “is nearly impossible to detect and is far more powerful than any software. There are huge companies within China that work directly with their government, ensuring they can have direct access to user data,” he said.",2016-02-18 19:17:13,Are Android phones more easily hacked than iPhones?,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Dalton is suspected of using in a mass shooting spree, authorities said Sunday. The weapon, a semiautomatic handgun, was recovered from Dalton's Chevrolet HHR after a Kalamazoo County sheriff's deputy spotted him in the parking lot of a downtown bar and took Dalton into custody. In the hours before his arrest, Dalton is suspected of opening fire at three different locations in Kalamazoo County, killing six people and seriously injuring two others. Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said ATF agents are helping investigators from his agency, Michigan State Police and the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office pinpoint the origin and the history of the alleged murder weapon. Hadley said investigators also are working to determine if Dalton had any other guns in his possession at the time of the shooting rampage. Crime lab technicians and sheriff's deputies searched for evidence Sunday morning at Dalton's house at 7031 Douglas Avenue in Cooper Township. County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said Dalton fired approximately 30 or more rounds Saturday between the three shooting scenes. He said the shell casings found at each scene matched the caliber of the handgun police recovered from Dalton's car. Getting declined to say Sunday what caliber of gun was found in Dalton's car. ""The evidence at each of the scenes is consistent with each other and it's consistent with the evidence recovered but that doesn't necessarily mean it's all the same gun and MSP will be checking comparisons,"" Getting said. Police suspect Dalton's alleged shooting spree began at about 6 p.m. Saturday when he shot a woman multiple times in Richland Township. The woman, who police have not identified, is expected to survive. Four hours later, police said Dalton shot and 17-year-old and his father in the parking lot of Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive and then, at 10:15 p.m., shot four women and a 14-year-old girl in the parking  lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant on South Ninth Street at I-94. The two men shot at Seelye Automotive and the four women shot at the Cracker Barrel restaurant were killed. The 14-year-old girl was clinging to life Sunday at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo. Police have said it appears Dalton picked his victims at random during the shooting spree and that the shootings were unprovoked. Rex Hall Jr. is a reporter at MLive.com.

Mary Jo Nye taught English at Calhoun Community High School. The school's assistant director, Tara Egnatuk, said Nye was an integral part of the school's founding. Nye retired ""She became like a mother to a lot of kids,"" Egnatuk told the Enquirer. Police say Nye was the driver of a Chevrolet Cruze, who was killed along with Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, of Battle Creek, the rear driver-side passenger; and Barbara Hawthorne, 68, of Battle Creek, the rear, passenger-side passenger. Also killed was Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, Mich., the driver of a minivan. Jason Brian Dalton, 45, of Cooper Township, was arrested without incident at 12:40 a.m. Sunday after allegedly beginning a series of shootings that began at 5:42 p.m. Saturday. Police allege that he drove from place to place and shot a woman in Richland Township, two men at a Kalamazoo car dealership, and five at a restaurant in Texas Township. They believe he would have shot others if his vehicle had not been identified and stopped by a Kalamazoo County Sheriff's deputy. A 14-year-old front-seat passenger of the Chevrolet is in critical condition at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo. She was pronounced dead until she squeezed her mother's hand, police have said.

Dunn issued a letter to the campus community just after 3 p.m. Sunday in response to the criticism: To the Western Michigan University Campus Community: We're tremendously saddened by the senseless acts of violence that occurred Feb. 20 and join the wider Kalamazoo county community in its grief. I know that all of you join me in offering our condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims of this tragedy. In the aftermath of the terrible incidents, many have raised questions about why we did not issue a WMU Alert to inform our campus community about the unfolding tragedy. Frankly, as we review information now surfacing, I understand the concern and respect the input. Our WMU Alert system is set up to comply with the Clery Act and, as such, warn members of the WMU community of the existence of a credible threat to our campus and the people on it. Saturday's events occurred in three different county communities over a period of hours. It was 11:30 p.m. before our public safety officials were told the shootings were linked. Our public safety chief was on his way to an inter-agency briefing when the suspect was taken into custody at 12:40 a.m. Two of the three incidents happened miles from the campus, and while these incidents were not linked until very late in the timeline, we need to make adjustments in our own procedures to respond to extraordinary circumstances. Last night's incident clearly was one. We are looking carefully at our guidelines and the possibility of developing a public safety advisory covering a broader array of safety issues. We're also exploring more effective ways to use social media. Clearly, we failed last night to provide adequate information and updates. We look forward to working with our student leaders, faculty and the University community to be much more responsive to the need for information and communication.  To that end, I have scheduled a universitywide forum for 7 p.m. Monday in the East Ballroom of the Bernhard Center to provide information, respond to questions and seek additional input. This is a community committed to learning, and we will learn from this incident and improve our campus alert measures moving forward. Dr. John M.

59,http://www.mercurynews.com/drive/ci_29548465/uber-responds-michigan-shooting?source=rss,"Trending: As an Uber driver was charged Monday in a Michigan mass shooting that left six dead, the ride-hailing service went on the defensive and said its driver-vetting standards would not change. Uber confirmed the man named in the deaths, 45-year-old Jason Dalton, was driving for the company the day of the shootings. Several passengers contacted Uber to complain about his driving that violent Saturday, including one who called Dalton’s behavior dangerous and erratic and reported it to 911, Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan said during a Monday afternoon media call. But the San Francisco-based company said Dalton had passed Uber’s background check and had done nothing before then to cause alarm. The media call, organized to deal with the bombardment of questions Uber has faced since six people were gunned down and two others injured Saturday night in Kalamazoo, illustrates that for Uber, this is about more than one driver and the tragic aftermath of his rampage. The controversial ride-hailing service, which at $51 billion is listed as the world’s most valuable private company by CB Insights, has long faced attacks over its safety policies. Uber agreed to pay $28.5 million less than two weeks ago to settle claims that it misled customers about the adequacy of its background checks, and the company faces several lawsuits by women who claim they were assaulted by Uber drivers. “It’s every corporation’s worst nightmare,” Margaret Richardson, an attorney at Covington & Burling who serves on Uber’s Safety Advisory Board, said of Saturday’s shootings. She spoke during Monday’s call. Authorities are investigating claims that Dalton picked up and dropped off passengers between the shootings at an apartment complex, a car dealership and a Cracker Barrel restaurant, 1st Lt. Dale Hinz of the Michigan State Police said in an interview with this newspaper. Sullivan wouldn’t divulge how many riders complained about Dalton, when Uber received those complaints, or how the company responded. But rider Matt Mellen told WWMT-TV in Kalamazoo that Dalton picked him up before the rampage and was driving erratically and running stop signs until Mellen jumped out of the car and ran. “We are horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence in Kalamazoo, Michigan,” Sullivan wrote in a statement the day after the attacks. “We have reached out to the police to help with their investigation in any way that we can.” Dalton had no prior criminal history, and there appears to be nothing Uber could have done to keep him off the road or prevent Saturday’s attacks, Hinz said. Sullivan echoed that sentiment, stressing that Dalton had passed Uber’s driver background check without raising red flags. Dalton had been an Uber driver for about a month, Sullivan said, and had given more than 100 rides. He had a good passenger rating — 4.73 stars out of 5. But in the wake of the shooting, Uber critics have attacked the company for being lax on passenger safety. Uber uses private San Francisco-based company Checkr to conduct background checks on its drivers, which Sullivan says includes checking the county courthouses in every place the driver has lived for the past seven years. If the records aren’t online, Uber dispatches someone to the courthouse in person, he said. “As it stands right now, the system that Uber has is extremely safe,” said retired Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, a member of Uber’s Safety Advisory Board who was on Monday’s call. But unlike most California taxi drivers, Uber drivers aren’t subject to government fingerprint checks, which Dave Sutton of taxi industry-backed campaign Who’s Driving You views as a problem. Uber’s checks can’t catch someone who is signing up for the platform under a false name, he said, and they don’t reveal as much information as a government check. Uber also doesn’t meet its potential drivers face to face during the screening process, a step Sutton says is important. “You get a chance to say whether you’re getting kind of an off vibe or not,” he said, “whether the person seems normal or whether there seems something off about them.” Richardson said fingerprint screenings are no more accurate than Uber’s checks and can wrongly disqualify drivers who were arrested but didn’t have charges filed. “I don’t think that we will be changing our screening processes for on-boarding our driver partners as a result of this incident,” Sullivan said, adding that Uber continues to improve its safety technology, such as its GPS tracking system that lets passengers share their location in real time. For Harry Campbell, an Uber driver and blogger on http://therideshareguy.com, the fact that passengers complained about Dalton was disconcerting. “I think it kind of speaks to the larger aspect that it’s very difficult to get a hold of Uber in person,” he said. “And when you do get a hold of someone over email or over chat, they’re often not very well-trained and not very helpful.” Marisa Kendall covers startups and venture capital.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. SAN FRANCISCO – As authorities look for the reasons why a Michigan man allegedly embarked on a mass shooting spree over the weekend, the ride-hailing service Uber is addressing his record as a driver with the company. Critics say the episode could bring more attention to concerns about the fast-growing service, which has been dogged by controversy on the road to becoming one of the most valuable privately funded companies in the world. Jason Dalton, the man arrested in connection with the Kalamazoo rampage that left six people dead, is a former insurance adjuster who had been working as a driver for Uber's ride-hailing service. Authorities were investigating unconfirmed reports he may have picked up passengers in the hours before and after the rampage on Saturday. San Francisco-based Uber has been one of the most successful tech industry startups in recent years, as millions of customers have flocked to use its smartphone app for hailing rides in 380 cities around the globe. The company says its drivers are independent contractors who use the app to help find customers and schedule trips. Private backers have poured more than $10 billion into the company, under terms that value the business at more than $50 billion — making it the biggest in a recent wave of tech firms that have grown to enormous size without taking the traditional step of selling stock to the public. But since its launch in 2009, Uber has faced criticism for a pricing formula that can send rates skyrocketing at times of high demand, and for side-stepping regulators and licensing requirements in some cities where it's opened for business. And after several reported assaults by drivers, critics have also complained the company should do more to screen drivers and guard passengers' safety. Some of that criticism has been raised by competitors and regulators who argue that Uber's success has come as the company has expanded while seeking to avoid the strict licensing and permit requirements that traditional tax companies face. ""I do think this is an outrageous incident that's going to draw more attention to this issue,"" said Dave Sutton, spokesman for ""Who's Driving You,"" an organization backed by Uber's competitors in the taxi and limousine industry, which has fought the company's expansion. Authorities identified Dalton as a 45-year-old from Kalamazoo Township who police said had no criminal record. They said victims of the shootings in and around the city of Kalamazoo had no apparent connection to him or to each other. Uber spokeswoman Nairi Hourdajian confirmed Dalton had driven for Uber. Hourdajian wouldn't say whether he was picking up fares for the ride-sharing service Saturday night. Authorities, however, were investigating a Facebook post which indicated the suspect was driving erratically around the time of the shootings and may have picked up at least one Uber fare while authorities were looking for him, according to Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting. Uber said Sunday that it has offered to assist authorities in their investigation. In a statement, Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan said the company is ""horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence."" While Uber says it screens drivers and conducts background checks, critics say the ride-hailing company uses private screening services that don't have access to as much information as local police can obtain when they check fingerprint records. The company said earlier this month that it will pay $28.5 million to settle two lawsuits that alleged Uber misled customers about safety procedures and fees. It's also facing a separate a lawsuit by district attorneys in San Francisco and Los Angeles, who alleged that Uber's checks failed to prevent the company from hiring several felons. If Dalton had no criminal record, it's not clear that Uber would have had any reason to keep him from driving. Uber, meanwhile, instituted a policy last year that prohibits driver and passengers from possessing firearms. Anyone found to be in violation of the policy may be prohibited from using or driving for the service. While there have been several cases in which Uber drivers have been charged with assaulting passengers, there have also been incidents in which the company's drivers have been attacked by passengers. Uber has also faced complaints that one of its executives in New York used information collected by the Uber app to track a passenger's movements. The company has since said that it has taken steps to protect passenger's privacy, including strict limits on access to the identities of riders.

She and others called on lawmakers to do something to stop gun violence. ""Kalamazoo is a beautiful, beloved city in Michigan. People in America must be able to shop for cars, dine and enjoy their city on a balmy Saturday night without fearing the worst,"" said Linda Brundage, executive director of the Michigan Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence. She called the gunman moving from one location to the next, shooting and killing people along the way on Saturday, Feb. 20, ""every community's greatest fear and nightmare."" Related: Complete coverage of Kalamazoo mass shootings Linda Brundage Brundage urged citizens to demand that lawmakers keep guns out of ""dangerous hands."" ""Too often, the response from our lawmakers is simply to provide thoughts and prayers,"" Brundage said. ""While we do pray for these innocents, we must also honor their lives with additional action."" Current gun laws in Michigan aren't sufficient to stop horrific events, she said. ""People of Michigan should ask themselves -- when are lawmakers going to do something about the reckless availability of firearms in our communities?"" Brundage said. ""Why aren't there better safeguards to protect our families and our rights? Why do lawmakers continue to pander to the profit seeking motives of the gun lobby and gun manufacturers?"" Kalamazoo County resident Marti Ulmer, volunteer with the Michigan Chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, also encouraged citizens to demand lawmakers keep their communities safe. ""We don't expect this type of violence to happen here in Kalamazoo, but the truth is that gun violence is affecting communities across the country every day,"" she said in a prepared statement. ""It does not have to be like this. We need to come together as a community to heal and take action. ""We must demand our Michigan lawmakers do more to keep our communities safe. I encourage other Kalamazoo residents who are angered by what happened last night to get involved -- we all can do more to reduce gun violence."" Gov. Rick Snyder ordered flags be flown at half staff for six days beginning Monday, Feb. 22, ""as a mark of respect"" for the six victims. Police said Jason Brian Dalton's shooting spree began at about 6 p.m. Saturday when he shot a woman multiple times in Richland Township. She is expected to survive. Four hours later, Dalton, an Uber driver, shot Tyler Smith, a 17-year-old Mattawan High School senior, and his father, Rich, in the parking lot of Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive, police said. The gunman then shot four women and a 14-year-old girl in the parking lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant on South Ninth Street at I-94. The two men shot at Seelye Automotive and the four women shot at the Cracker Barrel restaurant were killed. The 14-year-old girl was clinging to life Sunday at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo. Police have said it appears Dalton picked his victims at random and the shootings were unprovoked. Agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are assisting Kalamazoo police to learn more about the gun, a semi-automatic handgun, they suspect was used in the killings. Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said ATF agents are helping investigators from his agency, Michigan State Police and the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office pinpoint the origin and the history of the alleged murder weapon.

KALAMAZOO, MI -- Kalamazoo Mayor Bobby Hopewell said Monday Kalamazoo is a place that some believe might have been insulated from events like the mass shooting that happened here Saturday. ""Our world has become a little smaller because someone decided to attempt to hurt us as a community,"" Hopewell said to a crowd of hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil. ""Tonight is a demonstration that he can't do that, that we can feel the pain but can move beyond the pain."" Hundreds of people gathered Monday evening for a candlelight vigil that started at First Congregational Church in downtown Kalamazoo and spilled onto Bronson Park. The Rev. Sara Dorrien-Christians, pastor of Pine Island Church in Kalamazoo, said local leaders organized the vigil in response for calls from the community to come together. The vigil was organized by Frist COngregational Church, Coalition for Common Ground, Michigan Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence and concerned local clergy. ""I'd like to offer my deepest condolences to the victims' family and friends,"" Dorrien-Christians said at the opening of the vigil. In all, six people were killed and two were injured when, police say, a man went on a shooting spree across Kalamazoo County, seemingly picking his victims at random. The man, Jason Brian Dalton, was charged Monday with six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight counts of felony firearm use. Authorities have said his actions were random acts of violence. Kalamazoo is not a perfect place, but is a community that would remember its victims, Hopewell said at the vigil. He said attendees must remember and must come together ""beyond the moment of loss and be about the moment of opportunity."" Those who gathered at the church held hands and sang hymns. They hugged each other and wiped tears as they remembered the six victims of Saturday's mass shootings. Charlae Davis, executive director of ISAAC, said the community acknowledges the emotions of being saddened, feeling grief, fear, mistrust, powerlessness and pain. ""We are brothers, we are sisters, we are family members in this community,"" Davis said. After gathering at the church and hearing from local faith leaders and praying, attendees filed out into Bronson Park, where they lit candles and sang several songs, including ""We Shall Overcome.""

Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley confirmed Tuesday that the 9 mm semiautomatic handgun police found in Dalton's possession following his arrest Sunday was owned legally. The information from Hadley came just a few hours after Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Pali Matyas confirmed that Dalton, 45, of Cooper Township, did not have a license to carry a concealed weapon. The new information released Tuesday answered two of several questions that have swirled since Dalton's arrest for the shooting spree, which also seriously injured two people, including a 14-year-old girl. Dalton is being held in the Kalamazoo County Jail. He was arraigned Monday on six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight counts of felony firearm use. Detectives who obtained an arrest warrant for Dalton prior to his arraignment said Dalton admitted to fatally shooting a father and son from Mattawan at 10:08 p.m. in the parking lot of Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive. He also admitted to being at the scene of a shooting at 10:24 p.m. at a Cracker Barrel restaurant a few miles from there, where four women were killed and a 14-year-old girl was critically injured. Additionally, detectives said Tiana Carruthers, who was shot multiple times outside The Meadows townhomes on East G Avenue in Richland Township at 5:42 p.m. Saturday, later identified Dalton in a police lineup as the man who shot her. The detectives' testimony Monday shed no light on why Dalton, who did not have a criminal history, allegedly went on the shooting rampage and Dalton provided no clues when he was in court. Getting also said Monday that investigators do not know Dalton's motive. After the shooting in Richland Township, the next round of gunfire came after 10 p.m. when police say Dalton shot and killed 17-year-old Tyler Smith, of Mattawan, and Tyler's father, Rich Smith, 53. A little more than 15 minutes later, police say, Dalton shot and killed Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, and Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74; Barbara Hawthorne, 68, and Mary Jo Nye, 60 in the Cracker Barrel parking lot. Abigail Kopf, 14, was also wounded in the shooting at the Cracker Barrel. She was listed in critical condition at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo following the shooting. On Monday, Abigail's parents, Gene and Vicki, said their daughter is ""fighting for her life."" Rex Hall Jr. is a reporter for MLive.com. You can reach him at rhall2@mlive.com. Follow him on Twitter.

Jason Dalton, the man arrested in connection with the Kalamazoo rampage that left six people dead, is a former insurance adjuster who had been working as a driver for Uber's ride-hailing service. Authorities were investigating unconfirmed reports he may have picked up passengers in the hours before and after the rampage on Saturday. San Francisco-based Uber has been one of the most successful tech industry startups in recent years, as millions of customers have flocked to use its smartphone app for hailing rides in 380 cities around the globe. The company says its drivers are independent contractors who use the app to help find customers and schedule trips. Private backers have poured more than $10 billion into the company, under terms that value the business at more than $50 billion — making it the biggest in a recent wave of tech firms that have grown to enormous size without taking the traditional step of selling stock to the public. But since its launch in 2009, Uber has faced criticism for a pricing formula that can send rates skyrocketing at times of high demand, and for side-stepping regulators and licensing requirements in some cities where it's opened for business. And after several reported assaults by drivers, critics have also complained the company should do more to screen drivers and guard passengers' safety. Some of that criticism has been raised by competitors and regulators who argue that Uber's success has come as the company has expanded while seeking to avoid the strict licensing and permit requirements that traditional tax companies face. ""I do think this is an outrageous incident that's going to draw more attention to this issue,"" said Dave Sutton, spokesman for ""Who's Driving You,"" an organization backed by Uber's competitors in the taxi and limousine industry, which has fought the company's expansion. Authorities identified Dalton as a 45-year-old from Kalamazoo Township who police said had no criminal record. They said victims of the shootings in and around the city of Kalamazoo had no apparent connection to him or to each other. Uber spokeswoman Nairi Hourdajian confirmed Dalton had driven for Uber. Hourdajian wouldn't say whether he was picking up fares for the ride-sharing service Saturday night. Authorities, however, were investigating a Facebook post which indicated the suspect was driving erratically around the time of the shootings and may have picked up at least one Uber fare while authorities were looking for him, according to Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting. Uber said Sunday that it has offered to assist authorities in their investigation. In a statement, Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan said the company is ""horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence."" While Uber says it screens drivers and conducts background checks, critics say the ride-hailing company uses private screening services that don't have access to as much information as local police can obtain when they check fingerprint records. The company said earlier this month that it will pay $28.5 million to settle two lawsuits that alleged Uber misled customers about safety procedures and fees. It's also facing a separate a lawsuit by district attorneys in San Francisco and Los Angeles, who alleged that Uber's checks failed to prevent the company from hiring several felons. Safety has been a key element of the taxi industry's campaign to slow the expansion of Uber and other ride-hailing companies, reports The Christian Science Monitor. But riders have mixed reviews of safety. “As a female, I like that it’s GPS tracked,” says Ceara Nation, an administrative assistant with CVS headquarters in Providence, R.I.. “Anytime you get into the car with a stranger there’s a risk there, but [if something happened] there would be a way to find you.” “Who’s Driving You?” has taken aim at Uber’s background checks, charging that the company’s screening easily allows convicted felons to slip through the cracks. “Uber does not submit to regulations, so they cannot use background checks that use FBI fingerprinting,” says Dave Sutton, spokesman for the “Who’s Driving You?” campaign, based in Washington. Launched last year, “Who’s Driving You” is a marketing effort funded by the Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association, which counts 1,100 licensed transportation companies among its members. “They use private companies and cheaper background checks that are not as comprehensive.” But Uber spokesman Lane Kasselman calls such accusations “scare tactics,” by rich, multinational corporations. “Instead of improving customer service they’re complaining about opposition,” he says. “The taxi industry has decided to play dirty politics instead of compete.” Uber’s criminal background checks, Mr. Kasselman says, are as comprehensive as the law allows for business purposes. If Dalton had no criminal record, it's not clear that Uber would have had any reason to keep him from driving. Uber, meanwhile, instituted a policy last year that prohibits driver and passengers from possessing firearms. Anyone found to be in violation of the policy may be prohibited from using or driving for the service. While there have been several cases in which Uber drivers have been charged with assaulting passengers, there have also been incidents in which the company's drivers have been attacked by passengers. Uber has also faced complaints that one of its executives in New York used information collected by the Uber app to track a passenger's movements. The company has since said that it has taken steps to protect passenger's privacy, including strict limits on access to the identities of riders. Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives.

73,http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentaries/369888441.html,"In the past week, there has been much talk of whether Apple should help the FBI gain access to a smartphone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. At stake is whether we are willing to sacrifice some of our freedom for some security. In the past when the question was about guns, our answer has been a resounding no. Now that the question is about our privacy, there seem to be a lot of people saying yes. On “The McLaughlin Group” last weekend, Pat Buchanan cited a Latin phrase “salus populi suprema lex,” meaning “the safety of the people is the highest law.” He doesn’t say that when it comes to guns. In other words: We will not give up our freedom to easily access weapons of war for the sake of safety, but we might be open to giving up our privacy. If part of what the FBI wants to find in that phone is how the shooters got the guns, it need look no further than a Wal-Mart or a gun show. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant knows that this is where to get guns, and it tells its followers as much. Easy access to guns is the Trojan horse of our time. ISIL didn’t have to send a shooter. It didn’t even have to provide the guns: Our own laws did that. And the next victim of these misguided laws may well be our privacy. Why is it that the ability of gun manufacturers to sell weapons of war is held sacred, while our own privacy is considered negotiable? I wonder if the next time there is a mass shooting in this country (and there will be more), we will be willing to look at the easy access to guns that makes these shootings so commonplace, rather than searching for other freedoms we might be willing to give up instead. Something has to give. After all: “salus populi suprema lex.”  Jesse Zettel, of Minneapolis, is a project manager. © 2021 StarTribune.

74,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/feb/23/victims-support-fbi-over-apple-20160223/,"WASHINGTON -- Some victims and affected families in a mass shooting in Southern California will file court papers in support of a U.S. magistrate judge's order that Apple Inc. help the FBI hack into a locked iPhone as part of the terrorism investigation, a lawyer and others said Monday. The dispute between the Justice Department and Apple continued Monday as the tech giant called on the government to withdraw its demands for help in unlocking a phone used by one of the shooters in December's terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and, instead, let a commission of experts discuss the issue. A Los Angeles attorney, Stephen Larson, said he represents several families of victims and others who were affected by the San Bernardino attack. He said the U.S. attorney in the case, Eileen Decker, sought his help. Larson said he will file a brief supporting the Justice Department before March 3. The victims ""have questions that go simply beyond the criminal investigation ... in terms of why this happened, how this happened, why they were targeted, is there anything about them on the iPhone -- things that are more of a personal victim"" view, Larson said. George Velasco, whose 27-year-old niece Yvette Velasco was killed in the shooting, said his brother -- Yvette's father -- agreed to be named in the brief. ""Frankly, it's difficult to understand why Apple would not jump at the opportunity to help uncover whatever information the phone may contain,"" a family statement said. ""We're not talking about an ordinary case here -- this is an act of terrorism, where 14 Americans lost their lives, and many more were seriously injured. It's potentially a matter of national security, where other Americans' safety could be at risk."" The case has sparked a debate over digital-privacy rights and national security interests. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym in California ordered Apple last week to assist investigators by creating specialized software that would let the FBI rapidly test random pass-code combinations to try to unlock the iPhone and view data stored on it. The county-issued iPhone 5C was used by Syed Farook, who with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people at an office holiday party in December before the couple died in a gunbattle with police. The government said the couple had been inspired by the Islamic State group. Farook had worked as a San Bernardino County health inspector. Larson said the government has a strong case because of Farook's diminished privacy interests as a ""dead, murderous terrorist"" and because the phone was owned by his employer, the county government. ""You're weighing that against the interest of enforcement in an investigation and the victims and their interest in obtaining this knowledge,"" he said. Apple requested the government's withdrawal Monday in an unsigned letter posted online that offered the company's perspective on the debate. Apple urged the Justice Department to drop its request and instead ""form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology, and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy, and personal freedoms."" Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook acknowledged in a letter to employees earlier Monday that ""it does not feel right"" to refuse to help the FBI, but he said the company's assistance would threaten data security for millions by creating a master key that could later be duplicated and used against other phones. ""We have no tolerance or sympathy for terrorists,"" Cook wrote in an email. ""When they commit unspeakable acts like the tragic attacks in San Bernardino, we work to help the authorities pursue justice for the victims."" Cook's email came hours after FBI Director James Comey said in an online post that Apple owes it to the San Bernardino victims to cooperate and that the FBI ""can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead."" Comey said the FBI is resorting to the courts to force Apple to unlock the iPhone not to ""set a precedent or send any kind of message"" but to conduct a complete investigation. ""I hope folks will take a deep breath and stop saying the world is ending, but instead use that breath to talk to each other,"" Comey said. Apple's supporters planned to protest the FBI's demands this evening outside Apple's stories in about 50 cities in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Hong Kong. In Washington, people were being asked to protest outside the FBI's headquarters. Prosecutors said Apple had previously helped federal law enforcement agents extract information from iPhones in criminal investigations at least 70 times over seven years before expressing concerns last fall during a drug case in New York. Asked to help break into the phone of a suspected methamphetamine dealer, Apple refused to cooperate. ""Public sensitivity to issues regarding digital privacy and security is at an unprecedented level,"" the company's lawyers said in a court filing. Forcing Apple to extract the data, they said, ""could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand."" Even after the defendant in the drug case, Jun Feng, pleaded guilty in October, Apple and the Justice Department lawyers told the court in that case that they still wanted a ruling. The issue wasn't just that phone, they wrote, but the millions of other Apple devices with even tougher encryption technology that might someday be seized in a criminal case. At an October court hearing, Apple attorney Marc Zwillinger said the company feared the government would try ""pushing the law to a new frontier"" by forcing the company to modify software or change its products. ""We're being forced to become an agent of law enforcement, and we cannot be forced to do that with our old devices or with our new devices,"" he said. A decision still hadn't come in the New York case when it was overtaken by the California one.

75,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/139855812/0/phoenix/nation~Cruz-outraises-Rubio-in-Super-Tuesday-states/,"WASHINGTON — In their battle to become Donald Trump’s chief rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has held one big advantage over Florida Sen. Marco Rubio: money. Cruz entered this month with $13.6 million in available cash, more than twice the amount stockpiled in Rubio’s account, new reports show. More than 40% of Cruz’s January donations came from small donors he can tap repeatedly for contributions, compared with 19% of Rubio’s contributions. But in perhaps the strongest measure of Cruz’s outreach to early voting states, the Texas senator outraised Rubio in the 11 states that will stage Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses next week, a USA TODAY analysis of new campaign-finance reports shows. In January, Cruz collected more than $1.8 million from these states, many of them clustered in the South. By comparison, donors from those states gave less than half that amount — about $774,000 — to Rubio’s campaign last month. Over the entire election cycle, Cruz has raised more than three times the amount that Rubio has collected from the March 1 states. Cruz vastly outperformed Rubio in his donor-rich home state of Texas, which accounted for more than two-thirds of the money Cruz raised in January from the Super Tuesday states. But he also raised more money than Rubio in seven others, including Tennessee, Oklahoma and Georgia — all with the sizable populations of the evangelical voters Cruz has courted assiduously in his White House quest. John Campbell, a retired homebuilder from Cumming, Ga., is among the devout supporting Cruz with campaign money. His small donations, $25 or $50 at a time, had added up to $1,030 by the end of January, election filings show. “This country is in serious trouble,” said Campbell, 81. “I’m a Christian, and I believe Sen. Cruz is the absolutely right person for this time.” The Rubio and Cruz camps are in all-out-warfare as the GOP contest hurtles toward March 1, when nearly a quarter of all the delegates in the nomination battle are up for grabs. One sign of the high stakes: Cruz fired his chief spokesman Rick Tyler on Monday for spreading a misleading video on social media that inaccurately showed Rubio disparaging the Bible. Rubio and Trump quickly sought to use the episode to drive home their long-standing assertions that Cruz has used underhanded tactics to gain an advantage in the campaign. (Rubio’s camp praised Tyler and said he had the “unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected.”) Campbell said the “liar tag that Trump and Rubio have put on him” has complicated matters for Cruz, but won’t deter from him from backing the Texas senator Tuesday. “I don’t know whether he’ll be able to recover or not. It’s in the hands of the Lord, as far as I’m concerned."" USA TODAY Ted Cruz fires spokesman over Rubio flap “Cruz has strong support across the Super Tuesday states based on many metrics, not the least of which is money raised,"" Cruz spokeswoman Alice Stewart said in an email. “Voters know he is the viable conservative who can win.” Cruz’s early fundraising advantage in the March 1 states is no guarantee of electoral success, however. New filings, for instance, show Trump using his fortune to begin building a more extensive political operation. The real-estate magnate's campaign plowed $11.5 million into the presidential contest in January, its most aggressive spending of the campaign. Trump also started the primary season with more paid campaign staffers than either Rubio or Cruz and had built a network of 17 paid field consultants stretching from Alabama to Ohio, an Associated Press review of his spending shows. Further complicating Cruz’s path to the nomination: Trump’s victory and Rubio’s second-place showing in Saturday's South Carolina primary — where Cruz had pursued the support of religious conservatives. Exit polls show 72% of those who voted in the Palmetto State’s primary considered themselves evangelicals, but more of them — 33% to 27% — backed Trump over Cruz. “Evangelical Christians are not single-issue voters, necessarily,” said Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. “Trump is definitely defending a lot of the things they like to hear defended — American interests, patriotism, nationalism.” Rubio campaign aides say their financial picture grew much brighter this month. Rubio's stronger-than-expected finish in South Carolina and Jeb Bush's exit have helped Rubio snap up big-name endorsements and Bush donors at a rapid clip. USA TODAY Marco Rubio doesn't need an outright win ... for now ""Fundraising is through the roof in recent days,"" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said in an email. The campaign has not released specific numbers, and officials don't have to disclose details on February contributions until March 20. The USA TODAY analysis shows Rubio outperforming Cruz last month in three states that vote on Super Tuesday: Minnesota, Massachusetts and the presidential swing state of Virginia, where many of his January contributions came from suburbs close to the nation's capital. The analysis examined donations larger than $200. Campaigns aren’t required to disclose donors' names and addresses for contributions that do not meet that threshold.",2016-02-23 20:26:46,Cruz outraises Rubio in Super Tuesday states,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

""My daughter is not dead,"" her mother, Vicki Kopf, said Monday night. ""She is alive and she is fighting for her life. I want everybody to understand that. Abigail is strong and she is a vibrant, beautiful, young lady. And she did not deserve this. And neither did her grandmother or those other victims."" Abigail's parents, Gene and Vicki Kopf of Battle Creek, and Bronson Children's Hospital Medical Director Dr. Aaron Lane-Davies talked with local news media Monday night at Bronson Children's Hospital in downtown Kalamazoo. The Kopfs said they have been by Abigail's bedside since this weekend. Lane-Davies declined to go into detail about Abigail's treatment and current status, only saying she remained on a ventilator and in critical condition. While her heart stopped and hospital officials had made contact with the organ and tissue donation program Gift of Life, he said, she never was declared medically brain-dead. Vicki Kopf said Abigail has squeezed hands and is trying to squeeze with both her arms. She's also wiggling her toes, she said. ""In spite of the seriousness of injuries we are encouraged by her relative stability over the last several days and her responsiveness to her parents and our team,"" Lane-Davies said. The 14-year-old girl is the lone survivor of those who were killed while sitting in a car at the Cracker Barrel restaurant in Texas Township. The three other occupants, all from Battle Creek — Mary Jo Nye, 60; Barbara Hawthorne, 68; and Dorothy Brown, 74, also known as Judy Brown — were killed. Mary Lou Nye, 62, who was in another car, was also killed at the restaurant. Lt. Dale Hinz of the Michigan State Police said the girl was shot once in the head. Vicki Kopf said the women were friends of their family. Hawthorne, known as ""Grandma Barb,"" was a grandmother figure to Abigail, despite not being related by blood. They had done things together ""ever since she was a baby,"" Vicki Kopf said, and began attending musicals together when she got older. Hawthorne had an infectious laugh and ""gave wonderful hugs,"" Vicki Kopf said. ""She is not of blood relation, she is just very close to the family,"" she said. ""She was with us when Abigail was born and she is basically her adopted grandmother. She took both my girls under her wing and has basically raised them both with us."" A total of six people were killed and two others were injured in a series of random shootings in Kalamazoo County Saturday night. Police said the attack at the Cracker Barrel restaurant was the last of a series of random shootings by 45-year-old Jason Dalton. He also shot and injured a woman at an apartment complex, and killed two at a car dealership, authorities said. He was working as an Uber driver that night. ""Our thoughts are with the Dalton family who also are suffering at this time,"" Gene Kopf read from a statement Monday night. ""We want his family to know that we don't hold anything against the family members."" Dalton was arraigned Monday on six counts of open murder, two counts of assault with intent to murder and eight counts of felony firearm. Police said in a preceding probable-cause hearing he admitted ""he took people's lives."" The Kopfs continued to ask for their family's privacy Monday night, saying Abigail's 6-year-old sister still doesn't know ""what has happened to her sister in full detail."" ""We also know Abigail is going to have a very tough road to recovery,"" Gene Kopf said, ""which is another reason we didn't want her to be under scrutiny or limelight when she is recovering. It's tough enough being a 14-year-old girl and everything is going well — adding that is hard to comprehend.""

It would make horrific shootings more likely Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.18 BST My home state of Michigan – the state that I love – is also home to two of the deadliest cities in the country: Detroit, which consistently ranks among the worst cities in the nation for its gun homicide rate; and Flint, which consistently has one of the highest murder rates. And on Saturday night, there was a terrible shooting in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in which six of my fellow Michiganders were killed and two seriously wounded.  Michigan, and the people leading it, should be humbled by the deaths of so many people. And yet on Tuesday, when members of our legislature return to work in Lansing, many of them will carry guns in the state capitol and, presumably, return to their efforts to loosen our gun laws. Last year, Michigan eliminated its county gun license boards, after pressure from the NRA. The boards had allowed local officials to decline some gun license applications from people they knew were unworthy – like those with a history of misdemeanor domestic violence charges, violent juvenile records or drug or alcohol abuse problems – even if there was no reason under the state law to deny their applications. Now, applicants don’t have to have an in-person interview, and can receive a gun license through a less thoughtful process. There is currently a bill pending in the legislature to simplify the concealed carry gun permit process and not require any license at all – the so-called “constitutional carry” bill. “These bills simply place into law the Second Amendment rights of Michigan residents to bear arms without asking the government’s permission to do so,” one co-sponsor, Representative Tom Barrett, said. Yet the research suggests a strong correlation between weak gun laws and higher rates of gun crimes – a correlation Michigan should be loath to test. Then there is the Senate Bill 442, sponsored by senate leader Michael Green, which would allow people to carry concealed guns into schools, hospitals, bars and several other places that traditionally had been off limits. The bill is opposed by my organization, Physicians for the Prevention of Gun Violence (PPGV), the Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, school administrators, teachers, hospital administrators, Moms Demand Action and Michigan Coalition Against Gun Violence; even the “open carry” gun owners are opposed and even Governor Rick Snyder was unhappy with the bill unless local school boards were allowed to opt out. Last, there is a Preemptive Punishment Bill, HB4795, which would penalize those localities that act to place any limits on gun owners in excess of state law. The bill was seemingly introduced in response to a decision by the Ann Arbor school board to prohibit a gun owner from exercising what he felt was his right to bring a gun to a school function, where state law currently allows him to carry his weapon. If the bill passes, local boards could face civil liability if they persist in restricting people from carrying guns, and gun owners could collect court costs and penalties. With so many NRA members in the state legislature, it’s not surprising that they would seek to liberalize gun laws despite the rash of mass shootings in the US – there have already been 42 in 2016, after 374 in 2015. More children lose their lives to guns than cancer; guns and car accidents kill Americans at an identical rate. We cannot and should not continue to pay this high a cost as a society. Since founding PPGV in 2006 –and especially since Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot as part of a mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011 – my co-founder and I have been working to unite doctors behind the need to address the shootings that have become a public health crisis for the US. We are scientists with a mission, and we are now 370 strong (with a former mayor, professors, deans and over a dozen program directors among us). We know that we must work to counter the actions of those who support the NRA at any cost: we must demand universal background checks, we want technologies to keep children from firing weapons, and we want to make sure that the government does not prohibit doctors from asking their patients about gun safety in the home, as 11 states have already proposed. We want – with our elected officials, who have too often refused to take action – to apologize to the many victims who have waited in vain for the US to catch up with the rest of the civilized world in gun violence prevention. And we can hope that even those who value the Second Amendment begin to value the health and safety of all Americans just as much as what’s written in the US constitution.",2016-02-22 10:44:34,"As Kalamazoo mourns six dead citizens, legislators are making things worse | Jerry S Walden","law and legislation,gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders,violence",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Every Monday The lack of a motive in the Kalamazoo mass shooting is 'baffling,' says local law enforcement. But it's not as uncommon as it might seem. Loading... February 23, 2016 Jason Brian Dalton did not speak at his arraignment Monday on charges of murdering six people in Kalamazoo, Mich., except to ask: “Can I prefer to remain silent?” But it is possible that, even if he did speak, the vexing question of why he allegedly went on a shooting rampage this weekend might not be much clearer. Perhaps it was the bad reviews he got as a driver for Uber. Perhaps it was the stress trying to make ends meet. Perhaps it was none of these things. Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley called the lack of a motive “baffling” Monday. But it’s not unusual. “What we’re always looking for in these cases is motive, and the truth is motive is elusive,” says Eugene O’Donnell, a lecturer at the City University of New York’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “When all is said and done, it’s pretty common to not have any clarity about why people are acting” like that. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation definition of a mass shooting – an incident in which four or more people are killed – this is the second of 2016. The first involved a domestic murder-suicide in Chesapeake, Va., on Jan. 27 that left six dead. There were 22 such shootings last year. “It falls within what I would argue are the crucial characteristics of a public mass shooting,” says Deborah Azrael, director of research for the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. There are few details on Dalton, but experts point to some elements of his backstory. One of Mr. Dalton’s Uber customers told The New York Times that during a Feb. 14 ride, he told her, unsolicited, that he had only been working as an Uber driver “a day or two” and that “he had already gotten some bad reviews.” “He said it was just drunk kids and his car messing up a little bit,” added the customer, Sara Reynolds, describing Dalton as “a little shy and awkward, but … pretty normal for the most part.” He has no criminal record and passed an Uber background check prior to becoming a driver. He had worked for Progressive Insurance until mid-2011 as an insurance adjuster, according to news reports. He also taught an auto-repair class at an area community college, according to the Associated Press. Married and a father of two, neighbors described him as quiet and polite in news reports, highlighting that he enjoyed playing with his kids and maintaining his cars and occasionally shot a gun out the back door of his house. How these scraps of information relate, if at all, to the six murders is unclear, but experts say the shootings fit a larger pattern of men carrying out mass shootings. “Most men are not violent, [but] most acts of violence are committed by men,” says Jon Davies, director of the McKenzie River Men’s Center in Eugene, Ore. “There are different pressures on middle-aged men,” says Dr. Davies. “They expect more of themselves. He may have a job, but he might be struggling economically, so while he is supporting his basic needs, he feels like he may not be as far along as he wants to be.” Economic uncertainty can fuel some of this anxiety, says Christopher Kilmartin, a professor of psychological science at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Va. “If you’re poor, and you don’t think you’re supposed to be poor because you’re a white man,” he adds, “you think it’s somebody else’s fault, then you go and act out aggressively.” Kalamazoo’s economic picture is mixed. Its unemployment rate falls below the national average, but its poverty level falls above. In Kalamazoo County in 2014, 24 percent of all households were what used to be referred to as the working poor – above the poverty level, but below cost-of-living standards, according a study by Rutgers University in New Jersey. Another 17 percent fell below the poverty level, according to a story by the Kalamazoo Gazette. (The city has a large number of college students, which can cause those results to spike higher.) Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. On the plus side, unemployment in the area is at 3.5 percent, according to Charles Ballard, a professor of economics at Michigan State University, and Kalamazoo County had the 12th-highest per-capita income in the state in 2014. “The Kalamazoo area is doing better than many areas in Michigan,” he adds. “If we’re searching for an explanation for the shooting over the weekend, I think we’d probably have to do more to look at the particulars of that particular individual rather than general economic malaise.” Already a subscriber?

Every Monday Members of the Virginia Tech community are finding themselves in a too-familiar limelight as they cope with two fellow students facing charges in the slaying of a 13-year-old girl. Loading... February 20, 2016 As two Virginia Tech students face charges in the slaying of a 13-year-old girl, their classmates are repeating what they have said following other violent debacles in the last decade: The community is defined not by the horrific crimes themselves, but by the way its people pull together afterward. Seventh-grader Nicole Madison Lovell's stabbing death last month marks the latest in what seems a disproportionate number of high-profile slayings in a bucolic region anchored by a university known for its engineering and veterinary programs and its Hokies football team. Tech freshman David Eisenhauer is charged with abducting and killing Nicole, and classmate Natalie Keepers is charged with helping plan the crime and illegally disposing of the victim's body. ""A lot of people are saying these students weren't real Hokies,"" said Arlena Nickle, a freshman marketing and hospitality major from Blacksburg. ""This is not how we want Virginia Tech portrayed."" Malik Harmon, a materials science and engineering major from Roanoke who works with Nickle at a small convenience store in the Tech student center, said the incident ""doesn't define our community at all."" Violent crime happens everywhere, he said, but it just seems to get more attention when it happens on campus or involves college students. The spotlight on Virginia Tech was brightest in 2007 when a mentally disturbed student shot and killed 32 people on campus before killing himself — the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. But there have been other tragedies. The year before the mass shooting, an armed robbery suspect shot and killed a hospital security guard and a Montgomery County deputy sheriff near the campus, which was locked down during a manhunt. The gunman, William Morva, is now on Virginia's death row. Two years after the massacre, a 22-year-old student was decapitated by a classmate who was carrying the woman's head when confronted by police in a campus cafe. That was followed by the 2011 shooting death of a Virginia Tech police officer who was ambushed during a traffic stop by a Radford University student, who then took his own life, and the 2014 strangulation of one Virginia Tech student by another during a date. ""I don't think it has anything to do with Virginia Tech or Blacksburg,"" sophomore human development major Emily Kilpatrick of Fredericksburg said of the string of violent incidents. ""Some people will look at Virginia Tech in a bad way, but it's not like Virginia Tech taught them to do these things."" Students organized a vigil in Nicole's memory — the latest example of how they respond in times of trouble, Harmon said. ""The community kind of came together a bit,"" he said. ""I have a friend who sang at the vigil. I think everybody had some sort of role in trying to make things better."" Danny Purcell, a freshman biology major from Fredericksburg, said students have drawn closer in less public ways as well. ""It's human nature,"" he said. ""We seek the comfort of another person."" Montgomery County chief prosecutor Mary Pettitt said most students fall in the age range for people most likely to commit murder and to be first diagnosed with mental health issues. Many also are away from family support systems for the first time. ""However, the fact that this community is shocked by each of these murders tells you more about the community than the murders do,"" she said in an email. She said the region is ""a place where people not only know their neighbors but they look out for them."" Tech spokeswoman Tracy Vosburgh acknowledged in an email that the community has had ""more than its share of tragic events."" But she also noted that with 40,000 students, faculty and staff, Virginia Tech is essentially a small city and ""must face all the issues, both good and bad, every community must face."" ""We are fortunate because our community and our university have a special bond — an enduring relationship that has provided essential support to both,"" she said. Alison Kiss, executive director of the Clery Center for Security on Campus, said Virginia Tech ""has been one of the leaders in campus threat assessment since the shootings in 2007."" She said the Lovell case illustrates the need for students to speak up if they become concerned about a classmate's behavior, although people who knew Eisenhauer and Keepers have said they noticed nothing unusual. Students said the latest tragedy has been a major topic of conversation on campus. The same is true in the community, said 68-year-old Becky Cox of Christiansburg, the county seat just seven miles south of campus. Cox had no thoughts on why Tech has suffered so many heartbreaks in recent years, but she alluded to the role that social media might have played in Nicole's case. Authorities have said Nicole might have met Eisenhauer on a popular messaging app, and the girl's father said on a recent episode of ""Dr. Phil"" that she had been communicating online with older men. David Lovell said his daughter lost her cellphone privileges shortly before Christmas but got them back. ""I think parents are falling short of their job as parents,"" Cox said. ""As long as the child's happy, the parent's happy. That's not how it should be."" Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Nicole's mother, Tammy Weeks, said the teenager had endured bullying online and at school — a factor that experts said made her particularly vulnerable as she sought affection and acceptance on social media. Weeks said at the vigil that she harbored no ill will toward Virginia Tech, only for the person or persons responsible for Nicole's death. Eisenhauer and Keepers are being held without bond.

88,http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/apples-privacy-battle-foresees-global-effects/2266192,"SAN FRANCISCO — It took six years for Apple to persuade China's largest wireless carrier, China Mobile, to sell the iPhone. Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, made repeated trips to China to meet with top government officials and executives to woo them personally. The persistence paid off. In 2013, China Mobile relented, a moment Cook later described as ""a watershed day"" for Apple. Today, China is Apple's second-largest market after the United States — Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products in the last fiscal year — and the iPhone, the company's top seller, has become both a status symbol and a form of personal security, given how difficult the device is to break into in a country where people increasingly worry about hacking and cybercrime. Apple's success in China helps explain why it is now in a standoff with the U.S. government over whether to help officials gain access to the encrypted iPhone of one of the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting last December. The company is playing the long game with its business. Privacy and security have become part of its brand, especially internationally, where it reaps nearly two-thirds of its almost $234 billion a year in sales. And if it cooperates with one government, the thinking goes, it will have to cooperate with all of them. ""Tim Cook is leveraging his personal brand and Apple's to stand on the side of consumer privacy in this environment,"" said Mark Bartholomew, a law professor at the University at Buffalo who studies encryption and cyberlaw. ""He is taking the long view."" Cook, who has called privacy a civic duty, said as much in a letter to Apple customers Tuesday. He described how the U.S. government was asking for a special tool to break into the San Bernardino attacker's iPhone and said, ""The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices."" An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the remarks in Cook's letter. The business advantage Apple may get from privacy has given critics an opening to attack the company. In a court filing Friday, the Justice Department said Apple's opposition to helping law enforcement appeared ""to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy."" Apple senior executives responded that their defiance was not a business choice. They added that there had not been any business fallout and that Cook had received supportive emails from customers across the country. In fact, Apple has not made a point of advertising data security and privacy. The company has quietly built privacy features into its mobile operating system, known as iOS, over time. By late 2013, when Apple released its iOS 7 system, the company was encrypting by default all third-party data stored on customers' phones. And iOS 8, which became available in 2014, made it basically impossible for the company's engineers to extract any data from mobile phones and tablets. Cook also has been vocal about how Apple is pro-privacy, a message that he discussed more widely after revelations from the former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden about government surveillance. Cook argued that the company sold hardware — phones, tablets and laptops — and did not depend on the mass collection of consumer data as some Silicon Valley behemoths, such as Google and Facebook, do for their advertising-oriented businesses. At a conference in October, Cook called privacy a ""key value"" at Apple and said, ""We think that it will become increasingly important to more and more people over time as they realize that intimate parts of their lives are sort of in the open and being used for all sorts of things."" For Apple, cooperating with the U.S. government now could quickly lead to murkier situations internationally. In China, for example, Apple — like any other foreign company selling smartphones — hands over devices for import checks by Chinese regulators. Apple also maintains server computers in China, but Apple has previously said that Beijing cannot view the data and that the keys to the servers are not stored in China. In practice and according to Chinese law, Beijing typically has access to any data stored in China. If Apple accedes to U.S. law enforcement demands for opening the iPhone in the San Bernardino case and Beijing asks for a similar tool, it is unlikely Apple would be able to control China's use of it. Yet if Apple were to refuse Beijing, it would potentially face a battery of penalties. Analysts said Chinese officials were pushing for greater control over the encryption and security of computers and phones sold in the country, though Beijing last year backed off on some proposals that would have required foreign companies to provide encryption keys for devices sold in the country after facing pressure from foreign trade groups. ""People tend to forget the global impact of this,"" said Raman Jit Singh Chima, policy director at Access Now, a nonprofit that works for Internet freedoms. ""The reality is the damage done when a democratic government does something like this is massive. It's even more negative in places where there are fewer freedoms."" Governments in Russia, Britain and Israel also have robust surveillance operations. Some governments have tried to use technology to gather intelligence on citizens at home and abroad. Apple's resistance to the U.S. government's demand has been polarizing. Apple supporters have held protests in cities like San Francisco in recent days to show their support of the company and have used hashtags on social media like #freeapple and #beatthecase. ""We're fighting to maintain even the assumption that companies should protect us,"" said Evan Greer, the campaign director at Fight for the Future, a civil liberties group that is organizing protests nationwide Tuesday to support Apple. ""Apple is doing what every company should be doing."" Others, including the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, have criticized Apple, and Trump has suggested boycotting its products. Around the world, people are aware of the impasse, but many say it does not affect their decision to buy iPhones and the company's other products. In Rome on Friday, Simone Farelli, a 34-year-old history teacher who was browsing for a new iPhone at an Apple Store, said she ""didn't see why"" the company's standoff with the FBI ""would change my mind about buying a new phone."" In China, the iPhone continues to hold a special place as a symbol of middle-class status. Wen Shuyue, a 35-year-old consultant, who was waiting outside the Apple Store in Beijing's upscale Sanlitun district Friday, is one of Apple's millions of Chinese users. He said he liked the iPhone because it was simply better than models made by Chinese companies, such as Xiaomi and Huawei. ""I've never used Xiaomi or Huawei, because I think their designs are rough and not all that personal,"" he said. Apple's shareholders have so far been quiet. In the past, investors who complained that some of Apple's socially driven initiatives were superfluous to the company's core business were quickly subdued. At a 2014 shareholders' meeting, Cook told investors that if they wanted him to make decisions based only on the bottom line, ""then you should get out of the stock."" But data privacy may eventually motivate investors — and ultimately more customers — to vote with their wallets because ""it's an issue that speaks directly to the business,"" said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. ""Right now, people buy phones regardless of encryption issues, but we have to wait and see how bloody this fight gets.""",2016-02-20 20:10:36,Apple's privacy battle foresees global effects,,22,http://www.tampabay.com/
89,http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2016/02/6_dead_in_michigan_as_teen_cli.html," Gallery: Several people dead in multiple Kalamazoo County shootings KALAMAZOO, Michigan -- The suspect arrested in a mass shooting spree here that killed six and injured two acted alone, authorities said. Jason B. Dalton, 45, was taken into custody in the parking lot of a downtown Kalamazoo bar sat around 12:40 a.m. Sunday when a Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety Officer spotted the vehicle that had been identified in the shootings. Dalton was arrested without incident, authorities said in a press conference Sunday morning at Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety headquarters. ""We are very confident that we have the right person in custody. We have significant evidence to tie him to these incidents,"" said Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting. He declined to discuss specific evidence, but said a semi-automatic handgun was seized from the Chevrolet HHR that Dalton was driving. A 14-year-old girl, whom police originally believed had died, is clinging to life Sunday morning. ""She is seriously, gravely injured but she is still alive at this point,"" Getting said.

90,http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/02/kalamazoo_mass_shootings_how_h.html," Gallery: Several people dead in multiple Kalamazoo County shootings KALAMAZOO, MI - As a gunman randomly stalked victims in a shooting rampage that left six dead, others critically injured and the Kalamazoo community on edge, Mayor Bobby Hopewell said it was hard to imagine a darker day in the city's history. ""This act was such a heinous act - and it created a lot of pain for a whole bunch of folks in a city that certainly never thought this was going to happen,"" Hopewell said Sunday, Feb. 21. He said police kept the death toll from rising by catching the suspect, Jason Brian Dalton, 45, early Sunday before he could kill again. He likened Saturday's killings to the 1980 tornado that killed five people, but said these deaths came at the hands of a ""sad, sad man,"" and brought a ""visceral feeling, you get a feeling of sickness."" The victims included a senior at Mattawan High School and a retired Battle Creek teacher. Tyler Smith, 17, and his father, Rich Smith, of Mattawan, were killed at the Seelye Automotive car lot on Stadium Drive. Mary Jo Nye, 60, Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, Barbara Hawthorne, 68, all of Battle Creek, and Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, were in the Cracker Barrel parking lot on 9th Street near I-94. A 14-year-old girl who was also shot there is clinging to life, police said. The girl had been pronounced dead, and kept on life support for organ donation, before she squeezed her mother's hands, state police Lt. Dale Hinz said. The girl was with family at the restaurant but her mother was not there. ""It's absolutely a miracle that she's alive and we're definitely hopeful for her continued improvement,"" Hinz said. Mary Jo Nye taught English at Calhoun Community High School. Police said the Battle Creek women and teen were shot while in a Chevrolet Cruze while the other woman was shot while in an Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan. The Nyes were sisters-in-law who met monthly for shows at Miller Auditorium and dinner at Cracker Barrel. It was the 42nd mass shooting (four or more victims, including shooter) this year, according to the Washington Post. It was the worst mass shooting in Michigan since July 7, 2011, when Rodrick Dantzler killed seven in Grand Rapids before taking hostages and turning the gun on himself. ""The shootings are a senseless act of violence that claimed the lives of innocent citizens and injured two others,"" Gov. Rick Snyder said. ""Our hearts are broken for the victims' families and friends, and I join in mourning their loss."" He said flags will be flown at half-staff for six days, for each of victims who died. Police said Dalton was believed to have acted alone and, once he was in custody, announced there was no longer a threat to public safety. He was in contact with others throughout the night but investigators would not disclose who or the content of those conversations. Police recovered a semiautomatic gun and a cell phone in Dalton's car. Police said he fired at least 30 rounds during the rampage. Authorities have not released the caliber of handgun Dalton allegedly used. ""The evidence at each of the scenes is consistent with each other and it's consistent with the evidence recovered but that doesn't necessarily mean it's all the same gun,"" Getting said. State police will conduct ballistics tests, he said. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was tracing the gun's history. Police also searched his home in the 7000-block of Douglas Avenue. Dalton, an insurance adjustor known as a decent neighbor who liked to tinker with cars, is expected to face six murder charges. The allegations stunned neighbors in the rural area on the northwest corner of Douglas and E avenues. ""He just didn't seem like that kind of guy,"" said Gary Pardo, who lives across the street.
Another neighbor, Katie Beal, 24, said Dalton kept to himself. He was married with two children. ""I think something happened where he just snapped,"" she said. She and her boyfriend, Chad Landon, have never talked to Dalton, who had lived there for a decade. Neighbors were concerned about his family, though. Neighbors heard gunshots at the house late Saturday and didn't see them on Sunday. But police said the family was safe. The horror of the killings will not immediately fade, but Kalamazoo is a ""resilient community,"" the mayor said. ""It's going to be tough for everyone,"" Hopewell said. ""Certainly, this is a sad day and emotional day for everyone. We'll come together around the victims, lend them support, as we would for any victim of violence. ... Nothing prepares you for this. I'm trying to find words. There's just no playbook for that.""

KALAMAZOO, MI -- A 14-year-old girl who was among several people shot in a rampage in Kalamazoo was feared to be dead -- until she squeezed her mother's hand. The girl was critically injured in a shooting that killed four others in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Texas Township, one of three shooting scenes where six people died Saturday night, Feb. 20, Authorities early Sunday morning told the media she had died. At Bronson Methodist Hospital, her heart had stopped beating, and doctors had restored her heart beat. Then she squeezed her mother's hand. Doctors, however, feared she could become brain dead. At her parents' request, they contacted Gift of Life in the event of organ donation, but had yet to perform tests to see if she had become brain dead, Bronson officials said Wednesday. ""She's in extremely critical condition but she's still clinging to life,"" Michigan State Police First Lt. Dale Hinz said Sunday morning. Authorities at a press conference Sunday clarified that the girl, later identified as Abigail Kopf, was still alive. RELATED: Abigail Kopf not brain dead but 'alive and fighting for her life' Hinz said the girl's mother was not at the restaurant with her, but the teen was with other family friends at the time of the shooting. ""The only word to describe it is wow,"" Hinz said of the girl being alive. ""It's absolutely a miracle that she's alive and we're definitely hopeful for her continued improvement."" The shooting scenes threw Kalamazoo County into chaos late Saturday and early Sunday as police tried to make sense of the seemingly random murder spree. Police arrested the suspect, Jason B. Dalton, 45, on Ransom Street near Porter Street on the downtown Kalamazoo's near north side at about 12:40 a.m. Police in a press conference said Dalton did not resist police, and no officers were injured. A sheriff's deputy spotted the vehicle and Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety officers joined in, pulling Dalton over in a traffic stop. KDPS Chief Jeff Hadley said after the arrest police wondered if there were perhaps other victims since the acts were so random, but at this point they are unaware of any other people who were shot during the murder spree. ""It's totally unprovoked, random acts of violence,"" he said. ""We're still trying to figure out the motives."" Authorities for several hours Saturday worked the multiple shooting scenes. Michigan State Police, Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department and the Kalamazoo Public Safety Department worked the multiple shooting scenes. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting during a news conference Sunday morning praised cooperation among police agencies. ""There is no question in my mind that the police work that was done in this incident saved lives,"" he said. Emily Monacelli is a reporter for MLive.com.

Jason B. Dalton, 45, was taken into custody shortly after he pulled out of a parking lot of a downtown Kalamazoo bar at around 12:40 a.m. Sunday. As he pulled out, a sheriff's deputy spotted the vehicle as the one identified in the shootings. Dalton was arrested without incident a few blocks away, authorities said in a press conference Sunday morning at Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety headquarters. ""We are very confident that we have the right person in custody. We have significant evidence to tie him to these incidents,"" said Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting. He declined to discuss specific evidence, but said a semi-automatic handgun was seized from the Chevrolet HHR that Dalton was driving. A 14-year-old girl, whom police originally believed had died, is clinging to life Sunday morning. ""She is seriously, gravely injured but she is still alive at this point,"" Getting said.

Most were hitchhikers whom Bonin lured into his green van and strangled. Bonin was executed in 1996.  Married couple Cynthia Coffman and James Marlow, an ex-convict from Kentucky known as “The Folsom Wolf,” after serving time at Folsom Prison, they beat, raped and strangled college student Lynell Murray, 19, who worked in Huntington Beach, and left her body in a bathtub in November 1986. Marlow was sentenced to death and Coffman sentenced to life in prison without parole for Murray's murder. Both remain in prison.  Dixie Dyson plotted with her lover and another man to kill her husband in his sleep -- and collect $135,000 in life insurance in their Huntington Harbour condo. An Orange County jury agreed, convicting her of first-degree murder in 1988. After her trial, Dyson cooperated in the prosecution of her lover, Enrico Vasquez, and his pal, Ira Lamb, and her conviction was reduced to second-degree murder. She was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison.  David Arnold Brown was out buying comic books – he made sure of that – when his 14-year-old daughter, Cinnamon Brown, climbed on his bed and shot his wife, Linda, twice in the chest at their Garden Grove home. In 1988, the teenager told detectives that her father and Patti Bailey had plotted the murder. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. He died in March, 2014. Cinnamon Brown served eight years before she was released.  Serial killer Gerald Parker was stationed at the El Toro, California, Marine Air Station at the time he raped and murdered five Orange County women in Costa Mesa, Tustin and Anaheim in the 1970s, earning the nickname “the Bedroom Basher,” because he bludgeoned his victims with a hammer, a mallet or a two-by-four. In 1998, he was convicted of six counts or rape, six counts of first-degree murder and one count first-degree attempted murder. He was sentenced to death, and remains on Death Row.  In July 2002 Alejandro Avila, of Lake Elsinore kidnapped five-year-old Samantha Runnion from her apartment complex in Stanton. Hikers found her body off the Ortega Highway in the hills overlooking Lake Elsinore. President George W. Bush ordered federal resources available and more than 100 FBI agents joined 300 Orange County sheriff's deputies in tracking the killer of “America's Little Girl.” In 2005, Avila was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.  Randy Kraft, Orange County's most prolific serial killer, raped, tortured and killed as many as 65 young men. He was caught when he was pulled over and an officer found a dead Marine in the passenger seat.  Rodney James Alcala, a photographer, was a convicted child rapist when he appeared on TV's “The Dating Game” in 1978 – and won. A year after the TV show, Alcala murdered a fourth woman, in Burbank, then cruised Huntington Beach, looking for a younger victim. He found her in a 12-year-old blond dancer, pedaling her bicycle to ballet class. Alcala pulled out his camera and went to work.  As part of a double-murder plot Daniel Wozniak in May 2010, beheaded a man and tossed the severed head in a public park. It was all part of an elaborate murder plot that the leading man scripted for himself – to pay for his upcoming wedding. In December, a jury convicted Wozniak of two murders and recommended the death penalty. He awaits sentencing in March. His former fiancé Rachel Buffett awaits trial on charges of accessory to crimes after the fact.  Denise Huber disappeared in 1991 after her car was disabled on the 73. Arizona sheriff's deputies found her  body in a freezer belonging to former Lake Forest house painter John Famalaro in 1994.  After departing Newport Harbor n November 2004, according to testimony at trial, Skylar Deleon tied Tom and Jackie Hawkes to the 66-pound anchor of “Well Deserved,” and plunged it into the Pacific Ocean. Deleon had inquired about purchasing the yacht for $460,000 a few weeks earlier. He'd taken a few rides, and was back for one last sea trial to Catalina. In 2009, Skylar Deleon and helper John F. Kennedy were sentenced to death.  Cal State Fullerton janitor Edward Charles Allaway carried a 22-caliber semiautomatic rifle into the campus library basement and methodically walked room to room, firing indiscriminately at colleagues starting their work day. At the time, it was the bloodiest rampage in Orange County history.  A Mission Viejo woman awoke to the sound of gun shots in her bedroom on the night of Aug. 25, 1985. An intruder shot her fiancé three times in the head, then raped her in the bed beside him. Richard Ramirez, nicknamed the “Night Stalker” because he snuck into homes at night, through unlocked doors and windows. In 1989, Ramirez was sentenced to death for killing 13 people.  In October 2011, Scott Dekraai, embittered from a custody battle, decided to kill his ex-wife. He entered Salon Meritage, in Seal Beach and committed the deadliest mass shooting in Orange County history which killed eight people. Dekraai pleaded guilty to the murders. He remains in jail awaiting the penalty phase of his trial.  Omaima Nelson, 24, thought she'd found the man of her dreams in William Nelson, 56, a former Marine pilot. But four weeks after their union, Omaima bludgeoned her new husband to death with a clothes iron and boiled his head at their Costa Mesa apartment. In 1993, she was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 28 years to life in prison.  We live in the land of sunshine, sandy beaches and opportunity. And, sometimes, bizarre murders. “Dateline NBC” recently aired a two-hour segment exploring the crimes of Costa Mesa community theater actor Daniel Wozniak, convicted of beheading a neighbor to pay for his upcoming wedding and facing a possible death sentence in March. Wozniak staged the double murder to make it appear one victim sexually molested the other; he cut off one victim’s head and tossed it in a park, then he calmly walked onto a Fullerton stage and performed in the starring role in a musical. “There’s nothing wrong with his head,” prosecutor Matt Murphy told jurors during the December trial. “It’s what’s wrong with Daniel Wozniak’s heart.” Some of America’s most heartless killers have prowled our streets. We’ve fallen prey to the Night Stalker, the Freeway Killer and the Folsom Wolf. We’ve had murderers who licked their victim’s blood; who boiled their victim’s head; and who saved a victim’s body as a trophy. Then there’s Randy Kraft, Orange County’s most prolific serial killer. He raped, tortured and killed as many as 65 young men and only was caught when a patrolman pulled him over on I-5 – and found a dead Marine in the passenger seat. Here are 15 of Orange County’s most notorious cases. Campus gunman  Who: Edward Charles Allaway When: July 12, 1976 Where: Cal State Fullerton What: Shortly before 7 a.m., Allaway, a Cal State Fullerton janitor who had served in the Marines, carried a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle into the campus library basement. The 37-year-old with a history of mental illness methodically walked room to room, firing indiscriminately at colleagues starting their workday. At the time, it was the bloodiest rampage in Orange County history. It was over in five minutes. He shot nine people, reloading as he went, and killed seven. Two victims staggered outside before they fell dead. The rest lay scattered on the basement floor. Allaway then drove to a nearby Hilton Inn Hotel where his estranged wife worked. He called police and surrendered. The former Sunday school teacher claimed that delusions sparked the attack. A judge later found Allaway not guilty by reason of insanity and he remains in a state mental hospital. Through the years, he has petitioned to go free, claiming he is cured and no longer dangerous. Each time, prosecutors successfully argued to keep Allaway locked up. Freeway Killer  Who: William Bonin When: 1979-80 Where: Los Angeles and Orange counties What: Bonin raped, tortured and murdered 21 boys along Southern California freeways over a 10-month period. Most were hitchhikers whom he lured into his green van and strangled. His youngest victim was Jimmy Macabe, 12, of Garden Grove, who was abducted while waiting for a bus to Disneyland. One of the oldest victims was grocery clerk Darin Lee Kendrick, 19, of Stanton, who was abducted while gathering shopping carts in the supermarket parking lot. Bonin, a truck driver from Downey, raped his victims, then dumped their bodies along the road. For this, he was nicknamed the Freeway Killer. After his arrest, Bonin confessed, telling one TV reporter: “I couldn’t stop killing. It got easier with each one we did.” Bonin, a Vietnam veteran, was convicted of four murders in Orange County and 10 in Los Angeles County. On Feb. 23, 1996, he was executed by lethal injection at San Quentin State Prison. ‘Dating Game’ contestant  Who: Rodney James Alcala When: June 20, 1979 Where: Huntington Beach What: Alcala already was a convicted child rapist when he appeared on TV’s “The Dating Game” in 1978 – and won. No one knew or even suspected that in the previous year, he had murdered three women. The long-haired former photographer used his camera to approach women, witnesses later would testify, and once he gained their trust, he raped, beat and strangled them. A year after the TV show, Alcala murdered a fourth woman, in Burbank, then cruised Huntington Beach, looking for a younger victim. He found her in a 12-year-old blond dancer pedaling her bicycle to ballet class. Alcala pulled out his camera and went to work. That day, June 20, 1979, he abducted young Robin Samsoe near her Huntington Beach home. Twelve days later, her skeletal remains turned up in a ravine in the Angeles National Forest. When investigators learned that Alcala had photographed the girl just hours before she disappeared, they arrested him. Twice Alcala was sentenced to death and twice his convictions were overturned on appeal. In 2009, Alcala returned to court a third time, facing five murder counts. Alcala represented himself. He conceded the murders of four women but steadfastly denied killing Robin Samsoe. During closing arguments, however, he played the song, “Alice’s Restaurant,” in which singer Arlo Guthrie sings the line: “I want to kill.” Alcala was convicted of all five killings and sentenced to death. He awaits execution. Computer consultant-turned- serial killer  Who: Randy Kraft When: 1983 Where: Mission Viejo What: In the early hours of May 13, 1983, California Highway Patrol officers pulled over a brown Toyota Celica slowly weaving along the freeway in Mission Viejo. A driver emerged and approached officers. They escorted him back to his car where they found a strangled Marine in the passenger seat, and a coded “death list” in the trunk, said to be the names of all his victims. Kraft’s arrest ended an 11-year stretch in which he drugged, sexually tortured and strangled up to 65 young men, many with their own belts. Kraft, a 38-year-old Long Beach computer consultant, targeted young drifters and Marines he found hitchhiking. He plied them with alcohol and sedatives, usually Valium, until they couldn’t fight back. In 1989, Kraft was convicted of 16 murders after an 11-month trial, at the time the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in Orange County history. His family and colleagues described him as a hardworking computer expert who organized his father’s 83rd birthday party and served as an usher at his niece’s wedding – a man who liked playing bridge and pinochle with buddies. In 1989, as he was led from court after being sentenced to death, the father of one victim yelled out to him: “Burn in hell, Kraft.” He remains on death row at San Quentin Prison. ‘Something in the water’  Who: Dixie Dyson When: Nov. 18, 1984 Where: Huntington Beach What: Dyson insisted that her sleeping husband was stabbed to death by a masked intruder who then raped her and forced her to drive him away. Huntington Beach detectives were unconvinced. Why had Dyson conveniently slept in another room that night? Why was there no blood on her or her car? Why did she wait several hours to call police to their Huntington Harbour condo? Prosecutors alleged that the 44-year-old Dyson plotted with her lover and another man to kill her husband in his sleep – and collect $135,000 in life insurance. An Orange County jury convicted her of first-degree murder in 1988. Strangely enough, Dyson was not the only wife who hired a hit man to kill her husband in Huntington Beach in 1984. Two others did the same thing: Jeanette Hughes was convicted of having husband Jim Hughes shot to death as he slept in their bed. And Anita Ford was convicted of arranging the killing of husband Barry Ford, who was found shot to death in an industrial park. Local police were flabbergasted; premeditated spousal murders are rare. Statewide, 57 women killed their husbands in 1984, and many of those killings occurred during a fight or argument. In all three Huntington Beach cases, detectives alleged, the women conspired with male friends to kill their husbands for insurance money. “We hadn’t seen anything like that before,” Detective Richard Hooper said in 1988. “And then all of a sudden, we’ve got three of them in a row.” Dyson’s defense attorney, Andrew Stein, said at the time: “It’s just weird. There must be something in the water.” After her trial, Dyson cooperated in the prosecution of her lover, Enrico Vasquez, and his pal, Ira Lamb, and her conviction was reduced to second-degree murder. Dyson was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. She has been denied parole several times, and is eligible again this year. Night Stalker  Who: Richard Ramirez When: 1984-85 Where: Southern California What: A Mission Viejo woman awoke to the sound of gunshots in her bedroom on the night of Aug. 25, 1985. An intruder shot her fiancé three times in the head, then raped her in the bed beside him. “You know who I am, don’t you?” he said, making her swear to Satan. “I am the Night Stalker.” For more than a year, Ramirez, a 25-year-old drifter from Texas, terrorized Southern California in a rampage of murder, rape, mutilation and sodomy. The press nicknamed him the Night Stalker because he sneaked into homes at night through unlocked doors and windows. He killed his victims with handguns, knives, a machete, a tire iron and a hammer. Mission Viejo gunshot victim William Carns miraculously survived, as did his fiancée, whom Ramirez left tied up on the floor of their Mediterranean Village apartment. As Ramirez drove away, she struggled to a window and got a description of his orange Toyota station wagon that led to his arrest. In 1989, Ramirez was sentenced to death for killing 13 people. While on death row at San Quentin, he got married – something Carns and his fiancée never did after the trauma they endured. In 2013, Ramirez died of complications from B-cell lymphoma while awaiting execution. Folsom Wolf and the cocktail waitress  Who: James Marlow and Cynthia Coffman When: 1986 Where: Huntington Beach What: On Nov. 12, 1986, college student Lynell Murray missed a dinner date with her boyfriend. He drove to her workplace, a Huntington Beach dry cleaner, found it ransacked and called police to report her disappearance. About the same time, James Marlow and Cynthia Coffman used Murray’s credit card to check into Room 307 of the Huntington Beach Inn. That night, they raped and strangled Murray, 19, and left her body in the bathtub. About midnight, the couple dined on shrimp and steak at a Denny’s restaurant in Ontario. Marlow was an ex-convict from Kentucky known as the Folsom Wolf after serving time at Folsom Prison. Coffman was a former cocktail waitress who’d tattooed the words “Property of the Folsom Wolf” on her buttocks. Five days earlier, the couple had abducted and killed Redlands insurance clerk Corrina Novis, 20, and buried her in a vineyard. Two days after Murray’s death, police traced Marlow and Coffman to a Big Bear lodge and arrested them on a hiking trail – both in clothes stolen from the dry cleaner where they had abducted Murray at gunpoint. Both were sentenced to death for Novis’ murder. Marlow was sentenced to death and Coffman was sentenced to life in prison without parole for Murray’s murder. Both remain in prison. Daughter took the rap  Who: David Arnold Brown When: March 19, 1985 Where: Garden Grove What: David Brown was out buying comic books – he made sure of that – when his 14-year-old daughter climbed on his bed and shot his wife, Linda, twice in the chest. When police arrived at the family’s Garden Grove home, officers found Cinnamon Brown, 14, lying in her own vomit in the doghouse, clutching a note that read: “Dear God, please forgive me. I didn’t mean to hurt her.” A visibly shaken David Brown, 36, said he went out that night to get away from the bickering between his wife and daughter. Cinnamon confessed, and was sent to the California Youth Authority in Camarillo. Case closed. Or was it? While she languished in prison, her computer-whiz father collected $850,000 in life insurance. He secretly married his dead wife’s 17-year-old sister, Patti Bailey. He drove new cars and bought new homes. And he stopped visiting the daughter he once implored: “If you loved me, you would do this for me.” In 1988, the teenager told detectives that her father and Bailey had plotted the murder, assuring her that she was too young to go to prison. They gave her a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson and prescription medicines to take that night. Both Cinnamon Brown and Bailey testified against David Brown in his 1990 trial, which spawned a made-for-TV movie and two true-crime books. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. He died in 2014. Cinnamon Brown served eight years before she was released. Trophy murder  Who: John Famalaro When: June 3, 1991 Where: Costa Mesa What: She just vanished one night. Newport Beach waitress Denise Huber was returning home from a Morrissey concert when her Honda had a blowout about 2 a.m. on the 73. Friends found her car just south of Bear Street in Costa Mesa. But there was no sign of Huber for more than three years – until Arizona authorities found her decomposed body in a freezer belonging to Famalaro, a former Lake Forest house painter. As a child, Famalaro was spanked at home and bullied at school. As an adult, he stalked one girlfriend and handcuffed another. Then in the early morning hours of June 3, 1991, he saw Huber, 23, stranded along the freeway. Famalaro took her to a Laguna Hills warehouse he rented and shattered her skull. He then devised a way to preserve the body as a “trophy” – to remind him of his conquest, prosecutor Christopher Evans said at trial. Famalaro ordered a new Montgomery Ward freezer and had it delivered to the Laguna Hills warehouse where he lived at the time. Over the next three years, Famalaro moved the 23-cubic-foot, chest-style freezer to other storage sheds, always insisting the power be kept on. In 1994, he took the freezer with him to Arizona, where investigators found Huber’s frozen body. Inside the house, they found her clothes and purse inside a box marked “Christmas decorations.” In 1997, a jury took less than six hours to convict Famalaro of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to death and remains on death row. House of horrors  Who: Omaima Nelson When: 1991 Where: Costa Mesa What: When she married on Nov. 1, 1991, Egyptian model Nelson thought she’d found the man of her dreams in William Nelson, 56, who had been a Marine pilot. “He was a gentleman who would open the door for me and take me out to dinner,” she’d later say. But four weeks after their union, Omaima, 24, bludgeoned her new husband to death with a clothes iron and boiled his head. When police entered their Elden Avenue apartment on Dec. 2, 1991, they walked into a macabre house of horrors that included bloody sheets, a butcher knife and four trash bags stuffed with William Nelson’s body parts. A fifth trash bag, holding his vital organs, was stashed in his red Corvette parked outside the Sus Casitas Apartments. In court, Omaima claimed that William sexually abused her and that she killed him to stop a string of rapes and beatings. She admitted to chopping him into pieces and hiding some parts with leftover Thanksgiving turkey. She boiled her husband’s head and hands in water and told a psychologist that she added spices and tasted it. In 1993, she was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 28 years to life in prison. “I’m sorry I dismembered his body,” she said at her 2011 parole hearing. “I freaked out. I was temporarily insane.” She is eligible for parole in 2026. Bedroom Basher  Who: Gerald Parker When: 1970s Where: Costa Mesa, Tustin and Anaheim What: He almost got away with six murders – while an innocent man languished in prison 16 years for the crime. Parker raped and murdered five Orange County women in the 1970s, earning the nickname the Bedroom Basher because he bludgeoned his victims with a hammer, a mallet or a two-by-four. On Sept. 30, 1979, he left his sixth victim, a pregnant Tustin woman, Dianna Green, in a monthlong coma. When she awoke, she accused her husband, U.S. Marine Kevin Lee Green, 22, of beating her for refusing sex. Kevin Green insisted he’d gone to get a hamburger and saw a man loitering near their apartment, but jurors didn’t believe him. For more than 16 years he sat in prison – as Parker eluded justice. Then in 1996, investigators gained access to a new DNA database featuring samples of 65,000 convicted criminals. The same name – Gerald Parker – popped up for six unsolved Orange County murders, including the attack that killed Dianna Green’s unborn child. Parker, in prison at the time for a parole violation, confessed to all six attacks. In 1998, he was convicted of six counts or rape, six counts of first-degree murder and one count of first-degree attempted murder. He was sentenced to death, and remains on death row. ‘America’s Little Girl’  Who: Alejandro Avila When: 2002 Where: Stanton What: Five-year-old Samantha Runnion finished dinner on July 15, 2002, and ran outside to play. She and a friend were playing “Clue” in the Smoke Tree apartment complex in Stanton, when a man drove up in a green Honda. He’d lost a puppy, he said. As Samantha approached, he grabbed her and threw her in the car. “Help me! Tell my grandmother!” were her last words. The next day, hikers found her body off the Ortega Highway. “Don’t sleep. Don’t eat,” Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona warned her killer on TV. “We’re coming after you.” President George W. Bush ordered federal resources available and more than 100 FBI agents joined 300 Orange County sheriff’s deputies in tracking the killer of “America’s Little Girl.” Investigators later found Samantha’s DNA, probably from her tears, in a car belonging to Avila, a Lake Elsinore man previously accused of molesting two young girls. And they found his DNA under Samantha’s fingernails. In 2005, Avila was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. “I want you to disappear into the abyss of a lifetime in prison, where no one will remember you, no one will pray for you, no one will care when you die,” Samantha’s mom, Erin Runnion, said at sentencing. Samantha’s death accelerated statewide adoption of the Amber Alert system and led to the formation of Erin Runnion’s Joyful Child Foundation, which organizes Neighborhood Watch-style programs and safety campaigns. Alejandro Avila remains on death row. Yacht murders  Who: Skylar Deleon When: Nov. 15, 2004 Where: Newport Harbor What: Tom and Jackie Hawks were still alive when the 66-pound anchor plunged into the Pacific, dragging their handcuffed bodies across the deck of the Well Deserved, and over the stern with a fatal splash. Hours earlier, on Nov. 15, 2004, the couple departed Newport Harbor in high spirits. They’d put their 55-foot yacht up for sale to move to Arizona and help raise a new grandson. Now it looked like they had a serious buyer. Deleon had inquired about the $460,000 yacht a few weeks earlier. He’d taken a few rides, and was back for one last sea trial. The retired couple had no idea that he was an ex-convict. Or that he had no intention of buying their boat. At sea, Deleon and two accomplices subdued the couple and forced them to provide wobbly signatures on sales documents. A sobbing and shaking Jackie Hawks pleaded for their lives: “Skylar, why are you doing this? We trusted you.” According to testimony at trial, Deleon tied them to the anchor and threw the couple overboard. Then he grabbed a beer and a fishing rod, and went trolling. In 2009, Deleon and helper John F. Kennedy were sentenced to death. Alonso Machain, another accomplice, was sentenced to 20 years, 4 months. Deleon’s wife, Jennifer Deleon, who participated in the planning, was sentenced to life in prison. Leading man  Who: Daniel Wozniak When: May 21-22, 2010 Where: Costa Mesa What: Hours before Wozniak took the stage on the night of May 22, 2010, the actor beheaded a man and tossed the severed head in a public park. It was all part of an elaborate murder plot that the leading man scripted for himself – to pay for his upcoming wedding. Wozniak planned to marry his co-star Rachel Buffett, a former Disneyland princess, at the end of the month. But he was too broke to pay for the beachside ceremony and honeymoon. Prosecutors say he hatched a double-murder plot to drain his neighbor’s bank account of $60,000 – and throw police off his scent. First he lured his neighbor, Sam Herr, 26, of Costa Mesa, to a deserted attic and shot him twice in the head. Then, using Herr’s cellphone, police say Wozniak lured mutual friend Julie Kibuishi to Herr’s apartment, where Wozniak shot her twice in the head – and attempted to frame Herr for the attack. Then, to hide all evidence of Herr’s murder, Wozniak cut off Herr’s head and hands and tossed them in El Dorado Park in Long Beach. That night, Wozniak starred in the musical “Nine” at the Hunger Artists Theatre Company in Fullerton with his fiancée, Rachel Buffett. Woniak’s plan soon unraveled as police traced withdrawals from Herr’s ATM back to Wozniak. Costa Mesa police arrested him at his bachelor party. In December, a jury convicted Wozniak of the two murders and recommended the death penalty. He awaits sentencing in March. His former fiancée Buffett awaits trial on charges of accessory to crimes after the fact. Seal Beach shooter  Who: Scott Dekraai When: Oct. 12, 2011 Where: Seal Beach What: On the morning of Oct. 12, 2011, a balding, overweight man sat in the sand at Bolsa Chica State Beach – in a bulletproof vest. Embittered from a custody battle, Dekraai decided to kill his ex-wife. In doing so, he would commit the deadliest mass shooting in Orange County history. At 1:21 p.m., he entered Salon Meritage in Seal Beach and walked up to his ex-wife, stylist Michelle Fournier: “You wanted this,” he said, and shot her dead. He turned to manicurist Christy Wilson and shot her dead. Salon co-owner Randy Fannin tried to intervene: “Dude, you don’t have to do this.” Dekraai shot him dead. In full rage, Dekraai shot and killed customers Lucia Kondas and Michele Fast; and stylists Victoria Buzzo and Laura Webb Elody, whose last words echoed through the salon: “You don’t have to do this. Please don’t shoot me.” In the parking lot, Dekraai took aim one last time. He shot and killed David Caouette in his Range Rover. When arrested nearby, Dekraai, armed with three handguns and extra ammunition, blurted out: “I know what I did.” Dekraai pleaded guilty. His case took an unexpected turn after revelations that authorities secretly bugged his jail cell and used a jailhouse snitch to gain information about him. In March, 2015, Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals removed the Orange County District Attorney’s Office from the death penalty phase of the trial. The case was turned over to the state Attorney General’s Office, which has appealed the ouster. Dekraai remains in jail awaiting the penalty phase of his trial.

But they asked for their privacy as their daughter fights for her life. ""We are calling on community members who know the name of our daughter to please maintain her privacy by not sharing her name or photos in the media or on social media,"" the parents said. ""We would like the community to know that our daughter's prognosis is uncertain as she continues fighting for her life."" First Lt. Dale Hinz of the Michigan State Police Paw Paw post said the girl  was shot once in the head as she sat in a car in the parking lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant near 9th Street and I-94 at 10:24 p.m. Saturday. The girl was a passenger in the front seat of a Chevrolet Cruze driven by Mary Jo Nye, 60, of Battle Creek. Nye and her back seat passengers Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, and Barbara Hawthorne, 68, both of Battle Creek, were killed, shot multiple times, Hinz said. Also killed at that site, Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, who was driving an Oldsmobile mini-van. The girl was with her grandmother and the other women, and had attended a theater even earlier in the evening. A father and son were shot and killed in a car lot about 15 minutes earlier. The first victim was shot before 6 p.m.; she is recovering after surgery today, according to the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office.

""I think it was just really from the heart, very heartfelt and supportive,"" Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said of the phone call, which took place at City Hall and lasted five to 10 minutes. Hadley said Obama spoke to him, Mayor Bobby Hopewell, City Manager Jim Ritsema, Deputy City Manager Jeff Chamberlain and Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller. Hadley said Obama offered condolences on his behalf, as well as on the behalf of First Lady Michelle Obama and their daughters. He also thanked city and county officials for their leadership and offered up help from the federal government in the aftermath of Saturday's mass shooting. ""It was very from the heart,"" Hadley said of the president's phone call. Hopewell said the president sent condolences for the victims' families and thanked local law enforcement for putting an end to the shooting spree in a quick manner. Watch @POTUS speak on the #KalamazooShooting and keeping the American people safe. https://t.co/kwtfK65AFQ ""We rest in our bubbles sometimes and you have the feeling or belief that sometimes these (places) with bad things that are happening elsewhere could never happen here,"" Hopewell said, noting that mass shootings have happened about 40 times in the nation so far this year. Hopewell said this isn't the way Kalamazoo wants national attention. ""But we all wake up every day not being able to control the circumstances  of life, and I appreciate that the media has been so respectful of the community and I I appreciate the president has taken the time to recognize that Kalamazoo is important in this nation and that we are a great place."" Hopewell said he talked to the president about how the mass shooting is an unusual event for Kalamazoo, and that generally it's a place people choose to visit. ""We can't rush in fear, we have to keep going forward and persevere and see beyond the obstacles because I think there's a lot to see beyond the obstacles."" The suspect in Saturday's shooting rampage, 45-year-old Jason B. Dalton, of Cooper Township, is expected to be arraigned this afternoon on murder charges in Kalamazoo County District Court. Police and prosecutors alleged that Dalton's shooting spree began just after 5:40 p.m. Saturday when a woman was shot multiple times in the parking lot of Meadows Townhomes in Richland Township. Hours later, at about 10:08 p.m., police said Dalton fatally shot 17-year-old Tyler Smith and Tyler's father, Rich, in the parking lot of Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive. Then, just after 10:15 p.m., investigators said Dalton opened fire in the parking lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant on South Ninth Street. Four women were killed and a 14-year-old was critically injured. Dalton was arrested at about 12:40 a.m. Sunday in downtown Kalamazoo after a county sheriff's deputy spotted his car.

Dale Hinz of the Michigan State Police Paw Paw post. Hinz said he spoke with the girl's father Monday, Feb. 22, and learned that the girl ""came out of surgery pretty well,"" but faces a long recovery from the very serious brain injury she suffered. She was shot once in the head, Hinz said, as she sat in a vehicle in the parking lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant near 9th Street and I-94 at 10:24 p.m. Saturday. The girl was a passenger in the front seat of a Chevrolet Cruze driven by Mary Jo Nye, 60, of Battle Creek.

The family has asked that her name not be released, according to Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office. Undersheriff Pali Matyas said she remained hospitalized in serious condition and was in surgery Monday morning. Police have not yet released the name of the girl, either, but Hinz said she is the granddaughter of one of the women killed at Cracker Barrel, and had attended a theater event with them earlier in the evening.

Angela Loeffler of Buchanan said Mary Lou Nye, 60, of Baroda, worked at the daycare at Immanuel Early Childhood Development Center that her 3-year-old son attends. Loeffler said Nye was a pleasant woman who always cleaned the glass doors at the end of the day even though they would be covered by tiny fingerprints the next day. ""We saw her every single night when we said goodbye,"" Loeffler said, noting that she last saw Nye Friday, the day before she was killed. Loeffler said she thought she would know the person from Baroda who was killed in the mass shootings since it's a small town, but she didn't realize it was Nye who was killed until she got a letter from the daycare Monday morning at drop off. ""Everybody was just kind of like, 'this is so horrible,'"" Loeffler said. ""How random is this that they were there and that happened. I think everyone's still in shock."" Nye was one of four people fatally shot in the Cracker Barrel parking lot on 9th street near I-94 Saturday, Feb. 20.  She was visiting with her sister-in-law, Mary Jo Nye, 60, along with friends Barbara Hawthorne, 68 and Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, all of Battle Creek, and a 14-year-old girl who police have not named. They had eaten at the Cracker Barrel restaurant and had seen a show at Western Michigan University's Miller Auditorium. They had returned to the restaurant to pick up one of their cars when they were shot and killed in their vehicles. Of the five, the 14-year-old girl is the sole survivor, though she is in critical condition. She was thought to be dead and was on life support so her organs could be donated, but then she squeezed her mother's hand. Two more victims, Tyler Smith, 17, and his father, Richard Smith, 53, were gunned down in a Kalamazoo car dealership parking lot. Another woman was shot in a townhome parking lot. She is in serious condition but expected to survive. Mary Lou Nye's son Bart told MLive his mother and aunt stayed connected with monthly visits to get together in Kalamazoo. He said Mary Lou was the manager of the Michigan Secretary of State branch in South Haven before it was closed several years ago, and for the past six to seven years, she has worked at the daycare.

Among the dead is a 12-year-old girl, four of her relatives, and the alleged shooter -- who was also a member of the same family. Phoenix police have revealed that the alleged gunman shot and killed his relatives after setting portions of their home on fire.

The Apple Store on North Michigan Avenue was among nearly 50 locations worldwide where Fight for the Future, an organization that advocates for privacy for Internet users and opposes Web censorship, planned rallies Tuesday. A small group assembled for that rally late Tuesday afternoon proved unequal to a more vocal group of protesters, who had marched from the Thompson Center in the Loop to North Michigan Avenue. That group saw the media assembled to cover the Apple rally and quickly commandeered the spotlight. The protesters started chants against Emanuel and Alvarez, then several in the crowd got into a shoving match with police officers. Some of the demonstrators were knocked into the planter boxes that line Michigan Avenue. A small cluster of protesters huddled at Michigan Avenue and Huron Street, where they burned a small American flag and shouted profanities before continuing to march north. After the skirmish, only two or three Fight for Future protesters remained, including Jon Monroe, who said he drove downtown from Libertyville to participate in the rally. He said the others were ""scared off."" The Apple demonstration was set up to mark a week since a judge's order that Apple help the FBI unlock the cellphone of a gunman in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that claimed 14 lives and left 22 wounded. Organizers had encouraged protesters to turn their phones and tablets into protest signs and carry 10-foot iPhone-shaped banners reading ""Don't Break Our Phones"" to show opposition against the court order compelling Apple to help the FBI hack into Syed Rizwan Farook's work-issued iPhone. ""We're at a turning point, a fork in the road for if the government will have the precedent to have access to all of our private information in our phones,"" Monroe said. Protesters to rally across country to back Apple in battle with FBI ""It's just like after 9/11,"" said Kyle McDaniel, who also came out for the Apple rally. ""They said, 'We need to be able to spy on all of our citizens, we need all of their records. And companies … were like, 'OK,'"" ""It's bad that kind of thing happened, but it's worse that they're using it as a scapegoat for them to exacerbate the losing of our privacy,"" McDaniel said. Apple objected to the court order and posted on its website that it believes there are ""dangerous"" implications to creating a new operating system for the use of the government and that could set a precedent. Although it is possible to create a new operating system, Apple said the only way to make sure the tool isn't abused is to never create it. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a letter last week that the tech company provided phone data to authorities and made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI. ""We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create,"" he said. In a letter Sunday, FBI Director James Comey said: ""We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land."" lvivanco@tribpub.com tbriscoe@tribpub.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2016-02-23 12:30:06,"Rally set for Apple store on Michigan Ave. to oppose FBI case, Web censorship",,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/
104,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2016/02/stoic_kalamazoo_shooting_spree.html," Gallery: Several people dead in multiple Kalamazoo County shootings KALAMAZOO, MI - If anyone in a Kalamazoo courtroom was hoping for answers Monday from Kalamazoo mass shooting suspect Jason Brian Dalton, they left with none. The 45-year-old said little, his eyes staring blankly ahead on a video screen, as District Judge Christopher T. Haenicke read off the 16 felonies, including six counts of murder, Dalton faces in a shooting spree Saturday that left six dead and two others seriously injured. The hearing marked the first time Dalton has been seen publicly since he was arrested early Sunday. In addition to the murder charges, which could land him in prison for the rest of his life, Dalton faces two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight counts of felony firearm use. Dalton sat in a chair, wearing glasses and dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit Monday as Haenicke read off each of his charges. Dalton, when asked, requested a court-appointed attorney. Before Haenicke set Dalton's bond, he asked the married father of two from Cooper Township if he had anything to say or wanted to comment about his ties to the Kalamazoo community. ""I would prefer just to remain silent,"" Dalton responded. While County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said police don't know yet what prompted Dalton to go on the alleged shooting rampage Saturday, detectives who obtained warrants for his arrest Monday testified that Dalton made admissions when they interviewed him. ""Dalton ultimately told detectives under Miranda that he took people's lives on 2/20/2016,"" Kalamazoo Public Safety Detective Sgt. Cory Ghiringhelli testified before Dalton's arraignment. Police and prosecutors allege Dalton's shooting spree began shortly after 5:40 p.m. Saturday in Richland Township when he shot Tiana Carruthers multiple times with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun in the parking lot of Meadows Townhomes, off East G Avenue in Richland Township. Just after 10 p.m., Dalton is accused of shooting Tyler Smith, 17, and Tyler's father, Rich, as they were looking at cars at Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive. The Smiths were both killed. Minutes later, police said Dalton opened fire again, killing four women and critically injuring a 14-year-old girl as they sat in two different vehicles in the parking lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant on South Ninth Street in Texas Township. Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda; Mary Jo Nye, 60, Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, and Barbara Hawthorne, 68, all of Battle Creek, were killed in the shooting at Cracker Barrel. The 14-year-old, whose name has not been released, was in critical condition Monday at Bronson Methodist Hospital. In court Monday, Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Detective Sgt. William Sparrow said Carruthers was able to pick Dalton out of a police lineup as the man who shot her. Ghiringhelli testified that Dalton admitted to shooting the Smiths and Michigan State Police Detective Sgt. Bryan DeWyse said Dalton admitted to being at the scene of the shootings at the Cracker Barrel. When he was arrested in downtown Kalamazoo shortly after 12:40 a.m., police said Dalton had a 9 mm handgun in his possession. Following Dalton's arraignment Monday, Getting said the handgun police found on Dalton is believed to have been ""used in one or more of the incidences"" Saturday. He said police don't know yet if Dalton legally owned the 9 mm, but are continuing to investigate. He said police also are working to try to determine what Dalton's motive was in the shooting spree. ""We don't know why he did this yet,"" Getting said. ""... This is a loss of innocence ... This is a terrible moment in this community ""This is just a tremendous loss,"" Getting added ... and no one understands why it happened and that adds to the fear and the sorrow."" Getting said Monday police recovered additional evidence in their investigation during a search of Dalton's house on Douglas Avenue. He said he expects more evidence will come to light at Dalton's preliminary examination hearing, which is scheduled for next month in district court. ""This was not just a momentarily lapse,"" Getting said. ""... He walked up on these people and he shot them."" Haenicke ordered Dalton to be held without bond in the county jail until his next court appearance. Dalton is scheduled to be back in court March 10 for a preliminary examination hearing.

	Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Mark Zuckerberg, chief exec of Facebook, is the latest tech titan to voice support for Apple in its refusal to help U.S. law enforcement crack a suspected terrorist’s iPhone. “We’re sympathetic with Apple on this one,” Zuckerberg said, speaking at the Mobile World Congress conference Monday in Spain, according to the Wall Street Journal. “I don’t think requiring back doors into encryption is either going to be an effective way to increase security or is really the right thing to do.” While Zuckerberg acknowledged that Internet companies have an obligation to help thwart terrorism, he said, “We believe in encryption, and we think that that’s an important tool that honestly people are going to find a way to get anyway.”  In a case with major digital-privacy implications, Apple is refusing to comply with a U.S. federal judge’s order that it assist the FBI in accessing data on an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last December. Popular on Variety Apple CEO Tim Cook last week issued a defiant open letter on the matter, arguing that the Department of Justice wants the company to create a “backdoor” — which does not currently exist — that would threaten the security of millions of iPhones. Apple says it has complied with FBI requests for help in the case as fully as it is able. In a court filing, the DOJ said Apple’s refusal to comply with the order was driven by concerns over marketing and its business model. Google and Twitter are among the Silicon Valley firms that are standing with Apple on the issue. Americans are divided, with most supporting the U.S. government’s position. According to a Pew Research Center survey released Monday, 51% of those surveyed said Apple should unlock the iPhone to assist the ongoing FBI investigation, while 38% said Apple should not in order to ensure the security of other users’ information; 11% did not have an opinion.

Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us. On a Monday afternoon conference call with reporters, a group of Uber executives stressed that the company was “devastated” by the mass shooting committed this past weekend by an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, Mich., and added that the company had done all it could in working with law enforcement both before and after the capture of suspect Jason Dalton. Chief Uber spokesperson Rachel Whetstone opened the call by saying that “our company has been heartbroken by this senseless violence,” and then introducing Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan, who was poached from Facebook last year. Given the scrutiny on Uber’s background checks, which controversially do not use fingerprint scans, Sullivan opened his remarks by emphasizing that “as the local police have made clear, the perpetrator had no criminal record … past behavior may not indicate how people will behave in the future.” Because Uber’s background checks couldn’t have caught Dalton, who had no record, Sullivan said that Uber does not plan to substantially change its safety and driver-screening practices going forward. “We’re deeply committed to the safety of everyone on our platform … we have a clear policy that prohibits firearms in the vehicle,” Sullivan said. “I don’t think that we will change our screening processes of Uber drivers as a result of this incident.” Though the company has “ongoing efforts from a tech standpoint,” Sullivan sharply denied that the company had plans to introduce something like the “panic” button that it has rolled out in markets outside the United States, like India. Sullivan was joined on the call by two members of Uber’s Safety Advisory Board: Lawyer and ex-Justice Department official Margaret Richardson and former Boston police chief Mark Davis. Davis was particularly vocal about the limits of what Uber could do in emergency response situations. In response to a question about an Uber passenger’s call to 911 about Dalton’s erratic driving, Davis argued that 911 is always the most effective first responder in the U.S. “You don’t want to confuse people about who they should be notifying. … you need to get police who … are close to the incident directly responding to it,” Davis said. Background checks and what Uber could have possibly done to have caught Dalton ahead of or during the shootings were the dominant topic of the call, and Sullivan, Davis and Richardson all offered different reasons for why Uber’s screening process works just fine. “No background checks process would have made a difference in this case because the person had no criminal history,” Sullivan suggested. “I disagree with the assertion that [a fingerprint check] is necessarily or could even be better than the process we have adopted.” Davis added, “The system that Uber has is extremely safe. The idea that you could simply have someone look at someone, and that they could determine that they were about to have a psychotic episode, is a faulty theory.” When Richardson chimed in, she made a direct connection to America’s lax gun control legislation, and noted the media scrutiny on Dalton’s work as an Uber driver instead of other jobs he has held (Progressive Insurance confirmed to the Detroit News that he used to work there). “It could be every corporation’s worst nightmare. … In many ways, this focus on Uber is a distraction from the availability of guns in the hands of people who shouldn’t have access to them,” Richardson said. The company also revealed that Dalton had a 4.73 rating at the time of the shooting, which Sullivan described as “good.” Around the time the call was wrapping up, reports emerged that Dalton had confessed to committing the six shootings.

The proof is in the pudding, er, numbers: USA TODAY surveyed 14 Hollywood studios to determine the diversity of their announced 2016 slates, breaking down the data on 184 movies to be released this year. Each studio got a letter grade. Hint: No A's were given. USA TODAY's analysis shows a distinct lack of minority and female faces in films being released between January and December. Oy. Here's what the studios say. Here's why the prospects for diversity are so bleak. And here are some notable bright spots in 2016's diversity dearth. It's a dark time in Kalamazoo, Mich., where an Uber driver was charged Monday in connection with a mass shooting spree Saturday night that left six people dead and two others wounded. Jason Dalton, 45, faces six counts of open murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight counts of felony firearm. What we know about the case: Dalton, who doesn't have a prior criminal record, allegedly shot people at three different locations between Uber fares. The victims include Tyler Smith, 17, and his father, Richard, 53; and Mary Lou Nye, 62, Mary Jo Nye, 60, Dorothy Brown, 74, and Barbara Hawthorne, 68. If a judge won't let singer Kesha out of her Sony contract with producer Dr. Luke, her fans hope money will. A fan set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise $2 million to buy Kesha Rose Sebert out of her contract. It takes the widely trending #FreeKesha one step further. A New York judge last week ruled against releasing Kesha from her contract, after she sued Dr. Luke (real name: Lukasz Gottwald) in 2014 for ongoing abuse, including drugging and raping her a decade ago. Separately, Taylor Swift donated $250,000 to Kesha ""to help with any of her financial needs during this trying time,"" Swift's spokesperson Tree Paine said. Did you watch Jeb Bush announcing the suspension of his campaign over the weekend? It's really sad. We feel bad for the guy. This man is a Bush. This man had donors and endorsements. It was all for naught. We know why, of course. To put it mildly, this is ""not the year for an establishment candidate,"" notes George H.W. Bush biographer Timothy Naftali. Instead, it’s the year for a man who fits perfectly into Game of Thrones. Onward to Nevada. There's a lot happening at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, from the unveiling of the Samsung Galary S7 to all the talk about virtual reality. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is especially excited for the latter, saying it has the potential to be ""the most social platform.""

Barbara Hawthorne, 68, was one of four people fatally shot in the Cracker Barrel parking lot on 9th street near I-94 Saturday, Feb. 20. Six people died in the rampage and two were injured. In the statement, the family says Hawthorne was deeply loved and respected and will be missed by all who knew her. ""We are devastated and bewildered that our 'Auntie Barb' was taken from us in such a horrible and senseless way,"" Hawthorne's family said in the statement. The family goes on to say Hawthorne was a ""true hippie"" who marched for civil rights in the south and recycled ""everything that came through the house."" ""She loved the theater and live music and shared tickets to performances whenever possible,"" the statement read.""Her table was often surrounded by her Euchre or crochet group. She believed in authentic connection and built her own family among her many friends and loved ones."" Hawthorne was visiting with three friends, Mary Jo Nye, 60, Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, all of Battle Creek, and a 14-year-old girl who police have not named. They had eaten at the Cracker Barrel restaurant and had seen a show at Western Michigan University's Miller Auditorium. They had returned to the restaurant to pick up one of their cars when they were shot and killed in their vehicles. Of the five, the 14-year-old girl is the sole survivor, though she is in critical condition. She was thought to be dead and was on life support so her organs could be donated, but then she squeezed her mother's hand. Two more victims, Tyler Smith, 17, and his father, Richard Smith, 53, were gunned down in a Kalamazoo car dealership parking lot. Another woman was shot in a townhome parking lot. She is in serious condition but expected to survive. Emily Monacelli is a reporter for MLive.com.

111,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2016/02/mass_shooting_suspect_did_not.html," Gallery: Several people dead in multiple Kalamazoo County shootings KALAMAZOO, MI - The man accused of killing six people at random during a shooting spree in Kalamazoo did not have a license to carry a concealed weapon, authorities said. Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Pali Matyas said he confirmed Tuesday Jason B. Dalton, 45, is not a concealed pistol license holder. That confirmation answers one of several questions that have surrounded Dalton since he was arrested Sunday morning in connection with a shooting rampage Saturday that left six people dead and two others, including a 14-year-old girl, seriously injured. For example, Matyas said he doesn't know how many guns Dalton had registered to him at his Cooper Township home and investigators have not said when Dalton purchased the alleged murder weapon - a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun - or whether the gun was properly registered and owned legally. ""As part of their investigation, the police will be looking at whether he legally owned the firearm that was seized ... as well as any other firearms that may have been seized during the course of this investigation,"" Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said. ""... In addition to the gun that was seized, there were other items of evidentiary value seized from his person and the car."" Dalton, who is being held without bond in the Kalamazoo County Jail, appeared via video in district court Monday, where he was arraigned on six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight counts of felony firearm use. Detectives who obtained an arrest warrant for Dalton prior to his arraignment said Dalton admitted to fatally shooting a father and son from Mattawan at 10:08 p.m. in the parking lot of Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive. He also admitted to being at the scene of a shooting at 10:24 p.m. at a Cracker Barrel restaurant a few miles from there, where four women were killed and a 14-year-old girl was critically injured. Additionally, detectives said Tiana Carruthers, who was shot multiple times outside The Meadows townhomes on East G Avenue in Richland Township at 5:42 p.m. Saturday, later identified Dalton in a police lineup as the man who shot her. The detectives' testimony Monday shed no light on why Dalton, who did not have a criminal history, allegedly went on the shooting rampage and Dalton provided no clues when he was in court. Getting also said Monday that investigators do not know Dalton's motive. After the shooting in Richland Township, the next round of gunfire came after 10 p.m. when police say Dalton shot and killed 17-year-old Tyler Smith, of Mattawan, and Tyler's father, Rich Smith, 53. A little more than 15 minutes later, police say, Dalton shot and killed Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, and Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74; Barbara Hawthorne, 68, and Mary Jo Nye, 60 in the Cracker Barrel parking lot. Abigail Kopf, 14, was also wounded in the shooting at the Cracker Barrel. She was listed in critical condition at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo following the shooting. On Monday, Abigail's parents, Gene and Vicki, said their daughter is ""fighting for her life."" Rex Hall Jr. is a reporter for MLive.com. You can reach him at rhall2@mlive.com. Follow him on Twitter.

116,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2016/02/15_guns_seized_from_kalamazoo.html," Gallery: Several people dead in multiple Kalamazoo County shootings KALAMAZOO, MI - Investigators seized 15 guns -- 11 long guns and four handguns -- from the house of Jason Brian Dalton, the Cooper Township man accused of killing six people Saturday during a deadly shooting spree in Kalamazoo, an official from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said. Meanwhile, authorities also confirmed that the 9 mm handgun police believe Dalton used during the mass shooting was purchased in mid-2015. Federal investigators know where Dalton, 45, purchased the gun, but ATF Special Agent and spokesman Donald Dawkins declined to release that information Wednesday. Dalton's house at 7031 Douglas Ave. was searched by sheriff's deputies and Kalamazoo Public Safety crime lab technicians Sunday after he was arrested in connection with the mass shooting, which killed six and seriously injured two others, including a 14-year-old girl. The 9 mm handgun was found by police in Dalton's Chevrolet HHR after they took him into custody at about 12:40 a.m. Sunday in downtown Kalamazoo. Police have said the handgun was registered to Dalton and owned legally, although he did not have a license to carry a concealed pistol. Detectives have said that after his arrest Dalton admitted to fatally shooting Tyler Smith, 17, and Tyler's father, Rich, 53, both of Mattawan, at 10:08 p.m. Saturday in the parking lot of Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive. He also admitted to being at the scene of a shooting at 10:24 p.m. at a Cracker Barrel restaurant a few miles from there, where Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, and Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74; Barbara Hawthorne, 68, and Mary Jo Nye, 60, all of Battle Creek, were killed. The shooting at the Cracker Barrel also critically injured 14-year-old Abigail Kopf. Police said Dalton's alleged shooting spree began at 5:42 p.m. that day when Tiana Carruthers was shot multiple times outside The Meadows townhomes on East G Avenue in Richland Township. Carruthers was able to provide a description of the man who shot her, as well as his vehicle. Detective said Carruthers later identified Dalton in a police lineup as the man who shot her. Investigators have said ballistics testing is being done on the handgun to determine if it was used at each shooting scene. They said the caliber of shell casings found at each scene was 9 mm. Meanwhile, Dawkins said federal investigators have traced each of the 15 guns that were found inside Dalton's house and are waiting to receive that information. The tracing of the weapons will show investigators who purchased each weapon, when each weapon was purchased and where each weapon was purchased, among other things, he said. Dalton is being held without bond in the Kalamazoo County Jail. He was arraigned Monday on six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight counts of felony firearm use. He is scheduled to be back in court March 10 for a preliminary examination hearing before District Judge Christopher T. Haenicke. Rex Hall Jr. is a reporter for MLive.com.

117,http://www.mlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2016/02/gun_violence_and_wearekalamazo.html," Gallery: Kalamazoo in mourning after mass shooting It's personal now, Kalamazoo. As mass shootings have occurred throughout the country in recent years, Kalamazoo-area residents have watched from the standpoint of bystanders. That changed Feb. 20. When I first saw the headline ""Mass shooting in Kalamazoo"" in the early morning hours of Feb. 21, I thought an individual was shot during a church service -- to me, a more plausible scenario than an actual mass shooting in Kalamazoo. Days later, it still doesn't make sense. Six random people killed? Two more injured? The suspect, an Uber driver ferrying passengers in between shootings? A 45-year-old married father of two? As it happened, the shooting occurred on the same evening I flew to Florida to visit my parents, which means I've been watching events unfold from a condo along the Gulf Coast. The condo is on the 15th floor overlooking the water. Amid the sound of the waves and the mesmerizing view of sea and sand, it seemed surreal to be watching CNN and hear them talking about my hometown. Unnerving to see places and people so familiar -- the car dealership and Cracker Barrel restaurant not far from my home; the parking lot of a bar that my children have frequented; the local authorities I've chatted up and interviewed over the years. ""Too close for comfort,"" my sister said. As the Stadium Drive shooting occurred, her sons sat in a doughnut shop less than a third of a mile away. One of her co-workers was driving on Stadium at the time and heard the gunshots; it was only later the woman realized it wasn't a car backfiring. The entire region is shaken, and people are rallying around the hashtag #WeAreKalamazoo as a sign of unity. With pride, I can say it's this kind of response that does define Kalamazoo. From 900 miles away, I'm reading the reports of the vigils for those who died, the fundraising efforts for the shooting survivors, the moves by various organizations to promote healing -- from the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts offering free admission to the Kalamazoo Strong T-shirts worn by the Western Michigan University basketball team. I'm reading the messages and prayers posted on Facebook, and there's a true sense of a community that's coming together. It reminds me why I love Kalamazoo. For all the times I revel in how Kalamazoo successfully mimics a bigger city in regard to its restaurants, its arts and entertainment scene, its cultural offerings, it is times like these I appreciate how Kalamazoo also can act like a small town in its caring concern. This is a community known for its philanthrophy -- The Kalamazoo Promise is only the tip of the iceberg -- and it's an ethos that truly does infuse the community in ways large and small. Kalamazoo is a place where everyday acts of kindness are routine -- teenagers will open a door for a stranger; the person with only one item will get cuts in the Meijer checkout line; the lady down the street offers tomatoes from her garden. A few winters ago, my husband was driving a visitor from Germany through our neighborhood and they saw a car stuck in the snow. My husband pulled over and helped push the car free. Our German visitor was amazed my husband put in that effort for people he didn't know. My husband was amazed she would think it was any big deal. We watch out for each other. When I had a health issue last fall, I was shocked at the number of people who brought over dinner, sent cards or reached out to express their care and concern. In retrospect, I shouldn't have been surprised, based on all my years of seeing how Kalamazoo residents rally around people in crisis. We're good at this, and it's serving us well now. These past few days have revealed the true spirit of Kalamazoo -- and it's not the horror of a mass shooting, but the rising up of a community that refuses to be brought down by evil, that knows how to unite in times of trouble, that is skilled at comforting and embracing its members. Feb. 20 was an awful, wrenching day in the community's history. But the response since can make us proud. And it's that, not a senseless tragedy, that defines us and makes us Kalamazoo Strong.

The theaters are entirely in the village of Greendale, but Greenfield's approval was necessary for landscaping and parking improvements because the northern end of the Southridge parking area is in Greenfield. Greendale officials last month approved the theatre with little opposition. The proposed eight-screen theater will be built in a little-used portion of the parking lot next to Sears. The free-standing theater will have a patio attached to a restaurant with seasonal outdoor seating. Each auditorium will include a dine-in option. The theater will offer two super screens and a total of about 800 leather recliners in lieu of traditional seating. Patrons will be able to have food and alcoholic beverages delivered to them in each auditorium by using convenient consoles on the recliners to call for an employee. Marcus Theatres has ensured that the base value of the property will be $2 million with a projected value of $9 million by 2018. The company says the development will cost $10 million. Marcus Theatres wants to break ground at the site this spring and be open a year later, said Katie Falvey, vice president of real estate for Marcus Theatres, during a plan commission meeting last month. Depending on the success of the Southridge theater, Marcus may add four more screens to the building in the future, Falvey said. John Rasche contributed to this report.

Church Street, Bridgman for Mary Lou Nye, 62, who was killed in Kalamazoo. A daycare worker known as ""Miss Mary"" to her charges was one of six people gunned down by a suspect in the Saturday, Feb. 20 mass shooting in Kalamazoo. She was with friends, including her sister-in-law Mary Jo Nye, when the group of women was attacked in the parking lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant on 9th Street near I-94. The four women died in the attack; teenaged girl with them survives in critical condition. Mary Lou's daughter-in-law, Gwen Marchant-Nye, the wife of her son Bart Nye, talked about how his father was trying to hold up. ""The person who would've been best suited to help him get through the loss of his wife would be his sister, and the person who could have helped most with the death of his sister died in the car next to her, Gwen Marchant-Nye said. "" Losing his wife and sister both at once is a hard blow."" Bart Nye is a manager at Noodles and Company and lives with his family in Ray, Mich. He has made the 7-hour trip to Baroda and back to be with his dad every day since the shootings, with the exception of yesterday, when weather prohibited the trip, she said. This week, Bart brought back a bunch of Christmas presents he discovered that Mary Lou had bought for her young grandson. Mary Lou Nye was born on September 5, 1953 in Lansing, the daughter of the late Raymond and Hazel (Smith) McCarrick, according to her obituary on the Pike Funeral Home website. In, 1975, she married Christopher C. Nye, who survives. Nye retired after 30 years working for the Michigan Secretary of State in several positions, and retired as the assistant manager of the Benton Harbor office. For the past five years she had worked for the Immanuel Lutheran Church's Day Care Center in Bridgman. Survivors include her husband; son, Bart (Gwen) Nye of Ray Twp., Mich.; grandson Geoffrey Nye; siblings Roseleah Paradis of Clinton Twp., Mich., Joan Demorest of Republic, Mich., and Sue McCarrick. She was preceded in death by son Jonathan Nye in 1991 and a brother, Herbert McCarrick. Friends may meet with the family on Saturday at the church beginning at 10 a.m. until the time of the service.

127,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2016/02/kalamazoo_mass_shooting_victim_2.html," Gallery: Kalamazoo mass shooting victims Judy Brown BATTLE CREEK, MI -- A private funeral service for Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, killed by a gunman on a rampage in Kalamazoo last weekend, will be Friday but not at her church as originally announced. Because the family hopes to keep the service as private as possible, family and friends will be notified of the location, according to her pastor. No visitation is planned. Marian and Art Herriman said they plan to drive down from their Upper Peninsula home near Manistique to attend services for Brown, who has been Marian Herriman's friend since 4th grade. ""She was one of the most caring people I knew,"" Marian Herriman said. An employee of Guardian Finance and Advocacy Services until her retirement a year ago, Brown was dedicated to helping her clients with their legal and financial work, often making house calls on weekends if they needed help, Herriman said. ""She was just so conscientious,"" she said. Herriman said she and Brown had grown up as friends whose parents had neighboring lake cottages in Calhoun County. They attended Hillsdale College together, stood in each other's weddings and both named their sons Jeffrey Scott. ""Judy was just up here in the UP few moths ago and went to church with us,"" Art Herriman said. She loved Northern Michigan, so much that she had been considering a move to the small town of Onekama in the Northern Lower Peninsula, he said. The Herrimans learned of the Kalamazoo shootings while in church Sunday morning, when a visiting exchange student got a call from worried family in Frankfurt, Germany, who had heard of the tragedy. ""That's the first we heard about it. As soon as we got home, my wife had gotten a call from Judy's cousin, and was just starting to call her back when another friend called with the news,"" Art Herriman said. Brown was with a group of friends in the parking lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant near I-94 and 9th Street west of Kalamazoo, where they had gone following a theatrical event, when they were shot at 10:24 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 20. Brown and three other women were killed and a 14-year-old girl was critically injured. Just minutes before that, alleged gunman Jason B. Dalton had shot and killed a father and son at a Kalamazoo car dealership and hours before that shot and wounded a woman at an apartment complex east of Kalamazoo, authorities say. Dorothy J. Knight ""Judy"" Brown was born in Battle Creek, attended Hillsdale College and graduated with a bachelor's degree from Western Michigan University, according to the obituary on the funeral home's web site. While in college she married Edwin Reynolds, and after divorcing she later married Curtis Brown and moved to Nashville, Ind., where she lived for the next 25 years. After moving back to Battle Creek, she worked as a caseworker for the Area Agency on Aging at Burnham Brook, and also for Guardian Finance and Advocacy. Surviving are her children Jeff Reynolds and husband, Lorenzo of California and Rob Reynolds of Florida; brother, Bob Knight; sister-in-law, Betty Knight; nieces, nephews, granddaughter and great grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her parents, George Clinton Knight and Dorothy (Putney) Knight, founders of the former Knight's Appliances, and a brother, George Knight. Rev. Ann Ashby, pastor of the Unity of Battle Creek church, where Brown was a member, said Brown and Barbara Hawthorne, another church member who was also killed in the Feb. 20 shootings, were friends who will be sorely missed by the community. ""Both are loving, caring, always of service to everyone around the,"" Ashby said. ""I know they have been friends for a long time, and are part of a group of women who have spent a lot of time together in craft meetings, attending movies, and doing all sorts of thing to enjoy life."" Their deaths, she said, ""were very sad unexpected and shocking for all of us."" In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions in Brown's honor may be directed to the Humane Society of South Central Michigan, 2500 Watkins Road, Battle Creek, MI 49015 or the Bronson @ Home Hospice, 165 Washington Ave., Battle Creek, MI 49037. The Farley Estes Dowdle Funeral Home & Cremation Care, Battle Creek is handling arrangements. Rosemary Parker is a reporter for MLive. Contact her at rparker3@mlive.com.

PENSACOLA NAVAL AIR STATION, Fla. – For nearly 15 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and more than eight years since the mass shooting at Fort Hood in Texas, Pensacola Naval Air Station has remained an unusually open U.S. military base — until now. The nation's first naval air station and home of the popular Blue Angels flight demonstration squadron this month has enacted strict new, permanent security measures intended to separate the nearly 1 million tourists who visit the base each year from the thousands of sailors, Marines and other military employees who work on the base. Security experts say the surprising thing is that base has remained relatively open for so long. ""It appears they are late to the game on this,"" said Scott White, a professor of homeland security and security management at Drexel University in Iowa and former intelligence officer for the Canadian defense department. White said the previously open environment at the base is a rare reminder of different era. ""Nowadays every military installation is a potential target as is anyone in a uniform,"" he said. Base officials say they have worked through the years to prioritize safety while accommodating the steady stream of tourists. But Cmdr. Shawn Dominguez, executive officer of the base, said the base had to align itself with Department of Defense security standards that physically separate tourists and other unauthorized visitors from military operations. Dominguez, who has been at the base for only a few months, said it was unusual that the public had become accustomed to relatively easy access there. ""The base has been here for a long time and brings a tremendous economic benefit to the community,"" he said. ""But I think everybody understands that in this security environment, the changes are necessary."" The base now has separate entrance gates — one for military members and base employees and another for tourists and other visitors. The gates are about three miles apart. In the past, large warning signs made it clear that unauthorized people were not allowed on specific areas of the base and base security kept close watch on those areas. Under the new system, tourists will be denied access to military areas without passing internal guard booths and roadblocks. Visitors will also have to show identification and carry a visitor pass issued in their name. The pass must be presented to security officials at their destination. Anyone visiting military buildings or training areas must be issued a special visitor pass and be escorted. Thousands of tourists enter the base several mornings each week from March through October to watch the Blue Angels practice. The practices are often followed by pilot autograph signings inside the National Museum of Naval Aviation. Also located inside the base are two historic forts, which date to the late 1700s, a popular Civil War-era lighthouse, a sprawling military cemetery, an 18-hole military golf course and beach recreation area for active duty and retired military. Separating the tourists and recreational aspects of the base from its military operations has been complicated by the way the base is laid out with tourist and recreation areas near working military personnel, said Harold Saintcloud, the base's anti-terrorism and security officer. The Department of Defense media office declined comment on base security issues in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. The department also declined to comment on whether the situation at Naval Air Station Pensacola is unique because of the large number of tourists visiting the base each year. Retired Navy pilot Mikal ""Butch"" Kissick owns Wings Aviation, a military memorabilia and supply store just outside the gates of the Naval Air Station Pensacola. Kissick said his customer base is mostly Naval aviators who work on the base and that he isn't concerned about not having tourists passing by his store. ""This was long overdue,"" he said. ""I have often thought about how easy it was to get onto the base. They needed to tighten security.""

Johnson thought that they'd mend fences at work the next day. The two worked together at the lawn care company in Hesston, Kansas, but as Johnson's afternoon shift began, his friend was gone. The man told The Washington Post that he must have got to ""pick up his guns, I guess."" Around 5 p.m., the Kansas plant became the site of the country's 49th mass shooting. Johnson heard gunshots about that time and his boss yelled that someone had a gun. Later, co-workers said Cedric had been shooting at him -- but every bullet missed.""Every foot track that I took he was right behind me, all the way through the plant.""As he sat in a hospital in the small Kansas city, waiting to hear how his injured co-workers were fairing, he still couldn't understand why Cedric perpetrated the shooting, injuring 14 people and killing three. According to NBC News, the shooting lasted 26 minutes. It began when local police were dispatched to two eerily similar calls -- two people with gunshot wounds. The injured were shot in two separate nearby towns in this rural area of Kansas, 30 minutes from Wichita.Four People Killed, Including Gunman, 14 Others Injured In Kansas Shooting Rampage https://t.co/ox9pemFMVq pic.twitter.com/3UbGZNmdT4— BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) February 26, 2016Multiple Deaths, Injuries in Kansas Shooting Spree https://t.co/rhiKzM3Jh1 pic.twitter.com/UKWvW2q0d7— The Voice of America (@VOANews) February 26, 2016The shooter fired at people from his car in the towns of Newton and Hesston, ABC News reported. He hit two vehicles first, injuring one person. Then he drove to a spot near the highway and shot another person in the leg.

He shot one person in the parking lot and was then seen by witnesses ""entering the building with a long gun"" before he ""opened fire inside the building."" An employee named Michael Dellinger, 20, described the scene inside. He and co-workers had just left a safety meeting when he heard a popping noise, which at first, he thought nothing of. But then he saw Ford standing in the doorway to the parking lot. And he was holding a gun. He immediately started shooting at the paint line.""Then he turned toward our line. I grabbed the guy next to me and said 'Run, there's a gun.'""Everyone ran to the closest door. People were yelling around him, bullets pinging off factory equipment all around him. A fellow employee, Austin McCaskill, described the shooter as ""running through the plant just going crazy with a gun … just randomly shooting people."" The sheriff of this rural Kansas county, T. Walton, said that when police finally arrived on scene, Ford was ""actively shooting at any targets that came into his sights.""The first officer on scene went into the site of the active shooting alone. The officer, who's being called a hero and hasn't been identified, killed the gunman as he dodged a barrage of gunfire himself. The sheriff lauded the lone cop, who ""saved a lot of lives."" Five shooting victims are now in critical condition in local Kansas hospitals, one required surgery, and eight are in stable condition. For now, the sheriff's department have hinted that they've identified a motive for the shooting, and were quick to note it wasn't terrorism. After the shooting in this peaceful Kansas community, the gunman's criminal record and his co-workers' vague but pervasive feelings that something about was ""real off"" about him have come to light. Ford was a felon with a long criminal record, charged in 1996 with carrying a concealed firearm. He'd also been convicted on a number of charges in Florida, including burglary. Earlier this month, his live-in girlfriend accused him of assault. After he allegedly placed her in a chokehold, she told police he was an ""alcoholic, violent, depressed"" and ""in desperate need of medical & psychological help!"" Dellinger said staff at Excel have been talking about the shooting and the gunman's motive. He said the man gave him a ""bad gut feeling."" Whatever was going on, McCaskill didn't think it justified shooting people at work.""He was having a bunch of problems. But you don't need to go blasting up a plant because you've got problems.""

137,http://nypost.com/2016/02/26/mississippi-governor-declares-april-confederate-heritage-month/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Fox News Submit February 26, 2016 | 9:14am Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared April Confederate Heritage Month on a pro-Confederate website, following a path similar to other states’ in the past. Bryant’s proclamation was posted to the Mississippi Sons of Confederate Veterans website, but not to the governor’s site. He signed it days before legislators killed bills that would have either removed the Confederate battle emblem from the 122-year-old state flag or stripped money from colleges and local governments that refuse to fly the current banner. The Jackson Free Press, a weekly newspaper, first reported the proclamation Wednesday and noted that other Southern state governors have passed similar proclamations. Georgia designates each April as Confederate History and Heritage Month. The paper noted that the Sons of Confederate Veterans group is against the changing of the Mississippi flag and “pushes a revisionist history about the Civil War.” Clay Chandler, a spokesman for Bryant, said previous governors, Democrat and Republican, have issued similar proclamations for Confederate Heritage Month. “Gov. Bryant believes Mississippi’s history deserves study and reflection, no matter how unpleasant or complicated parts of it may be,” Chandler said. “Like the proclamation says, gaining insight from our mistakes and successes will help us move forward.” Symbols of the Confederacy have come under fire since the mass shooting at a Charleston, S.C., church last June. Dylann Roof was charged in the killings and had been seen posing for photos online holding a Confederate flag. After the shooting, South Carolina lawmakers and Gov. Nikki Haley removed a Confederate battle flag that had flown for years on the Statehouse lawn. Also since the attack, several Mississippi cities and counties, and some universities, have stopped flying the state flag, which is the last in the nation to feature the Confederate emblem — a red field topped by a blue X dotted with 13 white stars. Democratic state Rep. Ed Blackmon, a member of the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, said he has no problem with people honoring Confederate ancestors. “But, at the same time, I would hope the governor would consider that people have problems with the Confederate flag,” Blackmon said. Blackmon said he grew up seeing the flag used by the Ku Klux Klan as a symbol of racial oppression. He said: “That’s a part of history you cannot deny.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Jamieson was best man in Jason Brian Dalton's wedding and said it ""doesn't seem real"" that the friend he's known for 26 years could have shot eight people in a shooting spree that police say targeted random people. (Mark Bugnaski/Kalamazoo Gazette) KALAMAZOO, MI -- To friends, Jason Dalton was a good family man, who usually avoided confrontation, had been a good high school football player and was good at what he did, whether it was taking exams for his law enforcement degree or performing auto body work. They are in disbelief that their friend can be the man accused of shooting eight people, killing six of them, in a random shooting spree in Kalamazoo. The best man in Jason Dalton's 1995 wedding said it ""doesn't seem real"" that the friend he's known for 26 years could have shot eight people in a shooting spree that police say targeted random people. Andrew Jamieson said the allegations are ""very much out of character"" with the man he knew. They had stayed close up until they drifted apart in the past 15 years as their families' grew. They last spoke about a year ago. ""But as things are coming out in the news, there are a lot of things I obviously didn't know about,"" he added. Dalton, 45, of Cooper Township, is the suspect in a Feb. 20 mass shooting that killed six, injured two and spanned three shooting scenes across Kalamazoo County. Police say the gunman chose his victims at random, and say they still do not have a motive for his crimes. Several riders have come forward to say Dalton served as their Uber driver before, between and after the shootings across Kalamazoo County. Jamieson said he didn't know Dalton had recently started driving for Uber. In high school, Dalton was a varsity football co-captain, graduating in 1989 from Comstock High, just east of Kalamazoo. Before attending Comstock schools, Dalton grew up in Greenfield, Ind., where he attended Eastern Hancock middle and high schools. A teacher and coach in the Eastern Hancock district described Dalton as an ""average student and promising athlete"" who participated in the school's football, wrestling and track programs, according to the Daily Reporter in Greenfield, Ind. Jamieson said he met Dalton 26 years ago at a party when they were 18. The men bonded over common interests such as working on cars and riding dirt bikes. Jamieson helped them move into their house on Douglas Avenue in Cooper Township, and was Dalton's best man in their 1995 wedding. Jamieson said that after about 12 years of their friendship, they grew apart as Dalton and his wife started a family and Jamieson started his own business. Dalton was someone who would be cordial to people, but who wasn't outgoing, Jamieson said. ""He wouldn't go out of his way to make friends with people,"" Jamieson said. Dalton and Jamieson would occasionally go out and shoot targets or clay pigeons. ""I never once was ever concerned about going out and shooting targets or clay pigeons, that he would turn it on me or someone else,"" Jamieson said. Jamieson said he was surprised to hear police had removed 15 guns from Dalton's house since he never knew Dalton to have ""more than a couple"" guns. ""Not that I would ever expect him to turn them on someone,"" Jamieson said. ""It was never like that."" In fact, Jamieson said, it seemed to be the opposite. Dalton had gotten his law enforcement degree at Kalamazoo Valley Community College and was looking for a job as a police officer in the early 1990s. Jamieson said Dalton couldn't find a job as a police officer in Michigan or in nearby states, and he wasn't interested in moving far away for a police job. Instead, Jamieson said, he went to school for auto body work at WyoTech in the state of Wyoming, and was hired at BMW North American in New Jersey. Jamieson said he did well on everything, whether it was the law enforcement exams or auto body work. In his late 20s, Dalton got into insurance, and Jamieson said knowing auto body work helped him in his new profession. He held down jobs at State Farm and Progressive insurance companies, and eventually went to work for himself as an independent insurance adjuster who worked on contract for other companies. He was out on a work appointment about a year ago when he stopped into Jamieson's shop in Richland. ""That's last time I had seen him face-to-face or spoken to him,"" Jamieson said. One neighbor who declined to give his name because of the barrage of media attention following the shootings, said Dalton ""is a good family man. He's a good man. That's all I'll say."" Cooper Township Supervisor Jeff Sorensen said everyone in the small township is shocked. ""Everybody that I talked to that knew him or knew of him couldn't believe that this is the person who committed this heinous activity."" Mark Cottingham, owner of Visions Custom Cars & Trucks, told a Kalamazoo Gazette reporter he and Dalton bumped heads last September over an estimate Cottingham provided to a customer for repairs to a Kia Optima. Dalton said the job was worth less than Cottingham's estimate. The two squabbled in person and Dalton got into a screaming match with the owner of the car, Cottingham said. Cottingham said the shop's estimate prevailed. On his last visit to the shop, Dalton's demeanor had changed and he was more pleasant, said Cottingham and mechanic Wade Phillips. But Cottingham said he was curt and dismissive in a final phone call when told of the additional repair costs. ""He is the only guy whose boss I've called in 20 years and said, 'This guy is not representing you well,'"" Cottingham said. He said he was shocked to turn on the news Sunday morning and see Dalton's face. ""I hadn't heard anything that happened, and I go, 'It's that insurance adjuster. I wonder what he did? Cottingham said. ""And then it showed the story and I said, Oh, my goodness."" After watching the report, he said, ""Man, I'm glad I wasn't on his list."" Sorenson recognized Dalton as the insurance adjuster who reviewed hail damage on his pickup truck last September. ""It wasn't until Sunday that it clicked that it was him,"" Sorensen said. Jamieson said he and his wife were eating dinner at Martini's Saturday evening when they saw police lights race by the restaurant. About midnight, someone at the restaurant announced there was a man on the loose who had shot at least six people. ""I just thought, you know, another nutcase,"" Jamieson said. Jamieson said the next morning he started getting text messages from people wanting to know if it was true that Dalton was the suspect. ""I flipped on TV and there was Jason sitting there in a jumpsuit,"" Jamieson said. ""It just doesn't seem real."" Jamieson said he and Dalton had talked about people who committed mass murders as unstable. ""We used to talk about people that did that (committed mass murders), loose cannons. ""Jason would walk across the street to avoid trouble,"" Jamieson said. ""Literally. He was just not interested in confrontation at all."" While Jamieson stressed that he hadn't talked to Dalton in a while and didn't know of any recent stressors in his life, he said when they talked regularly he knew Dalton's marriage to be as normal as ""any mid-American marriage."" ""They didn't jet set, they weren't high rollers. They would go to work, come home, do their thing,"" Jamieson said. The couple has a 15-year-old son and a daughter who's 10, Jamieson said. Jamieson said when they last talked, they talked about how Jamieson's business was going well, and how Dalton's daughter liked to help him work on cars. Jamieson said he has reached out to Dalton's parents, but hasn't heard back from them. He said Dalton's parents encouraged their only child work for anything he wanted. ""I believe they instilled good value in him,"" Jamieson said. ""They're good, hearty people. They were always kind to me, always kind to all of Jason's friends."" Jamieson said he doesn't feel like he has a lot to offer to help people understand why Dalton could have gone on a shooting spree. ""I was the one getting in all the scuffles,"" Jamieson said. ""He was the one hiding behind the car. It just blows my mind."" Jamieson said the crime is unfair to the victims and their loved ones. ""Those people aren't coming back and that's so unfair,"" Jamieson said. ""Nothing from here on out could bring them back and that's permanent. That's the absolute worst.""

140,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/obama-reacts-kansas-shooting,"President Barack Obama on Friday offered condolences to the families of the victims of Thursday’s mass shooting shooting in Hesston, Kansas. Speaking at an event in Jacksonville, Florida, Obama noted that the shooting came just days after another mass shooting in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and called on lawmakers to prioritize action on gun control. “These acts may not dominate the news today, but these are two more communities in America that are torn apart by grief,” Obama said. “We cannot become numb to this.” Three people were killed and 14 others were injured after a gunman, whom police identified as Cedric Ford, opened fire in three locations, including the Excel Industries plant where he worked. The President said he called the mayor of Hesston, David Kauffman, Friday morning to express his condolences. Obama emphasized that the issue of gun violence was not getting the attention that it deserved and had “become routine.” He also implored the media to keep reporting on stories about gun violence. “I hope the media pays attention to this,” he said. “Once a week we have these shootings. And it doesn’t dominate the news and that has to change.” Watch below via ABC News:  Planned Parenthood is leaving the federal government’s Title X program, which funds family planning services for low-income people, due to… Following the ousters of the Homeland Security secretary and Secret Service director, and the withdrawal of the would-be ICE director’s… Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Monday called for ousted Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles to testify before… Non-members are still able to read comments, but will no longer be able to participate.

USA TODAY Woman charged with providing guns to Kansas shooter Earlier, Obama called Hesston Mayor David Kauffman while flying to Florida from Air Force One. The White House said the president offered his condolences for the victims and his gratitude to the off-duty police officer was first on the scene and acted quickly to save lives. The Hesston shooting, Obama noted, follows the Kalamazoo, Mich. rampage last week that left six people dead. “These acts may not dominate the news today but these are two more communities in America that are torn apart by grief. And I thought it was important for me to say something today because somehow, as I've said before, this becomes routine,"" Obama said. ""We cannot become numb to this."" It's not the first time Obama has challenged the news media to pay more attention to gun violence. After a shooting at an Oregon community college last October, he asked news organizations to ""tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports."" He also said he would speak out on every mass shooting and pledged to ""politicize"" the issue until Congress passed gun control legislation.",2016-02-26 15:27:44,Obama: Mass shootings should dominate the news,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com
142,http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/02/wife_of_kalamzoo_mass-murder_s.html," Gallery: Several people dead in multiple Kalamazoo County shootings KALAMAZOO, MI - The wife of mass-shooting suspect Jason Brian Dalton has filed for divorce. Carole Dalton filed for divorce in Kalamazoo County Circuit Court after her husband allegedly went on a shooting spree on Saturday, Feb. 20, that left six dead and two seriously injured. The couple married in 1995. Dalton's family had earlier released a statement: ""There are no words which can express our shock and disbelief, and we are devastated and saddened for the victims and the families of the victims. ""We cannot comprehend the grief which you are feeling, and, while it seems woefully inadequate, we are deeply sorry and are praying for everyone affected."" The Daltons have two children, ages 15 and 10.
Carole Dalton is seeking sole custody of the children and child support from her husband's 401k plan. The filing said that ""there has been a breakdown in the marriage relationship to the extent the objects of matrimony have been destroyed and there remains no reasonable likelihood that the marriage can be preserved."" Jason Dalton was earning $50,000 a year at Michigan Appraisal Company and also worked as an Uber driver. Dalton, 45, is facing six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight counts of felony firearm use. Police say he randomly shot people in Kalamazoo County. Abigail Kopf, 14, of Battle Creek, was critically wounded. She was shot as she sat in a car outside of a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Three others in the vehicle were killed: Barbara Hawthorne, 68, Mary Jo Nye, 60, and Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, all of Battle Creek. A fourth member of their group, Mary Lou Nye, who was in another vehicle, also died. Tyler Smith, 17, and his father, Rich Smith, 53, were killed as they looked at cars at Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive. Tiana Carruthers survived being shot while in the parking lot of The Meadows townhomes in Richland Township while trying to protect children in the area. A motion for temporary custody and child support that accompanied the divorce complaint asks for Carole to be granted custody of the children, with no ""temporary parenting time"" awarded to Jason Dalton.

144,http://www.ocregister.com/articles/perez-706031-informant-dekraai.html,"Trending: In a voice thick with emotion, one of Orange County’s most prolific jailhouse informants begged a judge for leniency Friday, citing his work against former associates in the Mexican Mafia prison gang. Fernando Perez, an inmate at the center of Orange County’s snitch controversy, faces a possible sentence of 25 years to life for a “third-strike” conviction on a gun charge. “This is the single most important day in my life,” Perez told Superior Court Judge Gregg L. Prickett. “I want anyone I ever affected (to know) I am deeply and sincerely sorry.” Perez, 34, once known by the nickname Wicked, said he began working as a jail informant for federal and local agencies in an effort to secure his freedom. “I have changed beyond words and now have the opportunity to make something amazing out of my life,” he said. The former member of Santa Ana’s 18th Street gang found himself suited for snitch work, with his ability to feign empathy for fellow gang members and other inmates. He then wrote nightly notes to his jail handlers, titling them “Operation Daylight.” Related: Go ‘Inside the Snitch Tank’ in our special section In October 2011, Perez befriended Seal Beach mass shooting suspect Scott Dekraai shortly after his arrest, calling Dekraai “bro” and bringing him hot water to make tea, according to documents filed by Dekraai’s attorney. Perez encouraged Dekraai to open up, as jailers secretly recorded more than 100 hours of their conversations. In court Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe McNally called Perez’s work as a jail informant “critical” in destroying the hold of the Mexican Mafia in Orange County’s jails. Perez’s testimony against a top Mexican Mafia leader and 100 other gang members has led to a series of convictions “like dominoes falling,” McNally said. Judge Prickett listened as local and federal prosecutors and an FBI agent praised the informant for nearly an hour in his packed Santa Ana courtroom. Prickett described the case as “unique.” He then postponed sentencing to Friday. The current case against Perez stems from his 2007 arrest for being a felon in possession of a firearm. In a separate case, from a 2006 arrest, he is charged with methamphetamine possession. Perez’s rap sheet also includes convictions for robbery, gun charges, possession of a stolen vehicle and enhancements for being a gang member. He has been jailed in Orange County for about eight years. According to court documents, Perez’s tenure as an informant almost ended before it began around 2001. His confidential informant card contains the notation, by an Anaheim detective: “Terminated as a CI. Do not use.” Perez was caught keeping a gun at his home. Around 2009, Perez – a rising Mexican Mafia member – took another shot at working as an informant after his conviction in the third-strike gun case. The prosecutor on the case presented Perez to a jury as a liar and a hardened criminal. Later, after Perez became an informant, the same prosecutor described Perez in a future court appearance as a credible informant who turned his life around, according to court records. During his time behind bars, Perez provided information about pending attacks on jail inmates and sheriff’s deputies, saving about 11 people from being hurt or killed, his defense attorney, Richard Curran said in a court motion. Perez also gathered incriminating statements in 2010 from community theater actor Daniel Wozniak, who was awaiting trial on double-murder charges. The following year Dekraai, the Seal Beach shooter, landed in a cell next to Perez after Dekraai’s arrest on charges of killing eight people at a hair salon. Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, who represents Wozniak and Dekraai, accused prosecutors of planting Perez next his clients in violation of constitutional law and then hidingevidence about his role. Prosecutors later agreed not to use evidence gathered by Perez in the two cases. The District Attorney’s Office also has said it would not seek any consideration from the judge for Perez on those two cases. Sanders has spent two years compiling and leveling allegations that police and prosecutors systematically used a network of jailhouse snitches on inmates who already had lawyers and then withheld evidence on those informants. After two lengthy hearings on Sanders’ motions, Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals in March removed the District Attorney’s Office from the Dekraai case, a ruling that is under appeal. Dekraai has pleaded guilty to the shootings; his penalty phase trial has been delayed indefinitely. For his efforts working with local police and federal agents, Perez has earned a place on the Mexican Mafia’s death or “hard candy” list, prosecutors said in court Friday. The informant is now in federal protective custody and will spend whatever sentence he is given looking over his shoulder, prosecutors said. “If you rat, you’re dead,” Deputy District Attorney James Laird told the judge. On Friday, Perez said he has risked his life to cooperate with the government and would like consideration for those efforts. “I no longer chose the easyway,” he said. “I chose the way less taken while others sit back and wait for their release.” Staff Writer Kelly Puente contributed to this report.

145,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-kansas-shooting-guns-20160227-story.html,"HESSTON, KAN. — Authorities say a woman has been charged with providing firearms to the gunman who killed three people and injured several others at a factory in Kansas. Prosecutors announced Friday that 28-year-old Sarah T. Hopkins was charged with one count of knowingly transferring a firearm to a convicted felon. She's accused of giving two weapons to Cedric Ford, who was fatally shot by police during the Thursday shootings at Excel Industries in Hesston. An affidavit says the Newton woman gave Ford a Zastava Serbia, which is an AK-47-type semi-automatic rifle, and a Glock Model 22 40-caliber handgun. Prosecutors say Hopkins knew Ford wasn't allowed to have a firearm because he was a felon. Ford was killed during a shootout with the police chief in Hesston, a town about 30 miles north of Wichita, after opening fire Thursday at the Excel Industries lawnmower parts plant where he worked, authorities said Friday. Ford also shot and wounded two people from his car as he drove to the site. Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said earlier Friday that Hesston's police chief, Doug Schroeder, was a ""tremendous hero."" Walton said between 200 and 300 people were in the factory at the time, and the ""shooter wasn't done by any means when Schroeder chased and shot him. ""Had that Hesston officer not done what he did, this would be a whole lot more tragic,"" Walton said. Authorities identified the dead as 44-year-old Brian Sadowsky of Newton; 31-year-old Josh Higbee of Buhler; and 30-year-old Renee Benjamin, whose hometown wasn't immediately available. All three victims worked at the plant and were killed inside the building. Walton said his office served Ford with a protection-from-abuse order at around 3:30 p.m. Thursday, about 90 minutes before the first shooting happened. He said such orders are usually filed because there's some type of violence in a relationship. He did not disclose the nature of the relationship in question. Authorities on Friday said Ford had a history of domestic violence, including an arrest in Newton in November 2008 for felony battery and disorderly conduct. He also was arrested in July 2010, for driving while intoxicated and obstruction. The shooting came less than a week after a man opened fire at several locations in the Kalamazoo, Michigan, area, leaving six people dead and two severely wounded. Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive in those attacks. The suspect remains in custody.Associated Press CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2016-02-27 10:37:00,Woman charged with providing guns to Kansas mass shooting suspect,,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/

Ford's ex-girlfriend Sarah Jo Hopkins, 28, was charged with transfer of a firearm to a prohibited person on Friday. An affidavit states that she transferred a Zastava Serbia AK-47 and a Glock Model 22 .40-caliber handgun to Ford while knowing he was a convicted felon.
Advertisement The weapons were the same ones used when Ford shot 17 people at Excel industries before being killed in a shootout with police on Thursday. Hopkins told the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives she bought the guns at a pawn shop in 2014 and kept them at a home she and Ford shared for a period of time. She then moved out of the shared residence in July 2015 and left the guns with Ford, despite being aware of his criminal history. She was able to get the weapons back with police help, but returned them to Ford in August 2015 after he threatened her. Hopkins could face up to 10 years in federal prison and a fine of $250,000 if convicted.

Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us. That’s a mighty thin line you’re walking, Mr. Levchin! Max Levchin, the Affirm CEO and Paypal founder, was interviewed by Charlie Rose Friday night and shared a somewhat surprising stance on Apple’s legal battle with the FBI. Levchin said he wants Apple to help government officials gather data from a locked iPhone that was used by terrorists responsible for a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., back in December. This is the opposite viewpoint of many of Silicon Valley’s other prominent tech leaders, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. “I ultimately hope that this propels its way to the Supreme Court very quickly, and the Supreme Court actually tells Apple, ‘You are compelled to open this phone up,’ Levchin said during the interview. “I personally want to see this case in front of the FBI with every bit of evidence so that they have access to whatever information they need to make sure my kids are safe.” Buuut … there’s a catch. Levchin wants Apple to help just this once, and has a plan for how to avoid setting a precedent for companies breaking through their own security measures at every government request. It hinges on the recent death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and the unusual political situation his absence causes. “We have a four against four court, which means it doesn’t set precedent,” he explained. “The court can compel Apple to open this one phone, and then it still goes in front of Congress. And we still have the public debate, and we still fundamentally decide what society would want to be.” Well. That’s one scenario.

Patricia Arquette, Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston, and others will add a specific piece of jewelry to their wardrobes for the night, as they promote a campaign against gun violence in the United States. “This awards season, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence is teaming up with Hollywood to lift up the stories of the 90 Americans killed every day by gun violence,” a press release from the campaign states. “On the red carpet, high-profile celebrities … will join the effort to shed light on the human cost of gun violence by wearing unique, hand-crafted bracelets that commemorate Americans killed or injured by gun violence.” The bracelets – decorated in a simple black and gold design – are a part of Brady’s #ENOUGH campaign which encourages celebs and other influencers in the entertainment industry to call attention to the “critical need” to stop gun violence. (For more information, go to SayEnough.org.) The Brady campaign advocates a specific background check that prevents “convicted felons, domestic abusers, and fugitives” from owning the weapon. It also remembers victims whose lives were cut short by gun violence.

David Wayne Campbell, 51, shot and killed himself Friday in front of police who said they tried for more than three hours to get him to surrender, said Mason County Coroner Wes Stockwell. In an outbuilding on the remote, wooded property near Belfair, southwest of Seattle, authorities found four bodies, including those of his wife of six years, Lana J. Carlson, 49, and her sons, Quinn Carlson, 16, and Tory Carlson, 18. Stockwell withheld the identity of the fourth victim pending notification of relatives. On Friday morning, Campbell called a police officer he knew and reported that he had shot his family. The officer traveled across Puget Sound from Seattle and responded to the home, as did a Mason County SWAT team. For 3½ hours, a deputy sergeant tried to persuade the man to surrender, but he finally walked outside and shot himself, the Sheriff's Office said. A 12-year-old girl was able to escape the house. She was taken to a hospital but had not been shot, authorities said. ""Apparently she's okay,"" Chief Deputy Ryan Spurling said. ""I don't know if this is a daughter, or stepdaughter, or what the relationship is, but she escaped from the house."" Jack Pigott, who lives down the road, said he heard gunshots Thursday night but none Friday. Campbell and Carlson were married in November 2009, King County records show. The wife had two teenage sons who were adopted from Russia during a previous marriage, Pigott said, as well as a daughter who was adopted from China. Her first husband died of cancer, he said. Campbell ran a business called Campbell Family Heating and Air Conditioning, according to state records, while Carlson — who also went by Lana Jane Campbell — had registered a business called Crispy Edges. She had purchased a food truck, and she and Campbell had been working on it.

154,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2016/02/shooting_victim_mary_jo_nye_re.html," Gallery: Family and friends honor Mary Jo Nye at memorial service BATTLE CREEK, MI -- A weekend of memorial services and celebrations of the lives of those slain in Kalamazoo's mass shooting closed Sunday as hundreds gathered to remember Mary Jo Nye. ""My time with Mary Jo has been only three years, but I count every minute of it a blessing,"" Pastor Chad Parmalee of Chapel Hill United Methodist Church said to open Sunday afternoon's service there. Nye was killed in a Feb. 20 shooting spree in Kalamazoo County that claimed six lives, including her sister-in-law Mary Lou Nye, of Baroda. ""Celebration seems a difficult thing to even contemplate today, but a life lived the way Mary Jo's life was lived calls for celebration,"" Parmalee said Sunday during a service of scripture and song. Mary Jo Nye, 60, was born to Charles Manley and Joan (Cushing) in 1955 and with her six siblings lived on the family farm in Baroda, sharing chores, picking fruits and vegetables for market, and doing what kids do -- playing in tree forts, sledding down hills, running through the fields and making up games as they went. She grew fond of Lake Michigan. ""Mary Jo's love for the big lake began early in life and never faded. She loved Lake Michigan, she loved the shoreline. It brought her peace,"" the pastor said. ""Mary Jo said that whenever she saw the lake, she was reassured that things would just be okay."" She learned to cook, can and bake and to sew, quilt and knit from her mother and her grandmother, retaining that touch throughout her life and becoming known for her gifts of fresh-baked bread, cookies and handmade quilts. But she will remembered most for her dedication to learning. She taught English at Calhoun Community High School, ""Mary Jo knew reading was the key to success and made it her life's work to insure that whenever possible, the people she encountered could read and could write,"" Parmalee said. As a teacher, ""she had a knack for investing in children's lives in a way that made learning a contract between them. Her students knew that it wasn't a give-only kind of situation -- it was a give-and-take, back-and-forth exchange of information and relationship and trust. ""She found a way to teach even the kids who were the hardest to reach. Mary Jo could love them into learning."" But she too was a demanding, straight-forward mentor who gained the respect of her students by helping them learn to respect themselves, Parmalee said. During Sunday's service, students of Nye's shared their memories of her. One recalled how at 15 or 16 she cared little about applying herself at school, cutting class and showing up late, until Nye intervened. ""She picked me up every day and brought me to school, and I drove her crazy because I was always late coming out. She always told me, 'I'm not gonna pick you up anymore if you can't be on time,' but she always came back,"" Nye's former student recalled. ""She practiced what she preached. She taught me that there were people who cared, and that I needed to care, too."" Chuck Crider, former executive director of Calhoun Community High School, talked about how Nye's influence on students transcended the classroom. ""It was more than teaching. It was bringing things in from home for kids to wrap for Christmas to take to their families because they might not have anything,"" he said. ""The teaching was a given. The thing that sticks in my mind is that she touched lives -- she took kids outside of the classroom and challenged them to be their best."" One former student shared how he hadn't turned in a paper before graduation, and though he was passing the class, Nye wasn't going to let him graduate. As he walked at commencement, he was handed a piece of paper. To get his diploma, he'd have to turn in that paper, which he did three weeks later. ""She did that because she knew I could do better,"" he said. ""She was pushing me to be my best."" Parmalee, in closing the service, said of Nye: ""She challenged the people she knew, and in doing so, challenged the people she didn't. This can be a better world, with more people who can read, more people who have faith in themselves, more people who believe that there can be more by not giving up."" ""It would be a travesty,"" he concluded, ""for us to walk into this room, tell all these nice stories and then do nothing when we left. Let her life be an inspiration to you. If you can read, you can teach someone to read."" Chelsea Purgahn is a multimedia specialist for MLive. Follow her on Instagram and Twitter, and email her at cpurgahn@mlive.com.

Bernie Sanders’ home state has some of the most gun-friendly laws in the nation. It also has the nation’s lowest violent crime rate. The push to require universal background checks on gun sales failed almost immediately. But gun rights advocates didn’t stop with defeating background checks legislation. Vermont had only six gun murders in 2014, but according to statistics from the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it had 59 gun suicides. “We do have a small problem with suicides in the state. It’s not huge, like the anti-gunners say, but it is a problem,” said Ed Cutler, president of Gun Owners of Vermont, which labels itself a “no-compromise” gun rights organization. At the same time as they fought back against new regulations, Cutler and other gun rights leaders proposed a different approach: educating gun owners about suicide risk and how to de-stigmatize seeking mental health treatment. A year later, the state affiliate of the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of Vermont are rolling out a program to bring suicide awareness to gun stores, ranges, and clubs. They will also host training on how to talk to friends in crisis about getting help. “This is not an anti-gun or a veiled anti-gun campaign – this is strictly us helping ourselves,” said Chris Bradley, president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs, Vermont’s state NRA group. Experts from the state’s department of mental health have worked closely on the project, but gun rights groups are leading the public outreach. They have vetted every poster and fact sheet to make sure the suicide prevention message is not mixed with anti-gun rhetoric. It is a very different approach from the fight over gun laws and gun industry regulation that has become a key part of the presidential battle between Sanders and Hillary Clinton, in which Vermont will vote this week, as one of the potentially crucial Super Tuesday primaries. Nationwide, gun suicides represent nearly two-thirds of annual gun deaths. Public mass-casualty shootings like the ones this past week in Hesston, Kansas, and Kalamazoo, Michigan, represent only a tiny fraction of the overall toll. Nationwide, the group most at risk for gun suicide are white, middle-aged men. While gun homicide rates have remained mostly flat since 2000, gun suicide rates are rising. About half of America’s gun suicides involve a firearm, a means of suicide that is almost always lethal. Studies have found that many people act within less than an hour of deciding to kill themselves – and some within minutes of the decision. While people some who survive a suicide attempt will try again, 90% will not ultimately die from suicide. For many, a suicidal crisis can be very brief. That means, researchers say, that finding ways to limit people’s access to firearms in the midst of that crisis could be a key factor in saving lives. Educating gun dealers to look for signs of suicide risk is one line of defense. But many Americans most at risk already own guns. The approach being tested in Vermont is whether more education about suicide risk might persuade some gun owners to let their friends keep their guns for them when they’re experiencing depression or going though a divorce, a job loss, or another difficult time. “A lot of our members, they’re terrified they’re going to have their guns taken away,” said Cutler, the Gun Owners of Vermont president. He said he believes the focus on using laws to disqualify people with mental health problems from owning guns ends up discouraging gun owners from seeking mental health treatment at all. Taking a friends-helping-friends approach will work better, he said. “We can hold their guns for them, talk to them, get them counseling, and once it’s over and done with, we’ll give them their guns back and there won’t be stigma attached. “Gun owners trust gun owners.” Clinton, who has emphasized her willingness to go after the gun lobby to help prevent gun violence, has said very little about suicide. Her campaign policy page on gun violence prevention notes that “about 33,000 Americans are killed by guns each year” but does not mention that roughly 20,000 of those deaths are suicides. Her list of strategies to prevent this “unacceptable” death toll makes no mention of suicide at all. A campaign spokeswoman said Clinton’s support for expanding background checks and federal research on gun violence would help to reduce suicide, as would her support for improving existing laws focused on prohibiting people “suffering from severe mental illness from purchasing or possessing a gun”. The spokeswoman cited a study from the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety that found dramatically lower rates of gun suicide in states that require background checks for all handgun sales than in states that do not. But the study does not control for rates of firearm ownership. In an academic study that found a correlation between tough gun laws and lower rates of gun death, when the researchers controlled for the number of guns in a state, the link “essentially disappeared”. A spokesman for Sanders’ campaign touted the senator’s past efforts to expand mental health access, especially for veterans at risk of suicide, and pointed to his single-payer health insurance plan, designed to provide access to mental health services to all Americans. He also cited Sanders’ support for improving the nation’s background check system for firearm purchases. Sanders’ approach to gun policy has long stayed in line with that of his rural state, which has high rates of gun ownership and strong support for gun rights even among Democratic leaders. When universal background checks were debated last year, Vermont’s Democratic governor said he thought the state’s laws were perfectly adequate. Over the past few months, as Clinton has continued to hammer him on guns, Sanders has moved towards more gun control-friendly positions. Clinton has hit hardest on Sanders’ vote in favor of a 2005 federal law that protects firearm manufacturers, distributors and dealers against lawsuits over the criminal misuse of their products. In January, Sanders told reporters that he would cosponsor a bill to repeal this gun industry shield law. A repeal of the law could open up a new series of lawsuits by gun control groups seeking to hold firearms manufacturers and distributors responsible for monitoring whether their products end up in the hands of people with criminal records. In Vermont, the suicide prevention effort also focuses on gun dealers, but organizers are appealing to empathy and moral responsibility, not legal liability. Bradley, the president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs, said most gun sellers he knows have had the experience of selling a gun to a customer who later used it to kill themselves. “To say it weighs heavily on someone is a horrible understatement,” he said. On Friday, Bradley brought a stack of suicide prevention materials to a gun dealer in Barre, just south of Vermont’s capital, Montpelier. Rather than having the state’s department of mental health deliver the posters and fact sheets, gun owners are doing all of the delivery and education themselves. It gives credibility to the campaign, Bradley said – and makes it clear the materials are a service gun advocates are providing, rather than another mandated requirement from the state. At R&L Archery, a large, family-run outdoor goods store, Bradley waited while Jon Sanborn, the store’s vice-president, finished with a customer who would need to update his address on his ID before he could pass a background check. Then he spread out the campaign’s new posters on the counter and made his pitch. “The whole idea is to establish a dialogue,” he said. “I’m not a psychologist and you’re not a psychologist.” “Clearly,” Sanborn broke in, drily. Sanborn said he liked the materials designed to educate store employees about being watchful for signs of suicide. But he did not have a positive reaction to the poster designed to reach people at risk of suicide, which had “Thinking about suicide?” in red letters at the top. “I don’t love that for the front of my store,” he said. Ninety-nine percent of his customers, he said, would not be associating buying a gun with suicide, and he did not want to put that thought in their heads. But he said he did support the broader project of putting more focus on suicide prevention. “There’s never been any awareness on our end,” he said. “Warning signs – things to look for, that kind of thing, none of that has propagated through the gun world.” Most people have some kind of personal connection to gun suicides, Sanborn said, as well as knowing that they have sold a few guns to people who have used them to kill themselves. “It does cast the rest of our industry and the rest of our hobbies in such a negative light,” he said. “Any of the political speeches you look at – Hillary Clinton had one at the end of last year – 92 people a day are killed by firearms, and if you look at the number, those are true, but 60-some odd of those 90 are suicide.” He said the Vermont Gun Shop project was the first initiative he had seen to actually work through firearm dealers to tackle that problem. On Saturday, at the Snowsville General Store in Randolph, store owner Eugene Booska also said he was willing to participate in the new suicide prevention program, though he had not seen the new materials yet. Booska’s store stocks milk and eggs as well as guns, and is heated by an old-fashioned wood-burning stove. “They asked me if I would support, to help to pass out information,” Booska said. “I think it’s fine, and I will pass it out. I don’t know as it’s going to work very well.” Choosing not to sell one gun to someone who seems at risk might not prevent them from killing themselves, he said. “Most guys that I sell guns to have already got a lot of guns.” Booska’s wife, Kris, said she has sometimes trusted her gut instinct and refused to sell someone a gun, even if they have passed a background check. Firearms dealers always have the option to refuse a sale. But she also remembers selling a gun to someone who later killed himself, and she did not see any red flags. She remembers him talking about the death of his dog, and comforting him, but: “I did not have any inkling that he intended to kill himself.” If I’d been educated about what to look for, perhaps I would have seen something more that I didn’t see. Or if, you know, I had like a script of something you might say to somebody.” Vermont’s suicide prevention program is modelled on that of New Hampshire. In 2009, one New Hampshire gun store had three customers buy firearms and use them to kill themselves within the space of a week. The gun store owner began to work with public health experts to figure out what his store might have been able to do differently to prevent this tragedy. The result was the New Hampshire Gun Shop project, rolled out in 2011, which educates gun store employees about signs of suicide risk and how to use casual conversation with customers to check for red flags, as well as using gun stores as a place to spread public awareness about gun suicide and ways to get help. A study of the project found roughly half of gun stores in New Hampshire were displaying program materials. The ultimate effect of the effort on suicide rates has yet to be measured. But according to Cathy Barber, the director of the Means Matter suicide prevention campaign at the Harvard School of Public Health, variations of the New Hampshire model are being tested in at least 14 states, including Vermont. Ten more states are in early stages of developing the program, she said. Because gun owners and their families are affected by suicide at higher rates than non-gun owners, taking an anti-gun approach to suicide prevention is, as Barber often puts it, “like sending an anti-gay group to do a suicide prevention campaign in the gay and lesbian community”. Vermont’s leading gun control group does back the new suicide prevention campaign. Ann Braden, the head of Gun Sense Vermont, said she was delighted when she heard Cutler bring up the New Hampshire Gun Shop Project at a state hearing. “It was like the world had become all sparkly,” she said. Her group will continue to push for a state universal background check law in 2017, she said. But she added that it was “very refreshing” to have her gun rights opponents working on a prevention program of their own, “rather than a no to everything”.",2016-02-29 07:00:07,Vermont gun lobby bypasses Sanders v Clinton in attempt to cut down suicides,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

          / CBS/AP KALAMAZOO, Mich. - The condition of a 14-year-old girl is improving, more than a week after she survived a mass shooting in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Vickie Kopf posted an update about her daughter on Facebook. She says Abigail Kopf's ventilator was removed Sunday and that she's breathing on her own. Abigail was outside a Kalamazoo-area restaurant when she was shot in the head on Feb. 20. Six people were killed - four at the restaurant and two at a car dealership. Another victim shot at an apartment building survived. Jason Dalton is charged with murder and attempted murder. Funerals and memorial services were held over the weekend. The last was held Sunday at a Battle Creek church to honor Mary Jo Nye, a retired teacher who was killed at the restaurant. Kopf was initially believed to have been killed in the shooting. Michigan State Police say she was a passenger in a car Mary Jo Nye was driving. Vickie Kopf said Barbara Hawthorne, another passenger in the car who was killed, was a grandmother figure to Abigail, and the pair were regularly hanging out together. Abigail's heart beat stopped during initial attempts to save her life, but it was restored. An organ donation service was contacted with her parents' permission, though she was never declared medically brain dead. Her parents were making arrangements to donate her organs when the girl squeezed her mother's hand. Kopf told CBS affiliate WWMT the sensation of having her hand squeezed was ""breathtaking."" ""They then called in the doctor and he asked her a question and wanted a thumbs-up in response,"" state police said last week. ""And she gave him two thumbs up. It's a glimmer of hope in this otherwise tragic situation."" The Battle Creek Community Foundation is accepting donations to help the Kopf family cover medical expenses.

Loading... February 29, 2016 A high-profile fatal shooting of a civilian woman and a female police officer in northern Virginia this weekend offers a glimpse into one of the most common, and one of the least common, forms of gun death in the United States. Army staff sergeant Ronald Hamilton has been charged with killing his wife and Prince William County police officer Ashley Guindon, who was on her first day on the job. Mr. Hamilton, who worked at the Pentagon, has been charged with capital murder, first degree murder, and malicious wounding. Prosecutor Paul Ebert said he will likely seek the death penalty. The incident began on Saturday night when Hamilton got into an argument with his wife. She called 911, he fatally shot her, and he then began firing on the officers who responded to the call. Officer. Guindon died from injuries sustained in the shooting, the police department said, and two other officers were wounded. Within the larger national debate over gun violence in America, the case encapsulates two of the higher-profile forms of fatal shooting: that of an intimate partner, and that of a police officer. From 2006 to 2014 an average of 554 American women where fatally shot by romantic partners, according to an Associated Press analysis of FBI and state crime data, roughly one every 16 hours. Seventy-two percent of all murder-suicides in the US involve an intimate partner, according to the National Coalition against Domestic Violence, and 94 percent of the victims in murder-suicides are female. In 2015, the most common type of mass shooting involved the shootings of family members, according to a recent Monitor analysis. Meanwhile, some law enforcement officials have claimed that police officers are increasingly targets for violence. Citing FBI statistics showing that the number of officers ""feloniously killed"" jumped from 27 in 2013 to 51 in 2014 – the year the Black Lives Matter movement rose to national prominence protesting fatal police shootings around the country – some officials have blamed what they describe as anti-cop rhetoric from the movement for an uptick in violence against police. ""At any point where the rhetoric ramps up to the point where calculated cold-blooded assassination of police officers happen[s], this rhetoric has gotten out of control,"" said Harris County (Tex.) Sheriff Ron Hickman, after Darren Goforth, one of his deputies, was shot and killed in an ambush attack in August. But a broader look at statistics reveal that the increase in police deaths isn’t that alarming in context. The 23 officers murdered in 2013 made it the safest year for police officers in recorded history, said Seth Stoughton – a former police officer and an assistant law professor at the University of South Carolina – in an interview with NPR. In fact, 2015, the same year Officer Goforth was killed, was the second safest year for police officers, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks all police deaths.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

163,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/141447548/0/phoenix/nation~Mississippi-man-sues-governor-over-state-flag/,"JACKSON, Miss. — Attorney Carlos Moore filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to do away with Mississippi’s current flag. Moore filed the lawsuit against Gov. Phil Bryant. It asserts the state flag violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment and could incite violence similar to the shooting in South Carolina. “I got sick and tired of being a second-class citizen,” said Moore of the reason he filed the complaint. ""Time is of the essence for the removal of the current state flag from all public display on public lands and adoption of a non-discriminatory state flag because there was a recent mass killing ... by a young white supremacist who was a Confederate battle flag sympathizer and militant. USA TODAY Dylann Roof indicted on 33 federal counts ""... Similar violent conduct could occur any day in Mississippi,"" the complaint continues. Moore was referring to the mass shooting at the Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., which killed nine people last June 17. Dylann Roof has been charged with the shootings. Moore said he began researching options after several flag bills in the Legislature died last week by deadline. House Speaker Philip Gunn, who had called for changing the state flag last summer, said recently he could not find consensus in the House to move a bill forward. Mississippi is the only state with a flag displaying the Confederate emblem flying over its statehouse. A spokesman for Bryant called the lawsuit a ""frivolous attempt to use the federal court system to usurp the will of the people."" USA TODAY Poll finds strong support for Confederate flag among Trump supporters in S.C. Mississippians voted in 2001 to keep the current state flag via a statewide referendum. Bryant said last year that while he's not pushing for a change to the flag, 2016 would be a good year for another referendum on the issue. Moore's lawsuit cites last year’s Supreme Court ruling that declares states’ bans on same-sex marriages unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. Constitutional law expert Matt Steffey said there are some issues with Moore's legal claims. ""The 14th Amendment is not usually read to be concerned with symbolic matters, and the flag is by definition a symbol,"" Steffey said. ""And while the lawsuit attempts to tie this to violence, at least in a courtroom, there's no way to establish that."" USA TODAY Ole Miss removes state flag with Confederate symbol But Moore said he believes his argument is solid. “I’m convinced that the flag violates due process,” Moore said. “… It (the flag) is government speech, and it is hate speech.” Follow Kate Royals on Twitter: @KRRoyals",2016-02-29 20:41:37,Mississippi man sues governor over state flag,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Matt Finn reports from Hesston, Kansas A federal magistrate judge set a $10,000 bond Monday for the woman accused of providing the guns used in last week's mass shooting at a Kansas lawn equipment factory. More than a dozen family members and friends of Sarah Hopkins came to her first court appearance in U.S. District Court in Wichita, but they refused to talk to the media. Her attorney, Douglas Adams, declined comment. Prosecutors did not seek her detention, and court records show she later posted the bond. The 28-year-old Newton, Kansas, woman is charged with knowingly transferring a firearm to a convicted felon. Prosecutors say she gave Cedric Ford an AK-47-type semi-automatic rifle and a .40-caliber handgun that he used in the attack at Excel Industries in Hesston. Four people, including Ford, were killed and 14 others were injured. Hopkins told investigators that she moved out of a home she shared with Ford in July 2015. Police officers the following month helped her retrieve the firearms, which she had purchased, according court documents. Hopkins said at the time that Ford was a convicted felon who could not lawfully possess them, the documents say. She told federal investigators after Thursday's shooting rampage that she gave the guns to Ford in August because he had threatened her, according to the probable cause affidavit filed in the case. But the government contends Hopkins, who bought the guns in 2014, had subsequently pawned them and redeemed the rifle this month — months after she said she'd given the guns to Ford. Ford is the father of Hopkin's 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son, according a Harvey County paternity case. Adams told the court he expected Hopkins would be indicted Tuesday. Her next hearing is March 9.

(Facebook) (Facebook) KALAMAZOO, MI -- The first victim in a mass shooting in Kalamazoo Feb. 20 that killed six people and injured two has improved enough to have her condition upgraded to fair Tuesday, Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said. Tiana Carruthers, attacked at about 5:40 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 20, remains hospitalized, according to Fuller, who has been asked by the family to act as a spokesman for them. She had previously been listed in serious condition following surgeries to repair multiple gunshots, authorities said. Carruthers' age has not been confirmed, and details of the incident and her recovery have not been released at her family's request. The gunman apparently shot Carruthers in the parking lot of a Richland Township apartment complex, firing out the window of a vehicle, then speeding  off. She has been credited with urging children to run for safety, but details of what she saw and did are not likely to surface until the man accused of shooting her and seven other people is brought to trial, Fuller said. Jason Brian Dalton, 45, of Cooper Township, was arrested early Sunday morning, Feb. 21, and faces multiple murder and felony firearms charges in connection with the shootings. Fuller said her family continues to shield Carruthers from attention and distractions to her recovery, and has asked to be left alone to focus on on her while she heals. They have asked that donations intended for Carruthers be made through the collaborative community foundation HelpNow account, which victims to receive help through a liaison acting on their behalf. Fuller said some GoFundMe accounts that have been set up by people wishing to help Carruthers have no way of actually assuring the money gets to her, since funds will not be released until GoFundMe administrators have connected with an authorized family member. ""The family, as of last night, was comfortable having donations continue to come through the Kalamazoo Community Foundation,"" Fuller said,  which can immediately disperse funds as needed through a liaison appointed through the YWCA. There is no administrative fee associated with the donations to victims through the foundations, he said, and donors can specify where they wish their donation to be directed.

The number of background checks conducted by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System on people trying to purchase a firearm hit 2.6 million in February, down from a high of 3.3 million in December 2015, according to the FBI. February’s background check total was the third largest in history, also falling short of the 2.7 million conducted in December 2012 after the deadly mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The FBI noted that the number of background checks does not directly correlate to the number of firearm sales. The large number of background checks comes after a year of several high-profile mass shootings. Gun sales in America have historically spiked after a mass shooting, and there was a record number of firearm background checks conducted in 2015.

Tech http://fus.in/1oDtvsh Copied to clipboard The U.S. saw another tragic mass shooting Sunday, when Jason Brian Dalton, an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, Mich., allegedly shot and killed six people and severely injured two others for currently unknown reasons. It’s unclear if a more thorough background check would have prevented Dalton—who had no criminal record, but a spate of driving violations in his past—from driving for the service. But the shooting spree has resurfaced questions about the stringency of Uber’s background checks, which have long faced criticism for inadequately weeding out potentially dangerous drivers. According to Uber, “All drivers in the U.S. must provide their license and vehicle documentation before being able to drive with Uber. They’re also required to go through a pre-screening process that includes a review of their motor vehicle records and a search through criminal records at the county, state, and federal levels.” Uber does not fingerprint its drivers. In 2014, San Francisco and Los Angeles filed a suit against the company in 2014 over their security screening tactics, arguing that Uber’s methods allowed dangerous criminals to slip through the cracks. San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón said last year that because Uber’s background checks only go back seven years, “if someone was convicted of kidnapping eight years ago, and they were just paroled last week—they just got out of prison—the Uber background check process will not identify the person as a convicted kidnapper.” The New York Times reported at the time that according to the DAs, Uber employed 25 drivers with criminal backgrounds despite putting them through its security checks. And Gascón added that roughly 30,000 registered sex offenders weren’t listed in the database Uber draws from in conducting the checks. And earlier this month, the ride-share company settled two class-action lawsuits for $28.5 million that alleged that the company promised safe rides they couldn’t deliver. According to the plaintiffs, Uber trails far behind industry standards in terms of background and security checks, something Uber drivers have allegedly confirmed themselves. On a recent press call following the Kalamazoo shootings, Uber officials said they stand by their policy and don’t intend to alter screening processes. The Kalamazoo shootings also bring into focus a relatively new facet of Uber’s security measures: an anti-gun policy that appears effectively impossible to enforce. If Dalton was, as reported, picking up fares between shootings, he was violating Uber’s official firearms prohibition policy (emphasis ours): We seek to ensure that everyone using the Uber digital platform—both driver-partners and riders—feels safe and comfortable using the service. During a ride arranged through the Uber platform, Uber and its affiliates therefore prohibit possessing firearms of any kind in a vehicle. Any rider or driver found to have violated this prohibition may lose access to the Uber platform.  According to The New York Times, officers found a semiautomatic handgun that matched evidence from the shootings in Dalton’s car soon after the killing spree. Weapons prohibitions policies are generally hard to enforce, and Uber is not alone in banning firearms. Lyft, another ride-sharing service, has a similar policy, and New York City taxi drivers, operated by the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission, are not allowed to carry weapons in their cars. In all cases, no-guns policies for ride-sharing and taxicabs operate in large part on an honor system, making the question of enforcement difficult to answer and specific to the service. Uber adopted its no-guns policy as recently as June 2015. At the time, company representative Matt McKenna told The New Republic, “We have adopted a no-firearms policy to ensure that both riders and drivers feel safe and comfortable on the platform. We made this policy change after assessing existing policies and carefully reviewing recent feedback from both riders and driver-partners.” Up until then, Uber drivers and passengers were subject to state laws on carrying firearms. The policy immediately raised questions, especially in states like Texas (and Michigan) where residents are allowed to carry a concealed weapon with the proper license. In an online forum, Uber drivers discussed how to handle the new policy. One said: Being in Texas – having a CHL [Concealed Handgun License] myself, there is no way I’m conforming to this policy, and how am I supposed to enforce this with my pax? Seems like a BS policy put in place to pander to the media, I really hate when companies do this… I’m considering quitting and not using uber anymore when I travel, haven’t decided and in the meantime, I’ll continue to carry in my car. Another asked, “How is Uber supposed to enforce this? Afterall we are in Texas—more people than you think are valid and legal CHL holders. They’re treading on thin ‘independent contractor’ logic by making such a statement about 1) drivers who aren’t employees and 2) vehicles the company doesn’t own.” Another wrote, simply, “they can not enforce this.” Indeed, it’s hard to imagine how Uber would enforce its own policy given how the company operates: Uber’s primary selling point to prospective drivers is to be their own boss, using their own car to respond to fares directly, cutting out middleman managers and dispatchers who could conceivably check for guns in vehicles. Uber has let drivers go for violating the ban, but those cases all seem to have been brought to the company’s attention after a gun was fired: The Trace reports that at least two drivers have been fired after discharging their weapons in altercations with passengers. Evan J. Spelfogel, a labor attorney at the New York-based Epstein Becker & Green, P.C., who represents management in employment disputes, agreed that practically, this policy is more about providing grounds to terminate a relationship with a violator than it is about actual prevention. “Uber might announce this rule, but as you say it’s going to be very difficult to enforce,” Spelfogel said in a phone interview. “As a practical matter,” he continued, “if a driver or a passenger is in the vehicle there’s no way for anyone at Uber’s HQ to know that a passenger or a driver has a gun in his possession… you’re talking about a situation where Uber is going to be enforcing that rule, if at all, when an incident has occurred.” It’s arguable that the policy-as-deterrent model works best when the stakes are high: A New York City taxi driver risks their coveted and very, very expensive taxi medallion that they’ve paid for out-of-pocket by carrying a gun in their cab. And then there’s the question of the driver’s safety. Some Uber drivers contend that here’s little incentive to abide by Uber’s no-gun policy anyway because they say the company doesn’t do enough to protect its drivers. The Trace reports: One Reddit user who claims to drive for Uber tells The Trace he carries a concealed weapon on the job in full knowledge of Uber’s policy. “I carry because I would much rather lose the ability to work with Uber than be robbed, physically assaulted, or need to defend myself and be unable to,” he wrote in a message. The same Uber-driving Redditor also told the Trace he doesn’t expect Uber to watch out for his safety, so prefers to fend for himself (by carrying a gun): The driver… [argued] that Uber’s business model “relies on the low cost of drivers providing their own vehicles with very little need for modification.” He added, “I think they don’t really have any responsibility to protect their drivers. Every person is responsible for their own safety.” Employees who feel protected by their employers might not feel the need to carry a gun. The TLC, for instance, installs dividers between the back and front seats that would block violent passengers from attacking a driver. That might not be a foolproof method to protect its drivers, but it sends a clear signal that the TLC is willing to invest in protecting its employees, and in the relationship between the commission and its drivers. To offer its drivers (and passengers) this type of protection, Uber would have to take on more responsibility for its drivers, like classifying them as full-time employees (as opposed to contractors), something the company has been fighting to avoid. But Benjamin Sachs, Kestnbaum Professor of Labor and Industry at Harvard Law School, sees Uber’s anti-gun policy as a clear indication that the company is already behaving like a traditional employer. He sees Uber’s punitive measures as comparable to that of any employer’s: “You set the rule and you discipline people or terminate them.” The specifics of how that actually works, he contends, are a problem not contained to Uber. “In the modern economy there are lots of employers, employment-relationships where there is not very much if any direct supervision.” Michael Litrownik, an attorney in New York with the workplace advocacy firm Outten & Golden LLP, thinks that a more involved relationship between Uber and its drivers could make the policy enforceable. “Uber is in communication with passengers—if a passenger notices that there’s a gun somewhere in the car they could send an email to Uber.” Uber could take it a step further, he said, by adding a “report a weapon” button to their app. That technology could be flipped to allow drivers to do the same. Or, he suggested, the company could send inspectors into the field to spot check drivers and check in on passengers. The problem with this solution is that the more control Uber exerts over its drivers and their conduct, the stronger the case that Uber drivers should be considered employees rather than independent contractors. All said, Uber makes it very clear that it won’t be held responsible for their customer’s safety. (Uber did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.) From the service’s terms and conditions: Uber does not guarantee the quality, suitability, safety, or ability of third party providers. You agree that the entire risk arising out of your use of these services, and any service or good requested in connection therewith, remains solely with you, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. While the TLC, a government regulatory authority, does not have a comparable terms of service, it does have a Passenger’s Bill of Rights: Passengers who feel that their drivers didn’t behave appropriately are invited to contact the TLC. It’s hard to speculate how changes to Uber’s policies might have affected the terrible outcome of Sunday’s shootings in Michigan. But the company’s approach to guns is very much reflective of the current state of firearm safety legislation in this country, where we have an abundance of guns, but few laws that effectively protect people from their misuse.

Nerf, the iconic toy manufacturer known for its foam ammo and the weapons to shoot it, has just outdone itself with theÂ Nerf Rival Khaos MXVI-4000. The fully automatic blaster comes with a clip capable of holding 40 rounds of balls that can reach speeds ofÂ 68 mph, the VergeÂ reported.Â Hasbro announced the toy, Nerf's first foray into fully automatic ""weapons,"" during the 2016 Toy FairÂ in New York City. It will hit stores this fall for $69.99, according to the Verge. So what does firing a fully automatic Nerf gun look like?Â Well, admittedly, it looks kind of cool: While the Nerf ammo reportedly doesn't leave any permanent damage, the move is curious as the United States remains embroiled in a contentious debate about gun violence and gun control, and automatic and semi-automatic weapons are at the center of that debate. Many activists on the left are adamant that the proliferation of such weapons have led to a dangerous rise in mass shootings across the country. In 2015, the U.S. averagedÂ more thanÂ one mass shooting per day. In many cases, the U.S. can rack up more shooting deaths in days than other countries can in years, and even decades. Â Â At least a handful of Twitter user saw aÂ problem with the toy: But a Twitter scan suggested more users were more trigger happy than not: And, while surely innocuous, one tweet gives reason for momentary pause. Writes @whiterabbit216, ""I found a fully automatic nerf gun online that holds 40 rounds and fires them up to 68mph that I want for work in the office."" In any event, even the most stringent proposed gun controlÂ bills do not call for the control of Nerf guns. So the new blaster will probably be coming to a toy store near you.

Dalton is reportedly an Uber driver, and was opening fire randomly as he picked up fares, according to local Michigan newspaper the Battle Creek Enquirer. Hours before Dalton began his shooting rampage, a Kalamazoo woman posted on Facebook warning locals not to ride with Dalton, who had been driving ""eratically"" when her fiancee was in the car with him.

""The technology is way in front of the policymakers and the law,"" McCaul said Wednesday at an event at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Warner remarked on his fear that the relationship between the intelligence community and the tech sector had become adversarial as the two sides ""talk past each other"" when they ought to be cooperating. At the heart of the committee is the delicate balance between the needs (and wants) of investigators seeking encrypted information and the rights and privacy of the American public. ""There are tensions,"" Warner said, ""but we want to maintain American innovation, we want to maintain America's privacy rights, and we definitely want to make sure Americans are safe from acts of terror and criminal acts."" The pairing of McCaul, the chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security and a former federal prosecutor, and Warner, a former tech and telecommunications investor, is emblematic of the cooperation that the two hope to bring forth with a committee that would include representatives from Silicon Valley, the FBI, privacy advocates, encryption experts, and law-enforcement agencies. The issue of criminals using encryption to hide their tracks — an act known as going dark — has been brought into the spotlight by Apple's public battle with the FBI over creating a ""backdoor"" for investigators to access the encrypted iPhone of Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. A similar discussion arose surrounding the assertion that encryption was used in the planning of the November Paris attacks, though the extent to which encryption was actually used remains unclear. McCaul had previously promised that the commission ""will not be like other blue ribbon panels: established and forgotten"" and that it will be required to build ""a range of actionable recommendations that protect privacy and public safety."" ""I'm not a big commission guy either,"" the congressman said at Wednesday's event. ""I was skeptical myself."" But McCaul suggested a sense of duty to act: ""If Congress does nothing, as some would advocate [...] and we get hit in the United States with a Paris-style attack — I don't want that on my hands."" Despite McCaul's experience as a prosecutor and Warner's time in the tech industry, the two seemed to switch positions as they discussed their plan with the press. McCaul noted that there would be no ""knee-jerk"" legislative response to the issue of encryption that could solve the problem, while Warner seemed to express sympathy for the argument that the FBI's claim against Apple was a necessary ""one-off circumstance"" rather than a precedent for further policy. The lawmakers did not want to speculate as to what proposals the commission might make and felt that current litigation — which they suggested may have been avoided if a commission had existed earlier — should proceed through the judicial system without congressional interference. Warner also emphasized that the commission was not about encryption alone but about digital security in general, both in the present and as it may evolve in the future. McCaul and Warner hope to introduce their legislation creating the committee next week. Warner noted that he expected the bill to receive ""broad bipartisan support"" and for it to be fast-tracked into effect. ""I think this could be a case where we prove the pundits wrong and actually get something done.""",2016-02-25 07:22:00,2 congressmen want to build an army of tech experts and spies to try to catch terrorists when they 'go dark',,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

180,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/technology/apple-shareholders-show-their-support-for-tim-cook.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Katie Benner CUPERTINO, Calif. — Even before Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, began his speech on Friday at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, he got a standing ovation. As Mr. Cook, 55, stood before the auditorium on Apple’s campus, the audience — made up mostly of investors in the company — rose from their seats and applauded him. “Where we stand in times of controversy is a measure of our character,” said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, an Apple shareholder who attended the meeting. “Some leaders only follow opinion polls. Others stand up for their principles, refuse to compromise, and mold opinion. We have such a leader of Apple, Tim Cook.” The meeting was a striking scene of support for Mr. Cook, who has led Apple into a battle against the United States government. The company is opposing a federal court order requiring it to help law enforcement officials break into an iPhone used by one of the attackers in last year’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple has said that the government is overstepping its bounds and that complying with the order could set a dangerous precedent, while law enforcement officials say the order is a one-time situation. Apple is “a staunch advocate for our customers’ privacy and personal safety,” Mr. Cook said at the meeting. “We do these things because they are the right things to do. Being hard doesn’t scare us.” Technology’s largest companies are now also aligning themselves with Apple. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo have said they will file one or more briefs in California federal court next week in support of Apple. More could join. Cindy Cohn, the executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who was also at the meeting, said she applauded Apple’s leadership in fighting for the security and privacy of customers. She said the foundation would file a brief supporting Apple’s refusal to comply with the court order. During the shareholder meeting, an energized Mr. Cook, dressed in his customary blue oxford shirt and jeans, also noted that Apple had released new versions of its mobile and desktop operating systems, which have the advanced security and encryption features that have frustrated the law enforcement agents who want access to data on Apple’s devices. He said 77 percent of all active devices were using these most advanced and secure operating systems. Other social issues were also raised at the meeting. Mr. Cook said a pay study at the company had found that women earned 99.6 cents for every $1 that men did and that underrepresented minorities earned 99.7 cents for every $1 that white employees earned in similar roles.

They knew her as ""Judy."" She was quick with a wave or a hello, always up for a little chit-chat. ""A sweet, sweet old lady,"" said Daniel Arnold, Brown's next-door neighbor for the last three years. ""You couldn't ask for a better neighbor."" Arnold, like others who knew Brown, were coming to terms with the news that the 74-year-old was one of six people killed Saturday during a shooting spree that police have said was carried out by Jason B. Dalton, a 45-year-old Cooper Township man. Two other people were seriously injured during the shooting spree, police said. Brown was with two friends, 60-year-old Mary Jo Nye and 68-year-old Barbara Hawthorne, as well as a 14-year-old girl, were in a Chevolet Cruze in the parking lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant on South Ninth Street when they were shot. Nye and Hawthorne were both killed. The 14-year-old girl, who police have not identified, was critically hurt and investigators have said she is clinging to life at Bronson Methodist Hospital. Police said Dalton also shot and killed 62-year-old Mary Lou Nye, of Baroda, who was inside a Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan. The shooting at the Cracker Barrel was reported at about 10:24 p.m. Saturday and occurred about 15 minutes after Dalton is suspected of fatally shooting 17-year-old Tyler Smith and Tyler's father, Rich, while they were looking at cars in the parking lot of Seelye Kia on Stadium Drive. Police have said Dalton's rampage began at about 5:42 p.m. when he shot a woman multiple times in Richland Township. Arnold said he had been watching news coverage of the shooting rampage but was ""floored"" when he learned Sunday afternoon that one of the victims was his neighbor. He said he talked to Brown often when she was in her yard picking up sticks and cleaning up. He said she suffered from emphysema and had a few cats. He said he last saw her on Saturday about 6:30 p.m. as she was getting in a vehicle with friends. He assumes she was headed out for dinner at the Cracker Barrel restaurant. ""It kind of goes to show you none of us are safe,"" Arnold said. ""Just going out to eat for a bite with your friends you'd never expect something like that."" Jeff West, another of Brown's neighbors, expressed the same shock Sunday as he talked about Brown. He said he saw police outside Brown's house Sunday morning and learned from them that Brown had died and the officers were trying to notify her family. West said he didn't learn until later Sunday, through Facebook, that Brown was a victim of the mass shooting spree in Kalamazoo. He called the news ""sad"" and ""unreal."" He said Brown, who has lived in her home for several years, was ""super nice and friendly."" West said while learning of Brown's death Sunday, he also found out that his niece, who lives in Mattawan, was close friends with Tyler Smith. West said Tyler had been at his brother's house visiting just a few weeks ago. ""You gotta kidding me,"" West said of his reaction to the tragic news he received Sunday. ""... It was ridiculous."" Dalton is being held in the Kalamazoo County Jail and prosecutors have said he is expected to be arraigned Monday on murder charges, as well as other felonies.

213,http://mic.com/articles/135770/how-apple-s-tim-cook-rose-from-tech-ceo-to-political-powerhouse,"Apple CEO Tim Cook is only getting started in his very publicÂ battle with the FBI over user privacy.Â Cook has been at the center of one of the biggest stories in tech, thanks toÂ a court orderÂ that asked Apple to provide the FBI with tools to weaken the security lock on anÂ iPhoneÂ belonging to Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the gunmen involved inÂ a mass shootingÂ that took place inÂ San Bernardino, California, in December.Â The CEO refused.Â After releasing an openÂ letter to the FBI last week, Cook then published a customer FAQÂ Monday morning explaining Apple's position and why the FBI's request has ""important and dangerous implications"" beyond this particular case.Â ""Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation,"" Cook wrote in the open letter. ""In the wrong hands, this software â which does not exist today â would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession."" The result, according to Cook, is that this would put Apple's customers at risk. The FBI has countered that it's only asking for tools to unlock one specific iPhone, not a permanent backdoor into iPhones at large.Â In the FAQ, Cook dismisses this notion: ""The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limitedÂ to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control."" Rather than battling the government behind closed doors, Cook is using his role as the head of the most valuable company in the world to shape the outcome of a major legal, political and ethical issue. But this is not the first time the CEO has been vocal on issues within the public interest. Outspoken actor: ""I think we're seeing something kind of unique,"" Michael Cusumano, co-author ofÂ Strategy Rules: Five Timeless Lessons From Bill Gates, Andy Grove, and Steve JobsÂ and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Mic. ""When the CEO of Apple speaks, people listen. I think that it is the same for Google or Microsoft or GE. But you don't find those CEOs speaking out very much. He's got a sharper edge to him than I think we thought he had."" There's no doubt that chief executives of other major companies have the power to change policy through lobbying and forming relationships with legislators. But to curry favor with the public is an altogether different kind of powerÂ âÂ one that stands to be even greater. In March 2015, Cook wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post that drew the nation's attention to legislative measures that were being considered in 24 different states that would allow businesses to evade discrimination laws if it was a part of their religious beliefs to do so. For instance, enablingÂ a pizza shop owner to refuse to service gay weddings. The letter followedÂ a wave of criticism from other major tech companies, including Sales Force, which canceled a major event in the state. Though Cook wasn't the first to speak up on the issue, his letter did draw broad attention to the legislation, fueling a movement against these bills.Â The public pressure resulted in Indiana reforming the law so that people could not use their religious beliefs to discriminate against anyone based on their age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, color, military service, ancestry, religion, disability and national origin. Arkansas also took similar measures to amend a comparable bill before it was voted into law. While some argued that these changes did not do enough to protect potential discrimination based on religious beliefs, it shouldn't go unnoticed that Cook's letter sparked was apart of the charge that lead to actual legislative change. Â A departure from Jobs:Â OthersÂ have said it before, but Tim Cook is a decidedly different CEO from Steve Jobs, who died in 2011.Â For a long time, Cook was just one of the cogs in Apple's great machine. He joined Apple in 1998 as senior vice president of worldwide operations and rose to chief operating officer before Jobs' death. Now CEO, Cook is in an enormously influential position to speak and be heard. ""It's a bully pulpit for speaking out on issues he feels passionately about,"" Cusumano toldÂ Mic. ""Jobs never used the company as a bully pulpit.""Â Jobs preferred to make public show of Apple products, not political matters. Apple has statedÂ that Washington wasn't a priority for Jobs and precious little was spent on lobbying efforts, according to a Bloomberg article detailingÂ Cook's first dance with Congress over taxation issues. Even Jobs' use of a political science-fiction novel in its famed ""1984"" Super Bowl campaign was strategically corporate. The ad references George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984 and paints ""Big Blue,"" for IBM, as ""Big Brother"" and IBM customers as grey mindless drones following a televised leader, while portraying Apple as a beacon of creativity, color and free thought.Â While Jobs was eager to go after corporate competitors, Cook has been far more focused on tackling legislation during his tenure as CEO. He'sÂ spoken out on corporate taxation, gay rights, religious rights and digital privacy. Some of these topics are hardly germane to Apple's business. Rather, Cook hasÂ developed a reputation for speaking out on issues that are important to him personally. For instance: gay rights. In October 2014, Tim Cook announced that he was gay in an opinion piece. This was perhaps Cook's coming-out ceremony in more ways than one. It kicked off a much more public persona â and a streak of activism â for the previously quiet CEO. The opening to that hallmark letter has now become more relevant than ever. ""Throughout my professional life, I've tried to maintain a basic level of privacy,"" Cook wrote. Now that privacy that he enjoyed for much of his adult life, as he sees it, could be in jeopardy. It's also a strategic business move.Â Of course, given Cook's influence, there's a question over whether his public pleas are all part of an elaborateÂ press stuntÂ to give Apple customers the impression that the company is on their side. That could very well be â but it would be shortsighted to write off Cook's statements as nothing but PR. As Edward Snowden's revelations about bulk government data collection demonstrated, the government is prone to overstepping its bounds when given a little leeway. Instances of the government overextending its reach are ubiquitous: One example is Stingray, a tool for tracking cellphone communications once reserved for the battlefield, which has beenÂ used in secret by police departments without a warrant. In conceding to the court order and creating a tool for the government that allows it to break into an iPhoneÂ with brute-force attacks, the company would be setting precedent for this same tool to be used again. The point Tim Cook keeps underscoring is this: If the technology exists, it will be used again and potentially, down the road, misused. Not just by the U.S. government, but by other governments where Apple vends its products. Also, people forget that strong encryption and other security protocols are technology that Apple has invested in building. The government is now asking Apple to invest its own money in building technology to break an innovation it spent time and money creating. One could argue that this discourages mobile phone and computer makers from making strong security in the future. As the head of Apple, Cook likely has some insight into how this court case may affect the future of cybersecurity. Ultimately, the fight over encryption and user-data privacy is one that reaches far beyond Apple. Cook's opposition comes on the heels of the passage of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, which provides a direct channel for companies and government to share information about breaches whileÂ potentially offering a loophole for obtaining data without a warrant. Meanwhile, Microsoft too is currently in its own battle over whether law enforcement should be able to pluck information from data centers located on foreign soil.Â Regardless of who comes out on top, there's no doubt that Cook has significant sway over the issue. Though Cook has not convinced the courts that Apple is justified in refusing the order, many journalists and consumers appear persuaded. Cook's open letter and continued public debate over the FBI order has stoked support for the iPhoneÂ maker. Will that favor go far enough to stave off the courts? We'll have to wait and see.",2016-02-19 17:25:25,How Apple's Tim Cook Rose From Tech CEO to Political Powerhouse,,109076,http://mic.com/
214,http://www.cnet.com/news/uber-michigan-shooting-jason-dalton-background-check/#ftag=CADf328eec,"Jason Dalton, who's charged with killing six people, had no criminal history and a good Uber driver rating, the ride-sharing service said. There were no ""red flags."" Uber said it was ""devastated"" by the mass shooting in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Uber defended the process it uses to screen drivers saying Monday background checks couldn't have identified the risks posed by a Michigan man charged with murdering six people while reportedly picking up fares. In a conference call, Uber Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan said Jason Dalton, who reportedly confessed to a Saturday shooting spree in Kalamazoo, Michigan, had no criminal record. Dalton's background check prompted ""no red flags,"" he said. ""No background check process would have flagged and anticipated this situation,"" Sullivan said. The shooting spree raises new concerns about the safety of Uber and its drivers, who have been accused of attacking passengers in the past. An Uber driver in Houston allegedly took a drunk female passenger to his home and raped her last April. Meanwhile, California  prosecutors filed charges that Uber's background checks failed to weed out 25 drivers with criminal records, including convictions for murder, assault, sex offenses and child abuse. Uber runs the names of potential drivers through seven years of county and federal courthouse records, a multi-state criminal database, national sex offender registry, Social Security trace and motor vehicle records. Uber rejects anyone with a history of violent crimes, sexual offenses, gun-related violations or resisting arrest. Sullivan suggested Uber was unlikely to introduce fingerprint identification as part of the process, something the company has been criticized for excluding. ""I disagree with the assertion that fingerprints are better than the process we have in place,"" said Sullivan. Dalton, who had given more than 100 rides since starting with Uber at the end of January, had a rating of 4.73 and had received generally positive feedback from passengers. The highest rating a driver can earn is 5. However, Uber received worrying feedback about Dalton on Saturday from several riders, including one passenger who complained of erratic driving. Sullivan said Uber is cooperating with police and has GPS tools that might help the investigation. Uber has a dedicated law enforcement team in place that was able to respond immediately, he said. Uber deferred to police on releasing details of the shooting. Dalton allegedly started a shooting rampage just before 6 p.m. local time Saturday, according to CBS News. Michigan state police said he shot one woman multiple time in a townhouse parking lot, but she survived. Several hours later, Dalton allegedly shot and killed a father and son at a car dealership. Less than 20 minutes later, he allegedly shot five people in a Cracker Barrel parking lot, killing four women and critically injuring a 14-year-old girl.

215,http://www.salon.com/2016/02/26/donald_trump_is_basically_invincible_at_this_point_cruz_rubio_waited_way_too_long_to_fight_back/,"During last night's GOP debate, Marco Rubio mocked Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz attacked the billionaire for abandoning conservative orthodoxy. A whole lot of dirty laundry was aired about his business practices. There was much discussion of his tax returns and Trump said he was being audited so he couldn't release them. Rubio smugly accused Trump of repeating himself when he insisted that ""getting rid of the lines"" was his health care plan, and then hit him with the observation that the Israel/Palestine conflict isn't a real-estate deal. (The Israel/Palestine conflict actually is a kind of real estate deal, but that's beside the point.) Rubio and Cruz finally focused on the man they actually need to beat in order to win the election. If they had done it three months ago, it might have made a difference. Here's an excerpt that gives the flavor of it: BLITZER: Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has a right to respond. TRUMP: Well, look, my response is very simple. There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have. Nobody. You might say, you might talk, you're politicians, all talk, no action. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: I've been watching it all my life. You are all talk and no action. CRUZ: Then name one specific thing you've done. TRUMP: What I've seen up here -- I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar. You have a combination... RUBIO: This guy always goes for... TRUMP: You have a combination of factors. He can't do it... RUBIO: This is so typical. TRUMP: ... for the obvious reason, and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth. Other than that, I rest my case. (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: One at a time, gentlemen. Governor Kasich, you have the floor. Governor... (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: You will have a response. But I promised Governor Kasich he could respond. CARSON: Can somebody attack me, please? The post-debate analysts all said that Trump was exposed as a lightweight on policy questions, as if that's news. Of course he sounded like a fool talking about health care and foreign policy. But he's never sounded even slightly competent in these debates and it hasn't exactly hurt him. Policy is not his thing, dominance and attitude are and when he said ""this guy's a choke artist and this guy's a liar"" about the two men standing on either side of him he might as well have pounded his chest and let out a roar. And you have to give the guy  credit for chutzpah, saying after the debate that he might be being audited by the IRS because he's such a ""strong Christian"" and pretending to be offended by vulgar language used by former Mexican President Vicente Fox when he complained about Trump's plan for a wall earlier in the day. He has no shame. And that's what his fans love about him. Despite Rubio's belated feistiness and Cruz's focused aggression, they weren't able to rattle Trump enough to make him do something that would change the dynamic, and there's not much time left to do it. If they have any hope at all of stopping his momentum they will have to carry on a sustained attack after tonight, with new information rolling out to feed the press regularly along with some very effective advertising. It's hard to imagine them being able to do that in a coherent fashion before it's too late. After the debate, the pundits all rolled out the scenarios in which Rubio might still win, but it certainly seems as though it still depends on Trump collapsing, and depending on that thus far has proved to be a big mistake. But the pundits carry on nonetheless, going on about how Rubio has to win Florida and then something will happen and he'll start winning. Likewise Cruz must win Texas (which seems more likely than Rubio winning Florida, according to the latest polls) and then ... the same thing. Something happens. These media observers even talk as if Kasich could break out if he can just win his own state of Ohio, but nobody seems convinced there's actually a way to make that happen. Basically, they're right back where they started, waiting for that inevitable moment when the narcissistic cartoon billionaire finally says or does something that will destroy his campaign. Good luck with that. Perhaps the only thing truly surprising about the debate was the fact that the moderators asked the same stale questions that have been asked a dozen times before. Obamacare, Immigration, ISIS, Israel, North Korea. The only thing new was a question about the  Supreme Court vacancy in the wake of Justice Scalia's passing, and nobody bothered to ask them what they thought about the Senate Republicans refusing to consider any Obama nominee. Once again, not one question about climate change, the greatest challenge we face as a planet. Just once it would be nice to hear these Republicans say out loud why they don't consider this something the richest, most powerful nation on earth needs to deal with. Just for the record if nothing else. And even though yet another tragic mass shooting was unfolding even as the debate was taking place, the second time in a week, there was not one question about the carnage taking place in America's cities and towns. Yes, it's almost guaranteed they would all just say the problem is that more people aren't armed, but they should have to answer for this sophistry at times like this, for the sake of the victims of these tragedies if nothing else. It feels as if there have been 109 debates instead of nine, and the fact that they have finally ""winnowed"" the field has not improved them. This primary is turning into the political equivalent of the Bataan death march. And it looks as though it's not ending any time soon even, though Donald Trump now seems like the inevitable winner. The GOP presidential clown car has finally achieved something truly unexpected: It's gotten boring. Heather Digby Parton, also known as ""Digby,"" is a contributing writer to Salon.

He's participating in an interfaith dialogue that aims to address the biggest issues involving Islam on Feb. 8, 2015. (AP Photo/Willis Glassgow) CHERRY HILL -- The words were starting to get to Jeffrey Nash. In the wake of nationwide conversations surrounding Muslims in local communities, the heated rhetoric reached a point where the Camden County freeholder had to do something. So Nash stepped up to not only pass a county resolution condemning such language in solidarity with Muslim residents, he spurred the county to join in an upcoming interfaith dialogue that aims to address the root of the issue head on. ""It's important the Muslim community knows that their leadership stands behind them, that it's important to them, and it tells the community that this type of language is unacceptable, and here's why,"" said Nash. He'll join the conversation on Feb. 8 at 7 p.m., when the Katz Jewish Community Center in Cherry Hill will host Imam Morshad Saami Hossain of the Voorhees Islamic Center and Jewish Community Relations Council Executive Director David Snyder in a public forum entitled ""Extremism, Radicalization and Islam: Why are there so many acts of violence in the name of Islam?"" that Snyder said will be ""no holds barred."" ""It is an open conversation. The emphasis and the focus is on providing the opportunity to the community to ask what is on their minds, to inquire about the things they are confused about,"" said Snyder, adding these kinds of honest, interfaith conversations aren't common. ""There are a lot of Islamic leaders who will talk about Islam 101, but very few, from what we can tell, have actually tackled the issues of radicalization within their faith and address things at issue head on,"" he said. While radicalization concerns are far from new, the interfaith forum comes at a time when the influx of Syrian war refugees worldwide, the mass shooting in San Bernadino and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's controversial remarks about Muslim immigrants have sparked endless news coverage and debate over the true nature of Islam. ""It's a great opportunity in this moment. It's perfect for the time considering the climate of the political campaign,"" said Hossain, the Imam for the Voorhees Islamic Center. He said he knows there is support and understanding out in the community -- ""With every statement of bigotry that Trump says, we get a phone call saying 'We're your non-Muslim neighbors and we support you,"" said Hossain -- but to spread a true understanding, people from different faiths need to start talking openly and honestly about their divides. He wants to show people that radicalization isn't unique to Islam, and that there are far more similarities between Islam, Christianity and Judaism than there are differences. ""Our main objective now is to build that bridge between the two communities and really give them that sense of trust, that your Muslim neighbors are just as integral to the American fabric of society as anyone else and all of us want the same thing,"" said Hossain. ""We all fear terrorism, none of us want it and we have to work together in order to stop it.""

217,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/7G1PcnMAj7Y/,"About a month ago, Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine sent Bill O’Reilly a tweet encouraging him to listen to the band’s latest album, Dystopia, which had just dropped at the end of January. In said tweet, he included a photo of several of O’Reilly’s books, saying that since he had absorbed O’Reilly’s work, perhaps he should reciprocate: @oreillyfactor bill, dave here. I bought all of your books. How about you get my new album #Dystopia by @Megadeth? pic.twitter.com/BdBUPEIY7p — Dave Mustaine (@DaveMustaine) January 27, 2016  Okay, a few things here. First off, that’s not all of O’Reilly’s books; I don’t see Those Who Trespass or Culture Warrior anywhere, not to mention the immortal O’Reilly Factor For Kids. Secondly, begging Bill O’Reilly to listen to your album has to be the least metal thing of all-time. Congratulations, Vince Neil doing the chicken dance, you’re off the hook. Of course, Mustaine’s love for O’Reilly shouldn’t be too shocking; he’s been a well-known far-right conservative for quite some time. In 2012, he endorsed Rick Santorum for President, he’s stated his opposition to same-sex marriage, and in one truly cringe-inducing rant, seemed to suggest that the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo. was a hoax done to artificially increase support for gun control legislation. In short, we’ve been through this before. But if you’re a Megadeth fan, it all can be a bit much to take in because, well, it wasn’t always like this. Megadeth’s work has always had political overtones, and while I don’t know if it would be quite accurate to refer to their early work as “liberal,” you certainly wouldn’t call it conservative either. Consider 1990’s Rust In Peace, often considered to be the band’s masterpiece. Throughout this album, there are anti-war themes that would make the Fox News crowd cringe. “Rust In Peace…Polaris” is a rant against the proliferation of nuclear arms, “Holy Wars….The Punishment Due” admonishes killing in the name of religion, while “Hangar 18” features the immortal line “military intelligence/two words combined that can’t make sense,” which wouldn’t exactly sit well with the “support our troops” crowd. And it’s not like that album was a fluke. The immortal “Peace Sells” from the album of the same name was a rant against every element of society that that irritates Mustaine in which he posits himself as both an outsider and an everyman (“what do you mean I don’t support your system?/I go to court when I have to”), while the title track of 1992’s Countdown to Extinction was a treatise against the act of canned hunting. The ladder is certainly a far cry from the virulently pro-gun stance Mustaine takes now. Not because one couldn’t oppose canned hunting while supporting gun rights — many do — but because Mustaine has so thoroughly moved to the other side of the debate table. There’s just nothing about Megadeth’s early classics that would give you the impression of “wow, I bet this guy is a pretty staunch Conservative!” Although, if we’re being fair, notes of right-wing politics did permeate Mustaine’s views even in Megadeth’s early years. In a 1988 interview, Mustaine criticized homosexuality, saying the Bible was against it, and in another interview the same year, he stated his proto-Trump plan to “build a giant wall” along the Mexican border. So, despite the anti-war themes of some classic Megadeth songs, he was never exactly a dyed-in-the-wool leftist. That said, he’s definitely shifted further to the right in the past decade or so. What caused this transition? A likely answer would be Mustaine’s conversion as a Born Again Christian. While attending AA meetings, Mustaine decided to make his faith more of a focal point of his life. This would lead to the controversial decision to no longer tour with any bands that featured references to Satanism in their imagery or lyrics, a move that likely alienated him the metal community. It can’t help but seem like once Mustaine began further embracing his Christianity, the right-wing views that had previously been a footnote in his career were now pushed to the forefront. This isn’t the only reason, however, as Mustaine also became a fan of radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. While promoting 2009’s Endgame, Mustaine stated that he wrote the album to educate fans about concepts like the alleged New World Order. It’s not a huge stretch to think that the influence of Jones is why Mustaine now believes that the government staged a mass shooting in an attempt to take our guns. While he was never exactly trusting of the government, his embracing of far-right conspiracies is definitely a recent development. Interestingly, Mustaine’s new views haven’t really affected his approach to writing lyrics. After all, the theme of many Megadeth songs was “the world is broken, and only President Mustaine can fix it.” That’s basically still true, it’s just that now, President Mustaine has taken a severe shift to the right. Tracks on the band’s latest album, Dystopia, have titles like “The Threat Is Real,” and “Post-American World,” both of which could have been the names of ’80s Megadeth tracks, but now, Mustaine’s paranoia comes with an undeniable tinge of xenophobia; “The Threat Is Real” is almost certainly referring to concerns over Muslim immigrants entering the country. For left-wing admirers of Mustaine’s music — like myself — this all can be extremely frustrating; both the fact that Mustaine always had some problematic viewpoints, and that they’ve gotten far worse over the past decade or so. In his review of Dystopia for The A.V. Club, J.J. Anselni discusses the disconnect between the album’s brilliant musicianship, and Mustaine’s “offensive lyrics.” He gave the album a D, so you can guess which element he ultimately decided mattered more. It’s an understandable frustration. In spire of his views, Mustaine is still making incredible music and Megadeth’s latest is a modern-day monument to his chops. Unfortunately, if you want to be able to appreciate it, unless your in line with is fairly extreme views, you may have to hold your nose and turn your head to a lot of the things he’s saying. And personally, for this longtime Megadeth fan, that may be too much to ask. ",2016-02-27 17:00:44,On The Ever-Shifting Politics Of Dave Mustaine,,68816,http://www.uproxx.com/#spider
218,http://newsone.com/3363866/indiana-police-investigating-mysterious-execution-style-shooting-of-three-sudanese-immigrants/,"Posted February 29, 2016 The deaths of three young men from a predominantly Muslim community in Indiana have raised more questions than answers for investigators. The Washington Post reports that 23-year-old Mohamedtaha Omar, 20-year-old Adam Mekki, and 17-year-old Muhannad Tairab were found dead Wednesday (Feb. 24) at a home police called a “party house” in Fort Wayne. The men were all shot “execution-style,” according to law enforcement. Speaking with local news site WANE-TV, Police Chief Garry Hamilton believes more than one person may be behind the deaths. “With that many people involved, victims, it’s hard for one person to commit that act by themselves so there had to be some other people present,” the police chief said. “These young people were just starting out their lives, and now, they’ve lost their lives. I need the citizens of Fort Wayne to support us to give us this information and anyone with information about this to help solve this case.” The home was a designated area for gatherings involving teens and young adults of African descent. Fort Wayne police said the house was monitored by the gang and violent crimes unit, but the victims had no gang ties. Darfur People’s Association founder and vice president Motasim Adam, who visited the families of the victims, refuted media claims made about their religious backgrounds. Omar and Tairab were Muslim and Mekki was Christian, he said. All three hailed from the Sahel region in Africa. Rusty York, the city’s public safety director, told WPTA-TV that investigators do not think the killing was motivated by the victims’ religious affiliation, the Washington Post reports. The homicide occurred the same week as the mass shooting in Kalamazoo, Michigan and the Kansas workplace shooting, prompting people to take to social media regarding the minimal coverage of the crime with the hashtag, #OurThreeBoys. The FBI has announced their assistance in the investigation. Muslim leaders in the community said the case has a stark comparison to the 2015 shooting of three Muslims in Chapel Hill, N.C. Via The Washington Post: Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Washington-based Muslim advocacy group, said it has reached out to investigators in the case, to local Muslim community leaders and to the families of the victims. “People think back to the Chapel Hill murders where the family and Muslim community firmly believes it is a bias motive,” Hooper said. “They look at this and see a similar kind of thing so that’s in everyone’s mind. It brings back those memories and concerns.” On Saturday, Omar and Tairab were laid to rest at the Islamic Center of Fort Wayne. Another remembrance honoring the victims will take place this evening at 7 p.m. Check out the livestream here.

        Nathan McDermott Posted on February 16, 2016, at 4:01 p.m. ET Speaking at a campaign event in Greenville, South Carolina on Tuesday, Bill Clinton incorrectly said the married couple who perpetrated a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, had never been to the Middle East. One of the shooters was raised in the region; the other had made several trips. The former president was discussing the need to have a robust defense policy without undermining America’s core values when he made the comments. “We got to have a strong defense, we got to have tough diplomacy. Also, in a world where the borders look more like nets than walls,"" Clinton said. ""Keep in mind, the people that perpetrated that travesty in San Bernardino had never been to the Middle East. They were converted over the social media."" Tashfeen Malik was born in Pakistan and lived in Saudi Arabia for most of her life. Syed Rizwan Farook, Malik’s American-born husband, had also been to Saudi Arabia multiple times, including for several weeks in 2013 as part of the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that Muslims are required to take at least once in their lifetime. Farook traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2014 and returned with Malik after they had met online. Soon after, they married in California. Although Malik expressed her allegiance to jihadist groups through social media, there has been no evidence to formally link the shooters, or their plot, to any larger terrorist organization, and officials have said the couple may have been self-radicalized.

221,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/obama-calls-religious-tolerance,"President Barack Obama said Wednesday he wanted to assure Muslim-Americans that they were an important part of the country’s successes despite the rhetoric coming from some Republican presidential candidates. Obama delivered his comments in Maryland after meeting with Muslim leaders at the Islamic Society of Baltimore. It marked his first visit to an American mosque as commander-in-chief. He said that he had two words for Muslim-Americans that he said they don’t get to hear often enough: “Thank you,” both for keeping the country together and serving their neighbors. He noted that this is “a time of concern” and “of some fear” for Muslim communities across the United States, attributing some of it to the “inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans that has no place in our country.” “We’re one American family and when any part of our family starts to feel separate or second class or targeted it tears at the very fabric of our nation,” he said. Obama confronted the anti-Muslim rhetoric espoused by some of the Republican presidential candidates before. Obama condemned such comments at his final State of the Union speech as “just wrong.” He also addressed attitudes toward American Muslims after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, saying that the Muslim community should be embraced and that “freedom is more powerful than fear.” Obama said Wednesday that Muslims were part of the wave of immigrants that helped improve the country in its early years and have gone on to become architects, scientists, and service members. He noted that there were those who have conflated acts of terrorism with the beliefs of the Muslim faith, but addressed the issue as it related to the community. “Even as the overwhelming majority — and I repeat the overwhelming majority — of the world’s Muslims embrace Islam as a source of peace, it is undeniable that a small fraction of Muslims propagate a perverted version of Islam,” Obama said. “This is the truth.” Obama said people of all faiths have a responsibility to defend each other’s religious freedom. “We have to understand an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths and when any religious group is targeted we all have a responsibility to speak up and we have to reject politics that seeks to manipulate prejudice or bias and targets people because of religion,” Obama said. He said that “none” of us can be silent and be “bystanders to bigotry.” “Together we’ve got to show that America truly protects all faiths,” he said. “I will do everything I can to lift up the multiplicity of Muslim voices that promote pluralism and peace.” Planned Parenthood is leaving the federal government’s Title X program, which funds family planning services for low-income people, due to… Following the ousters of the Homeland Security secretary and Secret Service director, and the withdrawal of the would-be ICE director’s… Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Monday called for ousted Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles to testify before… Non-members are still able to read comments, but will no longer be able to participate.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. WASHINGTON – A U.S. magistrate judge has ordered Apple to help the FBI break into a work-issued iPhone used by a gunman in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. Apple CEO Tim Cook immediately objected, setting the stage for a high-stakes legal fight between Silicon Valley and the federal government. Here's a look at the case so far: ___ WHAT DID THE JUDGE DECIDE? Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym, a former federal prosecutor, ordered Apple Inc. to help the FBI hack into an encrypted iPhone used by Syed Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in December in the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. The phone was provided to him by San Bernardino County, where he worked as a government health inspector. Prosecutors say they don't know whether anything relevant is on the phone but can't access the information because they don't know the password and Apple won't cooperate. ___ WHAT MAKES THIS RULING SO IMPORTANT? Federal law enforcement and leading technology companies have long been at an impasse about how to balance digital privacy for consumers against the responsibility of federal agents and police to investigate crimes or terrorism. The Obama administration has acknowledged encryption as valuable for privacy protection but, until now, had struggled to identify a major case that shows how Apple's encryption can hobble their investigations. ___ HOW'S APPLE SUPPOSED TO HELP? The judge's order forces Apple to create and supply highly specialized software that the FBI can load onto the iPhone. That software would bypass a self-destruct feature that erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to guess the passcode. The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one. ___ WHAT IMPACT WILL THIS HAVE ON OTHER APPLE USERS? The Justice Department said it's asking Apple only to help unlock the iPhone used by Farook. The judge said the software should include a ""unique identifier"" so that it can't be used to unlock other iPhones. But it's unclear how readily the software could be adapted to work against other phones. And the FBI would likely share its new tool with U.S. intelligence agencies — and possibly foreign allies — that are investigating global terrorism. Cook warned, ""Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks — from restaurants and banks to stores and homes."" ___ WHY DO THE FEDS WANT INFORMATION OFF THE PHONE? Prosecutors say they think the device could hold clues about who the couple communicated with while planning the shootings and about where they traveled before and after the attack. Investigators are still working to piece together what happened during 18 minutes on Dec. 2, between the time of the attacks and the moment they were killed in a police shootout. ___ WHAT DID APPLE SAY? The government asked the judge to rule in its favor in a 40-page court filing submitted without Apple's participation. After Pym's order, in a strongly worded message to its customers early Wednesday, Cook warned that the judge's order would set a ""dangerous precedent."" He said the company was being asked to take an ""unprecedented step"" that would threaten the security of Apple's customers. The company defended its use of encryption as the only way to keep its customers' personal data — their music, private conversations and photos — from being hacked. The statement foreshadows a fierce legal fight. ___ HOW IS THIS LEGAL? Pym relied on the 1789 All Writs Act, which has been used many times in the past by the government to require a third party to aid law enforcement in its investigation. Apple's CEO said the government was trying to dangerously expand what the law requires a third party to do. He said the government could require Apple to build surveillance software or more to help law enforcement. In a months-long federal case in New York, another federal judge has delayed ruling on whether the law can compel Apple to help the government break the security on its devices. That case remains pending. ___ Follow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/latams and Eric Tucker at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

226,http://nypost.com/2016/02/04/vagrant-teen-brothers-charged-in-deadly-homeless-camp-shooting/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Associated Press Submit February 4, 2016 | 8:10pm SEATTLE — It was their mom’s birthday, and the three vagrant teenage brothers were intent on collecting a $500 drug debt she was owed, an informant would later tell police. So, prosecutors say, they marched up a hill into a wooded homeless encampment called “The Jungle” and started shooting. Among the victims were two women who screamed or begged for their lives, witnesses said. Among those left unharmed was a man by a campfire who told the boys he was just trying to warm his feet. The brothers — 13, 16 and 17 — were charged Thursday with first-degree murder and assault in the attack, which left two people dead and three wounded. The oldest two will face those charges in adult court. Their arrests on Monday came almost a week after the Jan. 26 shooting, which authorities and court documents suggest was the latest chapter in their troubled young lives. It wasn’t immediately clear how recently they’d been in school. Their parents have had a turbulent relationship full of jail stints, drug use and restraining orders. Their dad, described by police as a drug dealer and gang member, has been in prison since last spring, and they’d been living with their mom in tents by Safeco Field, where the Mariners play. When they went to collect the debt, they were already being investigated for possible connections to robberies and another fatal shooting in October, police say. “They were wards of the state, but they had run from every placement DSHS had arranged for them,” King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg said, referring to the Department of Social and Health Services. The Associated Press is not naming the brothers because they are juveniles. Their lawyers did not immediately return calls seeking comment. The Jungle sits beneath Interstate 5 and has been a crime problem for decades — an area where marginalized people are victimized by drugs, robberies, assaults and worse. It’s an area that “lives up to its name,” Satterberg said. Despite their ages, the brothers seemed to move among its lawless environs with ease, learning they could take what they wanted by force, the prosecutor said. When they went to find Phat T. Nguyen last week, they were armed with a .22-caliber handgun that one informant said belonged to their mother and a .45-caliber pistol that was reported stolen in a burglary in 1976, Satterberg said. Nguyen was wounded in the shooting. The two people killed were Jeannine L. Zapata, 45, and James Q. Tran, 33. The bloodshed further riveted the city’s attention on its growing homelessness problem. Mayor Ed Murray and King County Executive Dow Constantine declared states of emergencies in the fall, directing more than $9 million in new spending. The number of people living on streets or in cars in King County has jumped to more than 4,500 — a 19 percent increase from last year, according to a one-night annual survey conducted on Jan. 29. Statewide, schools officials say the number of homeless pupils in the 2014-15 school year was 35,511, up 9 percent from the previous year. To ease the problem, officials have authorized three city-sanctioned “tent cities” to provide a safer place for those without shelter. In the coming weeks, Seattle is also opening two parking lots in neighborhoods so people living in RVs and vehicles can safely park. The “safe lots” will hold about 50 vehicles and have sanitation and garbage service, as well as social services. Some residents have criticized the actions, saying they provide no permanent solutions. Others have complained of increased human waste, trash and criminal activity. On Thursday, Satterberg joined the chorus of people calling for The Jungle to be cleared out. “Hundreds of thousands of people drive by The Jungle every day on I-5,” he said. “And these citizens are unaware of the struggles that take place there among marginalized people who are homeless, mentally ill, drug addicted and/or criminally oriented.” Police were investigating whether the mother of the teens charged with murder should face charges herself. It was unclear how to contact her, and relatives did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The mother has previously been the subject of restraining orders sought by the boys’ father and his girlfriend, who accused the mom of assaulting her. The mother also sought a restraining order against the father in 2003, accusing him of threats and violence. The father has done time on drug and gun charges. He took court-ordered domestic violence classes within the past decade. The mother’s offenses have included identity theft and shoplifting from a Goodwill store. She completed drug court requirements in 2008, following an arrest four years earlier for dealing cocaine in a downtown Seattle park. Authorities said they aren’t sure the youngest boy was ever actually armed during the shooting. Questioned by police, he said he didn’t want to get his brothers in trouble. The boy “was asked if he could go back in time what would he do differently,” a detective wrote, “and he stated he would never have gone up the hill that night.” Read Next Ancient wildebeest cousin had a strange dinosaur-like trai...

Contributing Editor Hillary Clinton is taking a message to South Carolina: Bernie Sanders is soft on guns. In a newly released campaign ad, Clinton is hitting the Vermont senator straight in his progressive bona fides. The 30-second spot features Rev. Anthony Thompson, who lost his wife in the Charleston church massacre last year. In debates and town halls, Clinton has repeatedly pointed out that Sanders—in addition to voting against the Brady Bill—has failed to support the most basic tenet of gun control: background checks. And being in favor of civil immunity for gun manufacturers likely played well in the Green Mountain State, where gun violence is relatively uncommon. “I come from a state that has virtually no gun control,” Sanders said at a gala dinner hosted by the South Carolina Democratic Party over the King holiday weekend. “We must bring this country together under those provisions that the majority of the country supports.” However, a public opinion poll conducted by CBS News and The New York Times found that the vast majority of Americans—92 percent— “favor background checks for all gun buyers.” South Carolinians have been grappling with gun control since the day 21-year-old Dylann Roof murdered nine people—including South Carolina State Sen. Clementa C. Pinckney —after a prayer service.  The mass shooting at Emanuel A.M.E. Church, one of the largest and oldest historically black churches in the South, whipped up the political winds. State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, who endorsed Clinton this week, introduced a comprehensive bill aimed at curtailing the flow of illegally obtained guns and tightening restrictions on buyers. Senator Sanders, who talked to the state lawmaker about his legislation, has said he voted against the Brady Bill because he “opposed a provision in the bill that would have held gun shop owners responsible if a gun they sold was used in a terrible crime.” He favors, according to a statement provided to The Daily Beast, holding “manufacturers and sellers responsible for knowingly or negligently selling a gun to the wrong person.” None of that has stopped the Clinton campaign from attempting to exploit what they see as a weakness. By targeting Sanders with an ad that features an “Emanuel 9” widow, just 15 days before the Democratic primary contest in South Carolina, Clinton is out to show that Sanders is out of the mainstream and that he doesn’t understand the needs of people who live in the line of fire. That message is being dispatched by surrogates—including state elected officials and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, to houses of worship in every corner of the state. In debates, Sanders has vigorously defended himself on the issue—pointing to his D-minus rating from the National Rifle Association and saying he will continue to fight for “common sense gun safety measures” as president. The Sanders campaign said the senator does support closing the gun-show loophole, which allows unlicensed dealers to sell weapons without a background check. He also wants to make “straw man” purchases a federal crime, ban semi-automatic assault weapons, and launch a renewed focus on mental health. While gun control is not a featured issued on the Sanders campaign website, FeelTheBern.org says the candidate believes in a “middle ground solution.” “Bernie believes that gun control is largely a state issue because attitudes and actions with regards to firearms differ greatly between rural and urban communities.” The website is built and maintained by volunteers who have no official affiliation with Sanders. By comparison, Clinton’s proposals are much more aggressive and she lays out her public record on the issue—as first lady when she supported the Brady Bill and background checks, and as a U.S. senator when she co-sponsored legislation to reinstate the assault weapons ban. Clinton has vowed to close the “Charleston loophole,” which allows a gun sale to proceed without a background check if that check has not been completed within three days. There are few who believe that Sanders stands a real chance of winning in states like South Carolina—with its markedly more diverse electorate. Clinton, with the new ad and a throng of issue-driven surrogates, is out to prove that Sanders is disconnected, that he doesn’t know how “real” Americans live, and that he doesn’t know how to govern. Clinton isn’t just saying that Sanders is soft on guns, but that his all-or-nothing positions are dangerous.",2016-02-12 16:05:00,Can South Carolina Forgive Bernieâs Gun Record?,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

          / CBS News Bill Gates has weighed in on the white hot dispute between Apple and the Justice Department over whether Apple should comply with a federal magistrate's order to help government investigators hack into an iPhone that belonged to one of the San Bernardino shooters. And the Microsoft founder took a decidedly different stand than most other Silicon Valley executives have. Apple CEO Tim Cook is vigorously fighting the order, which added to the ongoing national debate over personal user privacy versus ensuring national security. Apple says complying with the order would establish the possibility of a ""backdoor"" that could be used by third parties to access an unlimited number of devices in the future. The FBI asserts this is less an issue of securing private data on a phone and more one of making sure all crucial intelligence on the mass shooting is collected. The December 2 massacre left 14 people dead and 22 others wounded. In an interview with the Financial Times, Gates took the position of the government, denying the case would set a precedent. ""This is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information. They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case,"" the newspaper quotes Gates as saying. ""It is no different than [the question of] should anybody ever have been able to tell the phone company to get information, should anybody be able to get at bank records,"" Gates continued. ""Let's say the bank had tied a ribbon round the disk drive and said 'don't make me cut this ribbon because you'll make me cut it many times.""' Gates also told the Financial Times that, as the newspaper put it, there are ""benefits to the government being able to enforce taxation, stop crime and investigate terror threats, but said there must be rules on when the information can be accessed."" He told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Charlie Rose on Rose's show on PBS he  thinks Apple is only ""forcing a complete judicial process"" -- perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court -- and he doesn't think Apple is saying it would defy the government in the end. ""I think they're saying, 'Hey, as a society, we think this discussion of safeguards is important.' I don't disagree with that,"" he remarked to Rose. Gates spoke to the Financial Times at the launch of the annual letter from his charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In a letter to Apple customers posted on the company's website last week, Cook said, ""Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government."" But FBI Director James Comey insists the case is ""quite narrow,"" writing in a blog post Sunday night that, ""We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land.""

232,http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/20/us/politics/us-immigration-policy-screening.html?_r=2&referer=,"Advertisement Supported by By Ron Nixon WASHINGTON — The arrest of a California man on charges that he traveled to Syria to fight with terrorist groups, then lied about it to the Department of Homeland Security, offers new ammunition for both sides in the fierce debate over the refugee policy of the Obama administration. Conservatives and some federal law enforcement officials say the case of the Californian, Aws Mohammed Younis al-Jayab, 23, shows that the refugee program leaves the nation vulnerable to terrorism. But Homeland Security officials and Democrats in Congress contend that his arrest demonstrates that the system works. The ambiguities of Mr. Jayab’s arrest last month are at the core of a dispute over whether the United States should tightly restrict immigration from countries associated with terrorism, or should join some European nations in accepting rigorously screened applicants in order to help stem the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Last year’s terrorist attacks in Paris and the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., have prompted a broader examination of America’s immigration policy because some officials fear that terrorists could exploit the ways people enter the country. Before his arrest, Mr. Jayab seemed like a typical young adult: He liked sports cars, studied computer programming at a community college in Sacramento and worked nights as a security guard. But the federal authorities have charged that Mr. Jayab, who was born in Iraq and came to the United States as a refugee from Syria, traveled to that war-torn country from late 2013 to early 2014 to fight on the side of terrorist groups and then lied about it to the authorities. He faces up to eight years in prison if convicted. “Jihadists see these programs as a back door into America and will continue to exploit them until we take action,” said Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, during a hearing this month on refugee and visa programs. But supporters of the administration’s program, like Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware and ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said the arrest of Mr. Jayab and other refugees shows that the system succeeded in blunting a threat. He added that the long screening process for Syrian refugees makes it unlikely that terrorists would try to come to the United States as refugees. “Terrorists would be crazy to wait 18 to 24 months while undergoing a rigorous screening process to get into the country,” Mr. Carper said in an interview. Still, some members of Congress and security experts say the arrest of Mr. Jayab has forced them to question the screening process. Federal court documents show that at least 14 people who came to the United States as refugees have been arrested on terrorism charges in the last two years, including Mr. Jayab. “I thought that it was very secure until I saw the arrest in California and Texas,” said John J. Farmer Jr., former senior counsel to the federal commission that investigated the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, who is now a professor at Rutgers. “Now, I have my concerns.” The federal authorities charged that Mr. Jayab conspired with Omar Faraj Saeed Al Hardan, 24, an Iraqi-born refugee living in Houston, to get weapons training and eventually sneak into Syria to fight alongside terrorist groups. Benjamin Galloway, a federal public defender in Sacramento and Mr. Jayab’s lawyer, said his client had done nothing wrong. “There is no threat that this man poses and no indication that he’s engaged in any activity since his return two years ago,” he said. Many of the Paris attackers were European citizens and could have entered the United States under the visa waiver program. Tashfeen Malik, one of the attackers in San Bernardino, was granted entry to the United States on a K-1 visa, which can be given to the fiancé or fiancée of an American citizen. And a number of refugees from Bosnia, Iraq and Somalia have been arrested and charged with supporting terrorists. Homeland Security officials say the refugee screening process has a much lower security risk. Refugees recommended for resettlement in the United States first undergo screening abroad, by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In addition to intensive interviews, the agency collects biometric data such as iris scans and photographs. In the United States, refugees face another round of intense screenings and interviews by caseworkers at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington. Their names are run through law enforcement and intelligence databases at the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I., the Defense Department, the State Department and United States Customs and Border Protection, among other agencies. The Citizenship and Immigration Services agency declined to answer questions about refugees who have been arrested on charges of terrorism, citing privacy. Mr. Jayab, who came to the United States from Syria as a refugee in October 2012 and who lived for a time in Tucson and Milwaukee, seemed more interested in fast cars than in violent extremism. Court records show that on Nov. 9, 2013, he flew to Turkey from Chicago and then traveled to Syria. He told officials that he had gone to Turkey to visit his grandmother. But between November 2013 and January 2014, federal officials say, Mr. Jayab sent private, direct messages on social media saying that he was in Syria fighting with various terrorist organizations, including Ansar al-Islam, which has been on the United States’ list of foreign terrorist organizations since 2004. Mr. Jayab returned to the United States on Jan. 23, 2014, and settled in Sacramento, where he attended American River College and had a job as a security guard, according to his lawyer. In interviews with immigration officials and with the F.B.I., Mr. Jayab denied that he had gone to Syria. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said cases like Mr. Jayab’s caused him to worry about the refugee program. “What happens when nothing shows up in the databases?” he said in an interview. Senior law enforcement officials and counterterrorism experts have expressed similar unease. James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, told a congressional committee in October that the federal government could not conduct effective security checks on Syrian citizens. “We can query our database until the cows come home, but nothing will show up because we have no record of them,” he said. Homeland Security officials acknowledged that it was possible for people to get through the screening process, but they added that their biggest worry was the radicalization of immigrants after their arrival in the United States. “I can tell you who a person is today,” said a senior intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the screening program publicly. “But I can’t tell you who they will become tomorrow.” Advertisement",2016-02-20 07:00:00,Arrest of Refugee Fuels U.S. Debate on Immigration Policy - NYTimes.com,,1,http://nytimes.com

236,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/motherjones/main/~3/NGoOy-ew3H4/sundance-films-nra-under-gun-dark-night-newtown-speaking-difficult," The hype machine singled out some clear, if tragic, winners from the lineup of this year’s Sundance Film Festival. For instance, there was Other People, SNL writer Chris Kelly’s heartfelt, semi-autobiographical film starring Molly Shannon as a mother with a terminal cancer diagnosis. Not to mention Birth of a Nation, a film about the Nat Turner Rebellion that won Sundance’s domestic drama category—and then sold to Fox Searchlight for an unprecedented $17.5 million. But some of the most difficult films to watch from this year’s crop are among the most important. Reflecting the intensity of the national conversation, the festival included an impressive four entries on the topic of gun violence in the United States. With Republican legislators—and plenty of Democrats—quavering before the NRA, afraid to broach even the most modest changes to save American lives in the middle of a true national emergency, these four films are exactly what we need. Under the Gun Under the Gun, the latest from Fed Up director Stephanie Soechtig, delivers a masterfully crafted, well-researched look at the Second Amendment debate from a (mostly) measured gun control perspective. Narrated by Katie Couric, the film’s viewpoint is supported by interviews with leading researchers and experts (including Mother Jones‘ National Affairs editor Mark Follman) who make the case for reasonable checks on gun freedoms. We also hear from gun owners and guns rights activists. But if it’s not obvious enough where the producers are coming from, the film ends with a call to action, urging legislators to enact universal background checks and other “common-sense” measures. Which is not to say Under the Gun lacks emotional impact. Soechtig spends time in Newtown, Connecticut—she was raised in neighboring Brookfield—with families who lost children at Sandy Hook, and she chronicles the painstaking recovery of Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman shot in the head in 2011 by a deranged gunman. All of this makes for some very heartrending scenes. But Soechtig takes her case beyond Newtown and Aurora and Isla Vista to tackle the epidemic of street killings in Chicago, a problem she argues is just as important, and as preventable, as the mass shootings, given proper legislation. The film is nothing if not comprehensive. Under the Gun also delves into the innocuous roots and notorious progression of the National Rifle Association. We learn how gun control laws passed in the 1960s were repealed in 1986 and how Congress neglected to pass universal background checks after Newtown—or since. We also learn how, to this day, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms is prohibited from computerizing its records; thus hobbled by Congress, the ATF has literal shipping containers full of paper files—the 1,400 gun-trace requests it receives daily must be processed by hand. And then there’s the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which had the temerity to declare gun violence a public health issue and is now prohibited by Congress from using federal money for research on gun violence. Informed viewers will already be familiar with a lot of this stuff, but the details are mind-boggling. As the mother of an Aurora victim puts it to the politicians, “I don’t want your ‘I’m sorrys’ and I don’t want your prayers. I want your action.” Newtown  To sum up the documentary Newtown in two words: heartbreaking and effective. The film doesn’t address the politics of gun control directly but focuses instead on three families who lost children at Sandy Hook, the second-deadliest mass shooting in American history. These grieving parents have been unyielding in their fight for common-sense gun legislation, speaking to Congress, traveling with President Barack Obama, and pleading with legislators to close legal loopholes and pass even the most basic limits—all to little avail. But beyond this, director Kim Snyder sidesteps the political to focus on the personal, documenting the trials of a community still in mourning years after the national media has lost interest. “I still dread that every day I live, I’m one day farther away from my life with Daniel,” says the father of a dead first grader. Will their bucolic small town ever regain a sense of normalcy? Seventeen composers, moved by Snyder’s concept, signed on to deliver a beautiful score. As a native of Fairfield County, where Newtown is located, this moving film rendered me speechless and tearful. Dark Night Directed by Tim Sutton (Pavilion, Memphis), Dark Night is fictional film that draws on the 2012 Aurora shooting for inspiration. There’s an art house feel to the cinematography that, combined with minimal dialogue—and the unearthly vocals of Maica Amata—contribute to a series of eerie, parallel narratives about strangers who will ultimately attend a late-night screening that ends in tragedy. We meet myriad characters, all played by nonactors, going about their monotonous days in suburban Florida, where inactivity seems to breed violence. At first, it’s not clear who the shooter will be. The socially outcast homebody? The skater with hair dyed orange (like the Aurora shooter)? The college student eager for revenge on the girl who rejected him? The beautiful composition of the film, paired with the jarring looks into the lives of its characters, creates a feeling of unease that pervades the film—and the real Aurora and Lafayette theater shootings make an appearance as TV news and radio broadcasts. There’s no call to action here, no appeal to viewer pathos, just a story of what happens when a disturbed youth in a state notorious for its lax gun laws decides to act on his delusions. As with Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler’s film about the fatal police shooting on a Bay Area light-rail platform, Dark Night opens with the climactic event and then flashes back to the beginning of the day. You don’t see the shooting itself, but that in no way diminishes the horror. Speaking Is Difficult Director AJ Schnack has created a bone-chilling short (14 minutes) that is neither fiction nor documentary, exactly. Speaking Is Difficult chronicles mass shootings in 25 American cities, starting with the recent ones in San Bernardino, California, and Colorado Springs and moving backward in time to the 2011 shooting in the parking lot of a Safeway in Tucson, Arizona, that left six people dead and Rep. Gabby Giffords critically wounded. Schnack superimposes spine-tingling 911 tracks over footage shot at each scene. The title comes from Giffords’ moving appeal to Congress in January 2013, two years into her recovery. “Speaking is difficult,” Giffords told her former colleagues. “But I need to say something important. Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something. It will be hard, but the time is now. You must act. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you.” Indeed.  Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

          / CBS/AP SEATTLE -- A coroner in Washington state on Saturday released the identity of a gunman and three of his four victims in what authorities described as a mass shooting and suicide. David Wayne Campbell, 51, shot and killed himself Friday in front of police who said they tried for more than three hours to get him to surrender, said Mason County Coroner Wes Stockwell. In an outbuilding on the remote, wooded property near Belfair, southwest of Seattle, authorities found four bodies, including those of his wife of six years, Lana J. Carlson, 49, and her sons, Quinn and Tory Carlson, who were 16 and 18, respectively. Stockwell said he was withholding the identity of the fourth victim pending notification of relatives. On Friday morning, Campbell called a police officer he previously knew and reported that he had shot his family. The officer traveled across Puget Sound from Seattle and responded to the home, as did a Mason County SWAT team. For 3 1/2 hours, a deputy sergeant tried to persuade the man to surrender, but he finally walked outside and shot himself, the sheriff's office said. A 12-year-old girl was able to escape the house and survive, CBS affiliate KIRO reported. She was taken to a hospital, but she had not been shot, authorities said. ""Apparently she's OK,"" Chief Deputy Ryan Spurling said. ""I don't know if this is a daughter, or stepdaughter, or what the relationship is, but she escaped from the house."" ""It's a terrible tragedy,"" said Sheriff Casey Salisbury. ""It's just as tragic I think for law enforcement and the emergency service workers that are up there as well."" Authorities did not detail the previous interaction between the shooter and the officer he called. Jack Pigott, who lives down the road, said he heard gunshots Thursday night but none Friday. Campbell and Carlson were married in November 2009, King County records show. The wife had two teenage sons who were adopted from Russia during a previous marriage, Pigott said, as well as a daughter who was adopted from China. Her previous husband died of cancer, he said. Campbell ran a business called Campbell Family Heating and Air Conditioning, according to state records, while Carlson -- who also went by Lana Jane Campbell -- had registered a business called Crispy Edges. She had purchased a food truck, and she and Campbell had been working on the truck but had not been able to secure the county permits needed to operate it, Pigott said. The neighbor also said Campbell had recently been hospitalized, but he didn't know why. ""He's heavily medicated with something,"" Pigott said. ""I've never seen him drinking."" It was common for the family to do shooting practice, Pigott said. That's what he assumed Thursday's gunfire was. ""I was getting a load of wood into the house, and I hear some gunshots,"" he said.

It’s about Americans being compelled to become agents of the heavy-handed state. Apple warned Thursday that if the government successfully forces the company to help the FBI extract information from the iPhone of a dead terrorist, innocent people could be conscripted into all manner of work for the state, from executing prisoners to setting bait for criminals. “There is no reason why the government could not deploy its new authority to compel other innocent and unrelated third-parties to do its bidding in the name of law enforcement,” Apple’s lawyers wrote in a motion asking a federal judge to annul a search warrant that would compel the company to bypass a security feature on the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, last year that was allegedly inspired by ISIS. “For example, under the same legal theories advocated by the government here, the government could argue that it should be permitted to force citizens to do all manner of things ‘necessary’ to assist it in enforcing the laws, like compelling a pharmaceutical company against its will to produce drugs needed to carry out a lethal injection in furtherance of a lawfully issued death warrant, or requiring a journalist to plant a false story in order to help lure out a fugitive, or forcing a software company to insert malicious code in its autoupdate process that makes it easier for the government to conduct court-ordered surveillance,” Apple argued. From Apple’s perspective, the government is not just heading toward a slippery slope, but over a cliff. At the center of Apple’s argument against what it describes as an alarming overreach by the government is the All Writs Act, a law that has been used to ensure that law enforcement authorities can carry out a court-issued search warrant. Apple says the statute is being inappropriately applied and that the Justice Department’s demands could herald a new era of government-enforced compliance. “Indeed, under the government’s formulation, any party whose assistance is deemed ‘necessary’ by the government falls within the ambit of the All Writs Act and can be compelled to do anything the government needs to effectuate a lawful court order,” Apple argued. “While these sweeping powers might be nice to have from the government’s perspective, they simply are not authorized by law and would violate the Constitution.” Two U.S. officials who are not authorized to discuss the Apple case with journalists told The Daily Beast that Justice Department officials were confident that they would succeed in forcing Apple to help investigators extract information from the phone. But these officials also said they were uncomfortable relying on the All Writs Act, not because they think it’s an illegitimate law, but because Apple can mount a compelling case—mainly in the court of public opinion—that that law is being applied here with potentially dangerous consequences. “The government’s reliance on the All Writs Act raises serious questions whether there’s an outer limit to what the government can ask a third party to do,” Mieke Eoyang, the vice president for the national security program at Third Way, a think tank in Washington, D.C., told The Daily Beast. “Apple may lay out hypotheticals that seem far-fetched, but the government isn’t setting out limiting principles here, so no one knows where the boundaries are.” And there, it seems, is the heart of Apple’s strategy in the San Bernardino case. In painting dire hypotheticals about what the government insists is a narrow, technical question—whether Apple can be compelled to help the government inspect one iPhone—the company is making a far broader argument. At times, the motion seemed to be written not so much to win the argument in court—though Apple surely wants to do that—but to frame a public debate that will last for months, if not years, to come. Apple has left no doubt this week that it intends to make a case in the court of public opinion. CEO Tim Cook has written about the company’s concerns on Apple’s website and in a letter to employees that was reprinted in the press. (That letter followed a blog post by FBI Director Jim Comey, who said, “The San Bernardino litigation isn’t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message. It is about the victims and justice.”) Cook also told an interview ABC News this week that forcing Apple to create the means to bypass a key security feature on the iPhone was the “software equivalent of cancer.” “We think it’s bad news to write. We would never write it. We have never written it—and that is what is at stake here,” Cook said. On Thursday morning, hours before Apple filed its motion, Comey told the House Intelligence Committee that the FBI was only asking Apple to help extract information from the iPhone used by the shooter, repeating his insistence that the government doesn’t seek a “back door” into the iPhone operating system used on millions of devices. But in that testimony, Comey also acknowledged that the ruling in the San Bernardino case would have implications far beyond just one phone. The decision “will guide how judges look at similar requests,” Comey said. But, he added, “The larger question isn’t going to be answered in the courts nor should it be.” In that respect, Comey seemed to agree with Apple, which wrote in its motion that Congress, not courts, should decide matters of profound consequence for millions of people who use technology every day. Further, Apple argued, Congress had the opportunity to write a law that would require companies to assist the government with circumventing encryption technology, as the FBI wants to do in the San Bernardino case. But lawmakers chose not to act, and the Obama administration decided not to press the issue. Apple pointed to a 1994 law known as the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which it said “made clear that a company has no obligation” to assist the government in decrypting communications when “the company does not retain a copy of the decryption key.” Apple doesn’t know, nor can it discover, the passcode that Farook used on his phone. And the security feature that the FBI wants disabled would render the information on the phone inaccessible if someone incorrectly guesses the passcode 10 times. The FBI wants to turn that feature off and use a computer to make millions of passcode guesses rapidly until it lands on the right one. Apple sees that as the “back door” that undermines the strong encryption technology at the heart of the iPhone operating system, which it said in the motion keeps people safe from “hackers, identity thieves, hostile foreign agents, and unwarranted government surveillance.” Eoyang said that technology companies have long understood what is and isn’t required of them under the 1994 law, and that the government now threatens to confuse the legal landscape using a much older statute. “Industry thought that their obligations were clearly defined under CALEA, so reviving the All Writs Act from 1789 is introducing great uncertainty for not just Apple, but all kinds of tech companies,” Eoyang said. Apple went a step further, and said that by backing away from passing a new law and “invoking ‘terrorism,’” the government “sought to cut off debate and circumvent thoughtful analysis.”",2016-02-25 18:20:00,Apple: It’s Us or Fascism,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
239,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/david-wayne-campbell-washington-shooting,"SEATTLE (AP) — A coroner in Washington state on Saturday released the identity of a gunman and three of his four victims in what authorities described as a mass shooting and suicide. David Wayne Campbell, 51, shot and killed himself Friday in front of police who said they tried for more than three hours to get him to surrender, said Mason County Coroner Wes Stockwell. In an outbuilding on the remote, wooded property near Belfair, southwest of Seattle, authorities found four bodies, including those of his wife of six years, Lana J. Carlson, 49, and her sons, Quinn and Tory Carlson, who were 16 and 18, respectively. Stockwell said he was withholding the identity of the fourth victim pending notification of relatives. On Friday morning, Campbell called a police officer he previously knew and reported that he had shot his family. The officer traveled across Puget Sound from Seattle and responded to the home, as did a Mason County SWAT team. For 3½ hours, a deputy sergeant tried to persuade the man to surrender, but he finally walked outside and shot himself, the sheriff’s office said. A 12-year-old girl was able to escape the house and survive. She was taken to a hospital, but she had not been shot, authorities said. “Apparently she’s OK,” Chief Deputy Ryan Spurling said. “I don’t know if this is a daughter, or stepdaughter, or what the relationship is, but she escaped from the house.” Jack Pigott, who lives down the road, said he heard gunshots Thursday night but none Friday. Campbell and Carlson were married in November 2009, King County records show. The wife had two teenage sons who were adopted from Russia during a previous marriage, Pigott said, as well as a daughter who was adopted from China. Her previous husband died of cancer, he said. Campbell ran a business called Campbell Family Heating and Air Conditioning, according to state records, while Carlson — who also went by Lana Jane Campbell — had registered a business called Crispy Edges. She had purchased a food truck, and she and Campbell had been working on the truck but had not been able to secure the county permits needed to operate it, Pigott said. The neighbor also said Campbell had recently been hospitalized, but he didn’t know why. “He’s heavily medicated with something,” Pigott said. “I’ve never seen him drinking.” It was common for the family to do shooting practice, Pigott said. That’s what he assumed Thursday’s gunfire was. “I was getting a load of wood into the house, and I hear some gunshots,” he said. “Four or five, a pause and then another round.” ___ Associated Press writers Martha Bellisle in Seattle and Manuel Valdes in Belfair contributed.

241,http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/02/there_were_hints_christie_would_endorse_trump.html,"Christie Trump Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stands with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie before a rally in Fort Worth, Texas, Friday, Feb. 26, 2016. (AP Photo | LM Otero) Christie endorsed Trump. TRENTON -- Hours after verbally eviscerating U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida  during a Republican presidential debate Feb. 6, Gov. Chris Christie speculated on national television that maybe it was time to rough up GOP front-runner Donald Trump. Four days later, after a disappointing sixth-place finish in New Hampshire, Christie ended his presidential bid. The televised mano-a-mano battle never occurred. On Friday, Christie endorsed the billionaire former reality television star, declaring, ""There was no better fighter for the American people."" Christie to appear with Trump on the trail While there were instances in which Christie sharply questioned the viability of some of Trump's ideas while out on the stump, the blunt-talking governor passed up numerous opportunities to skewer him. Pundits at the time speculated he didn't want to alienate Trump's supporters should he leave the race. In the wake of Christie endorsing Trump on Friday, here are examples in which the sharp-tongued governor refused to engage or chose to speak positively about the front-runner: * He started his campaign speaking fondly of Trump, telling one of his first town hall audiences in New Hampshire about the time Trump's sister arranged the two to meet when he was U.S. attorney and that they've been friends ever since. * When the novelty of Trump entering dominated the news cycle last summer, Christie was asked many times what he thought of the former casino magnate. He said: ""I think he's a really wonderful guy, always been a good friend to me and to Mary Pat ... If he wants to be a serious candidate, he can be a serious candidate. That's totally up to him. He's a very bright guy, a very successful guy, and we'll see what happens."" * Christie was always getting questions about Trump -- what was he like? Why is he so popular? ""I think what Donald has tapped into -- for a period of time -- is just the complete anger and disgust with both parties in Washington,"" Christie told an audience at an Iowa town hall meeting. ""And Donald says: 'Everyone is Washington is a loser; I'm a winner. I'll win in Washington. Everyone else is a loser!' people go, 'Yeah! Yeah, he's got something there. Everyone in Washington is a loser. He's rich. Maybe that makes him a winner. OK.'"" * Trump in December called for a ""complete shutdown on all Muslims"" entering the country after the Paris bombings and the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Christie called the ban ridiculous, but he bristled when reporters asked whether Trump was a bigot. ""I've known Donald Trump for 13 years. I can disagree with him and I have. I don't believe he's hateful and I don't believe he's a bigot."" * Trump insisted that thousands of people could be seen cheering in Jersey City as the Twin Towers fell on 9/11. Asked to respond, Christie said he didn't recall, because he was worried about his wife and brother who were in lower Manhattan that day.  ""I think if it had happened, I would remember it, but, you know, there could be things I forget, too."" He would be pressed numerous times to confirm or discredit Trump's statement that week. Finally, he said: ""There's no film or video of it to prove it. He says he saw it on TV. It didn't happen.""

        Nathan McDermott Posted on February 16, 2016, at 4:01 p.m. ET Speaking at a campaign event in Greenville, South Carolina on Tuesday, Bill Clinton incorrectly said the married couple who perpetrated a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, had never been to the Middle East. One of the shooters was raised in the region; the other had made several trips. The former president was discussing the need to have a robust defense policy without undermining America’s core values when he made the comments. “We got to have a strong defense, we got to have tough diplomacy. Also, in a world where the borders look more like nets than walls,"" Clinton said. ""Keep in mind, the people that perpetrated that travesty in San Bernardino had never been to the Middle East. They were converted over the social media."" Tashfeen Malik was born in Pakistan and lived in Saudi Arabia for most of her life. Syed Rizwan Farook, Malik’s American-born husband, had also been to Saudi Arabia multiple times, including for several weeks in 2013 as part of the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that Muslims are required to take at least once in their lifetime. Farook traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2014 and returned with Malik after they had met online. Soon after, they married in California. Although Malik expressed her allegiance to jihadist groups through social media, there has been no evidence to formally link the shooters, or their plot, to any larger terrorist organization, and officials have said the couple may have been self-radicalized.

244,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/29/vermont-gun-lobby-sanders-clinton-suicides?CMP=share_btn_tw,"As its senator is forced to fight his presidential opponent over his record on gun control, the New England state is home to a push to educate sellers Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.17 BST When Vermont considered tightening its gun laws last year, hundreds of citizens wearing hunter orange showed up at the state house to protest.  Bernie Sanders’ home state has some of the most gun-friendly laws in the nation. It also has the nation’s lowest violent crime rate. The push to require universal background checks on gun sales failed almost immediately. But gun rights advocates didn’t stop with defeating background checks legislation. Vermont had only six gun murders in 2014, but according to statistics from the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it had 59 gun suicides. “We do have a small problem with suicides in the state. It’s not huge, like the anti-gunners say, but it is a problem,” said Ed Cutler, president of Gun Owners of Vermont, which labels itself a “no-compromise” gun rights organization. At the same time as they fought back against new regulations, Cutler and other gun rights leaders proposed a different approach: educating gun owners about suicide risk and how to de-stigmatize seeking mental health treatment. A year later, the state affiliate of the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of Vermont are rolling out a program to bring suicide awareness to gun stores, ranges, and clubs. They will also host training on how to talk to friends in crisis about getting help. “This is not an anti-gun or a veiled anti-gun campaign – this is strictly us helping ourselves,” said Chris Bradley, president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs, Vermont’s state NRA group. Experts from the state’s department of mental health have worked closely on the project, but gun rights groups are leading the public outreach. They have vetted every poster and fact sheet to make sure the suicide prevention message is not mixed with anti-gun rhetoric. It is a very different approach from the fight over gun laws and gun industry regulation that has become a key part of the presidential battle between Sanders and Hillary Clinton, in which Vermont will vote this week, as one of the potentially crucial Super Tuesday primaries. Nationwide, gun suicides represent nearly two-thirds of annual gun deaths. Public mass-casualty shootings like the ones this past week in Hesston, Kansas, and Kalamazoo, Michigan, represent only a tiny fraction of the overall toll. Nationwide, the group most at risk for gun suicide are white, middle-aged men. While gun homicide rates have remained mostly flat since 2000, gun suicide rates are rising. About half of America’s gun suicides involve a firearm, a means of suicide that is almost always lethal. Studies have found that many people act within less than an hour of deciding to kill themselves – and some within minutes of the decision. While people some who survive a suicide attempt will try again, 90% will not ultimately die from suicide. For many, a suicidal crisis can be very brief. That means, researchers say, that finding ways to limit people’s access to firearms in the midst of that crisis could be a key factor in saving lives. Educating gun dealers to look for signs of suicide risk is one line of defense. But many Americans most at risk already own guns. The approach being tested in Vermont is whether more education about suicide risk might persuade some gun owners to let their friends keep their guns for them when they’re experiencing depression or going though a divorce, a job loss, or another difficult time. “A lot of our members, they’re terrified they’re going to have their guns taken away,” said Cutler, the Gun Owners of Vermont president. He said he believes the focus on using laws to disqualify people with mental health problems from owning guns ends up discouraging gun owners from seeking mental health treatment at all. Taking a friends-helping-friends approach will work better, he said. “We can hold their guns for them, talk to them, get them counseling, and once it’s over and done with, we’ll give them their guns back and there won’t be stigma attached. “Gun owners trust gun owners.” Clinton, who has emphasized her willingness to go after the gun lobby to help prevent gun violence, has said very little about suicide. Her campaign policy page on gun violence prevention notes that “about 33,000 Americans are killed by guns each year” but does not mention that roughly 20,000 of those deaths are suicides. Her list of strategies to prevent this “unacceptable” death toll makes no mention of suicide at all. A campaign spokeswoman said Clinton’s support for expanding background checks and federal research on gun violence would help to reduce suicide, as would her support for improving existing laws focused on prohibiting people “suffering from severe mental illness from purchasing or possessing a gun”. The spokeswoman cited a study from the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety that found dramatically lower rates of gun suicide in states that require background checks for all handgun sales than in states that do not. But the study does not control for rates of firearm ownership. In an academic study that found a correlation between tough gun laws and lower rates of gun death, when the researchers controlled for the number of guns in a state, the link “essentially disappeared”. A spokesman for Sanders’ campaign touted the senator’s past efforts to expand mental health access, especially for veterans at risk of suicide, and pointed to his single-payer health insurance plan, designed to provide access to mental health services to all Americans. He also cited Sanders’ support for improving the nation’s background check system for firearm purchases. Sanders’ approach to gun policy has long stayed in line with that of his rural state, which has high rates of gun ownership and strong support for gun rights even among Democratic leaders. When universal background checks were debated last year, Vermont’s Democratic governor said he thought the state’s laws were perfectly adequate. Over the past few months, as Clinton has continued to hammer him on guns, Sanders has moved towards more gun control-friendly positions. Clinton has hit hardest on Sanders’ vote in favor of a 2005 federal law that protects firearm manufacturers, distributors and dealers against lawsuits over the criminal misuse of their products. In January, Sanders told reporters that he would cosponsor a bill to repeal this gun industry shield law. A repeal of the law could open up a new series of lawsuits by gun control groups seeking to hold firearms manufacturers and distributors responsible for monitoring whether their products end up in the hands of people with criminal records. In Vermont, the suicide prevention effort also focuses on gun dealers, but organizers are appealing to empathy and moral responsibility, not legal liability. Bradley, the president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs, said most gun sellers he knows have had the experience of selling a gun to a customer who later used it to kill themselves. “To say it weighs heavily on someone is a horrible understatement,” he said. On Friday, Bradley brought a stack of suicide prevention materials to a gun dealer in Barre, just south of Vermont’s capital, Montpelier. Rather than having the state’s department of mental health deliver the posters and fact sheets, gun owners are doing all of the delivery and education themselves. It gives credibility to the campaign, Bradley said – and makes it clear the materials are a service gun advocates are providing, rather than another mandated requirement from the state. At R&L Archery, a large, family-run outdoor goods store, Bradley waited while Jon Sanborn, the store’s vice-president, finished with a customer who would need to update his address on his ID before he could pass a background check. Then he spread out the campaign’s new posters on the counter and made his pitch. “The whole idea is to establish a dialogue,” he said. “I’m not a psychologist and you’re not a psychologist.” “Clearly,” Sanborn broke in, drily. Sanborn said he liked the materials designed to educate store employees about being watchful for signs of suicide. But he did not have a positive reaction to the poster designed to reach people at risk of suicide, which had “Thinking about suicide?” in red letters at the top. “I don’t love that for the front of my store,” he said. Ninety-nine percent of his customers, he said, would not be associating buying a gun with suicide, and he did not want to put that thought in their heads. But he said he did support the broader project of putting more focus on suicide prevention. “There’s never been any awareness on our end,” he said. “Warning signs – things to look for, that kind of thing, none of that has propagated through the gun world.” Most people have some kind of personal connection to gun suicides, Sanborn said, as well as knowing that they have sold a few guns to people who have used them to kill themselves. “It does cast the rest of our industry and the rest of our hobbies in such a negative light,” he said. “Any of the political speeches you look at – Hillary Clinton had one at the end of last year – 92 people a day are killed by firearms, and if you look at the number, those are true, but 60-some odd of those 90 are suicide.” He said the Vermont Gun Shop project was the first initiative he had seen to actually work through firearm dealers to tackle that problem. On Saturday, at the Snowsville General Store in Randolph, store owner Eugene Booska also said he was willing to participate in the new suicide prevention program, though he had not seen the new materials yet. Booska’s store stocks milk and eggs as well as guns, and is heated by an old-fashioned wood-burning stove. “They asked me if I would support, to help to pass out information,” Booska said. “I think it’s fine, and I will pass it out. I don’t know as it’s going to work very well.” Choosing not to sell one gun to someone who seems at risk might not prevent them from killing themselves, he said. “Most guys that I sell guns to have already got a lot of guns.” Booska’s wife, Kris, said she has sometimes trusted her gut instinct and refused to sell someone a gun, even if they have passed a background check. Firearms dealers always have the option to refuse a sale. But she also remembers selling a gun to someone who later killed himself, and she did not see any red flags. She remembers him talking about the death of his dog, and comforting him, but: “I did not have any inkling that he intended to kill himself.” If I’d been educated about what to look for, perhaps I would have seen something more that I didn’t see. Or if, you know, I had like a script of something you might say to somebody.” Vermont’s suicide prevention program is modelled on that of New Hampshire. In 2009, one New Hampshire gun store had three customers buy firearms and use them to kill themselves within the space of a week. The gun store owner began to work with public health experts to figure out what his store might have been able to do differently to prevent this tragedy. The result was the New Hampshire Gun Shop project, rolled out in 2011, which educates gun store employees about signs of suicide risk and how to use casual conversation with customers to check for red flags, as well as using gun stores as a place to spread public awareness about gun suicide and ways to get help. A study of the project found roughly half of gun stores in New Hampshire were displaying program materials. The ultimate effect of the effort on suicide rates has yet to be measured. But according to Cathy Barber, the director of the Means Matter suicide prevention campaign at the Harvard School of Public Health, variations of the New Hampshire model are being tested in at least 14 states, including Vermont. Ten more states are in early stages of developing the program, she said. Because gun owners and their families are affected by suicide at higher rates than non-gun owners, taking an anti-gun approach to suicide prevention is, as Barber often puts it, “like sending an anti-gay group to do a suicide prevention campaign in the gay and lesbian community”. Vermont’s leading gun control group does back the new suicide prevention campaign. Ann Braden, the head of Gun Sense Vermont, said she was delighted when she heard Cutler bring up the New Hampshire Gun Shop Project at a state hearing. “It was like the world had become all sparkly,” she said. Her group will continue to push for a state universal background check law in 2017, she said. But she added that it was “very refreshing” to have her gun rights opponents working on a prevention program of their own, “rather than a no to everything”.",2016-02-29 07:00:07,Vermont gun lobby bypasses Sanders v Clinton in attempt to cut down suicides,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

For political watchers eagerly anticipating another South Carolina primary filled with campaign subterfuge, the last week did not disappoint. That’s largely thanks to the efforts of one candidate in particular, Ted Cruz, who rose to meet the state’s well-deserved reputation for political skulduggery with all the glee befitting a man whose campaign mailed fake checks to voters and spread false rumors during the Iowa caucuses that Ben Carson was dropping out of the race. Because it’s gotten hard to keep track of all of Cruz’s “dirty tricks,” we’ve collected the seven most egregious examples in the past seven days leading up to Saturday’s primary. Vote your heart out, South Carolina. The Cruz campaign releases a Photoshopped image of Rubio and Obama shaking hands View on Twitter No one in the G.O.P. field wants to be photographed with Barack Obama, much less photographed shaking his hand while smiling. Yet that is exactly what Marco Rubio appears to be doing in a Photoshopped image that the Cruz campaign displayed on an anti-Rubio Web site this week, alongside a caption accusing him of supporting three of Obama’s trade deals. After his team insisted at first that the photo was authentic, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler shrugged off the apoplectic Rubio campaign. “If Rubio has a better picture of him shaking hands with Barack Obama, I'm happy to swap it out,” he told CNN Thursday. Voters receive Spanish-language robocall claiming Rubio supports amnesty Over the last week, voters in South Carolina received a robocall, recorded in Spanish, that targeted Rubio for allegedly supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants. Approximately 5 percent of South Carolinians are Hispanic, and only 72 percent of them speak Spanish at home, suggesting that the call was designed as much for its dog-whistle effect as the substance of the attack. As the Huffington Post noted, the woman on the recording heavily emphasizes the words “Marco Rubio,” “amnistía,” and “inmigración ilegal,” words that an English-speaking Republican would grasp immediately. “The recording is most likely an effort to make non-Spanish-speaking voters believe that Rubio is calling Hispanics and promising amnesty,” reporter Igor Bobic speculated. The Cruz campaign denied that they were behind the call, which emphasized that Cruz, unlike Rubio, was against amnesty. Another pro-Cruz robocall slams Trump for speaking out against the Confederate Flag “Put it in a museum, let it go,” the voice of Donald Trump says in another robocall voters are receiving in South Carolina, The Post and Courier reported Friday. “That’s Donald Trump supporting Nikki Haley removing the battle flag from the Confederate memorial in Columbia,” the pre-recorded message then says, adding that people should keep their opinions to themselves. “Trump talks about our flag like it’s a social disease.” The Courageous Conservative Political Action Committee, the pro-Cruz super-PAC behind the call, provoked a swift rebuke from a Trump spokesman, who called it “the same old trash and more signs of desperation.” The Cruz campaign has yet to comment. A fake Facebook profile for Trey Gowdy renounces Rubio and endorses Cruz South Carolina congressman Trey Gowdy, who has endorsed Rubio, was understandably ticked off when a Facebook account called “Trey Gowdy Prayers” posted that his endorsement was a “grave mistake,” accusing Rubio of lacking “integrity, intillect [sic], and foresight,” and endorsing Cruz instead. “The truth actually matters to me and to all South Carolinians,” Gowdy said in a statement Tuesday. “Unfortunately it appears that the campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz may not place the same value on waging a contest based on the truth and facts.” The Cruz campaign immediately denounced the ad as “deplorable” and claimed they “had absolutely nothing to do with this fraudulent Facebook post.” A pro-Cruz ad suggests Rubio bears responsibility for a terrorist attack At least one attack was so deplorable that South Carolina television stations decided not to air it. That ad, produced by a pro-Cruz super-PAC, implied that Rubio’s immigration record—including alleged support for “sanctuary cities”—bore responsibility for the mass shooting in San Bernardino last December. The PAC in question said they had no idea why the stations had pulled the ads, as it had “aired statewide on both television and digital in Iowa with no objection, receiving hundreds of thousands of views on digital.” Another pro-Cruz ad incites the threat of a lawsuit Earlier this week, Donald Trump actually threatened to sue Cruz for implying that he was pro-choice in an ad airing in South Carolina. Cruz—who, to be fair, used footage of Trump himself saying 15 years ago that he was pro-choice, before he allegedly changed his mind—welcomed the threat, saying that he looked forward to taking Trump’s deposition. But God forbid that someone do the same to Cruz. According to Politico, his campaign recently sent a complaint to South Carolina television stations asking them to stop airing a super-PAC-funded ad portraying Cruz as “weak” on national security and immigration, saying that the stations were legally liable for making a “flatly false factual claim.” American Future Fund, the PAC that ran the ad, released a statement pointing out the irony of Cruz complaining on the very same day he dismissed Trump’s own objections. Ted Cruz pretends he can speak Spanish Once upon a time—as recently as a year ago—Cruz was open about his inability to speak Spanish, even gaining a modicum of sympathy after Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin attempted to goad him into speaking en español. But apparently, Cruz has the unusual ability to become fully fluent only when Marco Rubio calls him out on the debate stage, as he did last Saturday. Cruz memorizing just the right amount of Spanish phrases might be the biggest dirty trick of all. By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

249,http://www.opednews.com/articles/What-s-at-Stake-in-Apple-s-by-John-Kiriakou-Apple-Ceo-Tim-Cook_Email_Hackers_Intelligence-160302-426.html,"Reprinted from Other Words Civil liberties fans in the United States recently got an unlikely champion: the CEO of Apple. In a high-profile spat with the White House, Tim Cook has emerged as a leading spokesperson against the Obama administration's efforts to weaken Americans' constitutional protections and civil liberties. In particular, Cook is fighting a federal order that would force Apple to create software to bypass the iPhone's security features -- and give the FBI access to the phone and everything on it. He sent a letter to all Apple users explaining the company's position and promising to keep up the fight. Here's what's at stake. The FBI is investigating last December's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. It wants access to the iPhone used by suspected terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook, who carried out the shooting together with his wife Tashfeen Malik. But here's the controversial part: The feds basically want Apple to create a software ""backdoor"" that would allow the FBI to access the phone's information remotely. The FBI insists this is a one-off request. But that's ridiculous: Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. Indeed, the FBI is already seeking access to iPhones in nine other cases. The constitutional implications are chilling. If the government gets its way, nothing would be private. With a secret order from a judge, your phone company or manufacturer could have to provide all the information on your phone to the FBI, including call logs, text messages, emails, chat transcripts, and even photos. They won't just find out if you're talking with ""terrorists,"" of course. Are you calling a secret girlfriend or boyfriend? Are you talking with an abortion provider -- or a psychiatrist? What kind of porn do you look at? If it's on your phone, the government would get to know about it. Nothing would be private. Nothing would be sacred. And worse yet, those same tools the FBI wants could easily fall into the hands of hackers, criminals, or even foreign intelligence services. Once Pandora's box opens, there's no closing it. There's another issue at play here, too: The FBI dropped the ball on Syed Rizwan Farook months ago, so now it's trying to cover its mistakes. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN in December, for example, that Farook had been in touch with ""more than one terrorism suspect"" the FBI was already investigating. That was well before he carried out the shootings. Why wasn't the FBI intercepting his communications then, when they could've gotten a warrant? Why was there no authorized surveillance? It's because the FBI botched the case, and now they're trying to make up for it by turning Apple -- and privacy -- into the bad guys.

251,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/us/mosque-near-university-of-arizona-endures-scorn-of-students-next-door.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Fernanda Santos TUCSON — Rania Kanawati, a Syrian immigrant, was walking to her car after Friday Prayer last month at the Islamic Center of Tucson when a beer can landed right behind her, then another one fell by her side. On another night at the mosque, Ahmed Meiloud, a Ph.D. candidate from Mauritania who is the Islamic Center’s president, was leaving the building when someone yelled from a passing car, “Terrorist, go back to where you came from!” The diverse congregation of the Islamic Center — a squat copper-domed complex just outside the University of Arizona’s campus — has endured taunts and vandalism ever since hundreds of students moved into two private high-rise apartments next door three years ago. In at least one instance, a shower of crushed peanuts rained down on the mosque; more typically, cans and bottles are flung from apartment balconies, usually on the party nights of Friday and Saturday. “Yes, these are students, usually drunken students, but these attacks aren’t random,” Mr. Meiloud said. “We are the target.” No one has been injured. But in light of the highly charged national debate about accepting Muslim refugees in the United States — as well as the mass shooting by two Muslim terrorists in San Bernardino, Calif., in December — tensions over the insults and vandalism here have run particularly high. “We can’t ignore the backdrop against which this is happening, with all the hate crimes against Muslims, all over the place,” said Imraan Siddiqi, the executive director of Arizona’s chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In recent months, Islamophobic posters have appeared at American University; the University of California, Los Angeles; and other college campuses. At Virginia Tech, the message “I will be here 11/11/2015 to kill all muslims” was scrawled on a bathroom wall. In October, an Indiana University student was arrested after trying to yank a Muslim woman’s head scarf as she dined outside a restaurant, according to the police in Bloomington, Ind. The University of Arizona has a diverse student body, and students and professors described its culture as generally inclusive. But minority groups on campus say they are not immune from mistreatment and misconceptions. Meetings between faculty members and students were held in six campus cultural centers at the university during the fall, spurred by racially charged episodes at the University of Missouri and elsewhere. According to faculty notes on the meetings, gay students spoke of harassment by classmates, black students told of being steered away from disciplines and degrees that were perceived as white-only, and Asian students talked about “unhealthy generalizations,” in particular about Muslims. Lynn Nadel, a professor of psychology and cognitive sciences and the chairman of the university’s faculty, said the meetings served as a call for action. “We don’t need to wait for the explosion to look around and find out for ourselves how we’re doing and how we must change,” he said. Despite repeated efforts by the university and the managers of the apartment complex to stop the harassment of the mosque and its members, problems have persisted. Mumina Obeid, a premed student at the university and a Sunday school teacher at the Islamic Center, said that more than once she had picked up liquor bottles littering the turf where children play during recess. Ms. Obeid, 20, who was born in Tucson to a Syrian father and a Mexican mother, said a 5-year-old boy had come up to her holding a can of chewing tobacco he found on the playground. “What kind of message are we sending to our children when their place of worship is treated like a trash can?” she asked. The high-rise rental complex,  Sol y Luna, says it offers furnished apartments, a rooftop pool, a yoga garden and assigned garage parking, all within two blocks of the campus. A company based in Pennsylvania, GMH Capital Partners, bought the property in the fall and has installed motion-sensitive cameras outside the buildings in an effort to catch offenders. Four residents were evicted under the previous owners, The Arizona Daily Star reported. Last month, when classes at the university resumed and cans and bottles started crashing onto the mosque’s parking lot again, the landlord began considering whether to close the balconies. In a letter to tenants and their parents, Rand A. Ginsburg, a senior vice president at GMH Capital Partners, threatened fines and more evictions, pledging zero tolerance for “actions involving violence or destructive behavior toward other human beings or organizations” and for “words or actions that reflect racial or religious hostility.” The mosque functions as the university’s de facto Muslim center; the Muslim Student Association has an office there. It also serves professors and professionals, as well as immigrants and refugees from Syria, Iraq, Sudan and other countries. “This is a very welcoming community,” said Ms. Kanawati, who left Syria long ago and has been a member of the mosque for 23 years. “But there are exceptions.” The Islamic Center moved to its current location in the 1990s, when the university, whose student body now numbers about 42,000, had roughly 10,000 fewer students. Back then, the tallest buildings in the neighborhood were a handful of stories high. As the university grew and a streetcar linking campus and downtown began operating, the city approved zoning changes allowing high-density buildings — to house students and keep them away from the residential neighborhoods surrounding campus, said Steve Kozachik, a city councilman representing the area. On a recent Friday at the Islamic Center, a boisterous group of women gathered for a meal of homemade dolma, a stuffed vegetable dish, and store-made cake after evening prayers as their children chased one another in the men’s prayer hall. Outside the center, Madalyn Lorber, 18, a sophomore who lives in the high-rise towers, said the only time she thought about the mosque next door was when she had a hard time finding street parking during prayer services on Friday afternoons. “They keep to themselves,” Ms. Lorber said of the mosque members, adding that her apartment faces away from the mosque. Mr. Kozachik convened a meeting last month with representatives from the mosque, the apartment tower, the university and the police. He said he had also asked the city attorney to file civil nuisance charges against the apartment building’s owners if they failed to rein in the problem. Mr. Meiloud, the Islamic Center’s president, said that the mosque’s leadership had considered moving out of the area, but that the idea was soon pushed aside. “We’ll resolve this,” Mr. Meiloud said. “They won’t run us out of here.” Advertisement",2016-02-16 12:01:10,"University of Arizona Students Hurl Insults, and Litter, at Mosque in Tucson",,1,http://nytimes.com
252,http://www.thedailybeast.com/san-bernardino-the-most-twisted-terrorist-plot-yet,"SEARCH 1) Drop off your baby with grandma. 2) Go to your work holiday party to kill the co-workers who threw you a baby shower. 3) Leave a bomb for the rescuers. Special Correspondent The San Bernardino mass shooting was neither the biggest nor the most sophisticated terrorist attack on our shores, but it had to be the most disturbing. If Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik planned the horror on their own—and quite likely they did—they were about to prove themselves as diabolical and sociopathic as ISIS at its worst when they dropped off their 6-month-old daughter with Farook’s mother on Wednesday morning. The Southern California couple then drove to a holiday party being held by Farook’s fellow San Bernardino County health workers in a rented hall at a center for the disabled. Malik seems to have waited outside as Farook joined the festivities just as he had the previous year’s holiday party in the same hall. These same colleagues had thrown him a baby shower only a few months before, and they had more recently welcomed him back from paternity leave. Farook sat for a few minutes. Some 80 other colleagues had arrived. There was a Christmas tree. All the tables were decorated. The luncheon was about to begin when he abruptly left the hall, puzzling an office cubicle mate. Farook reappeared about a half-hour later with the Pakistani woman he had originally met through an online Muslim matrimonial site he joined in August 2013. He had subsequently married her at the Black Stone in the center of the Grand Mosque in Mecca. He settled with her back home in San Bernardino County, and there had been a nice wedding party at the local Islamic center. More than one person would speak of them as having lived the American dream on a good salary in a comfy apartment. That all turned to an absolute nightmare as the couple materialized in the hall’s entrance, both clad in black tactical outfits, both holding .223 caliber assault rifles. They proceeded to fire between 65 and 75 rounds into the holiday crowd of people who had on another day helped celebrate their child’s impending arrival into the world. After killing 14 and wounding 19, the couple withdrew to what would initially be described only as a dark-colored SUV and drove away with a lack of haste that surprised one witness. They left behind an explosive device that Farook might well have used part of his paternity leave to construct, building a bomb when he was supposed to be forging a bond with his child. The detonator was reportedly fashioned with a remote-control toy, as suggested by al Qaeda’s online magazine, Inspire, and likely used in the Boston Marathon bombs. The toy that Farook and Malik had chosen for their particular bomb was a yellow sports car. In this instance, the plan was apparently not only to kill more of Farook’s co-workers but also any number of the cops who raced to the scene and dashed fearlessly into the hall. Fortunately, the device failed to go off. One police expert suggested that there might have been some kind of electronic interference or that the couple may have been too far away when they tried to detonate it. The more likely explanation is that the hall’s sprinkler system had been triggered, apparently by one of the couple’s bullets. The resulting deluge almost certainly surprised the killers. It also might have soaked the remote control electronics. Among the officers who otherwise might have been killed was Lt. Mike Madden, one of the first four to arrive. A lesson of the Columbine massacre was that the police need to go in right away to prevent anybody else from being hurt. Madden reasoned when he entered the conference center that he had arrived just moments after the shooting. “There was the smell of gunpowder in the air,” he would later say at a press conference. He saw people who were beyond saving. “Victims who were obviously deceased,” he later said. “Unspeakable carnage.” He saw the total panic in the faces of the living. He heard people who were in desperate need of aid. “The moans and cries,” he recalled. “It was very loud.” Water was spraying from the sprinklers overhead and fire alarms were sounding, and everywhere the eyes went they beheld what should have never been. “What you’re seeing, what you’re hearing, what you’re smelling,” Madden remembered. “Surreal.” Some 50 survivors were huddled on the far side of the room, too terrorized to budge when the officers called to them. “We had to tell them to come to us, come to us,” Madden would report. One of the survivors came, and then they all came. There was no way of knowing if the killers were still in the building. A cellphone video recorded a cop—apparently a San Bernardino sheriff’s deputy—escorting some of the survivors to safety. His words are worth remembering the next time somebody condemns the police in general. “Try to relax, everybody, try to relax,” he told them. “I’ll take a bullet before you do, that’s for damn sure.” Not on the video was a witness who reported something that one of the responding cops immediately put over the radio. The cop relayed that the witness had been sitting next to a fellow county worker who had been “acting a little weird” and then suddenly left the hall. “Thirty minutes later, the shooting happens,” the cop said. The cop gave the name provided by the witness. “Syed Farook.” Another cop radioed that a follow-up on the tip had begun with the basics. “That Syed guy’s name and date of birth…” A third cop recalled aloud that one of the detectives had been “working up that name for something last week.” “I’ll have to check,” he said. Somebody else reported that the LAPD may have made a recent inquiry about Farook. The San Bernardino police now quickly determined two possible residences for Farook and set up surveillance on both. One of the teams radioed a report concerning a vehicle that passed one of the addresses. “Soft going by location.” That meant slow, as if the driver were cautiously checking to see if the coast was clear. “Black SUV, Utah plates, late model, probably 2014, front windows not tinted,” the cops on the scene further reported. The police had by then determined that Farook had rented a black SUV such as had been reported leaving the killing scene, such as was now proceeding away from the residence. The police followed. The black SUV suddenly accelerated from soft to careening. “East at a high rate of speed,” a cop reported. “We are in pursuit of the suspect vehicle. We have shots fired out the back window.” The cops’ voices on the radio remained remarkable even as shots could be clearly heard in the background. “Multiple shots fired,” a cop reported. Also in the background were the sirens of ever more cops racing toward the most mortal danger. An officer was hit, apparently by a ricochet, but the wound was not serious. The danger remained. “We have the suspect vehicle stopped,” a cop announced. “We need a Bearcat!” A Bearcat being an armored car. Three responded, but the shooting was done. The occupants of the car had fired 76 rifle rounds at the police. A total of 23 officers had fired 380 rounds in response. “We have one down outside the car,” a cop reported “One down inside the car.” The SUV’s emergency lights were on and kept flashing. The windshield wipers periodically worked in the rainless afternoon. A body could be seen sprawled in the street, a rifle nearby. Another body was in the back. There was also a second rifle, along with two 9 mm handguns, 1,400 more rounds of .223 ammunition, and 200 rounds of 9 mm ammunition. Another 2,500 rifle rounds and 2,000 pistol rounds were discovered when police armed with a search warrant went through the house where the couple who seemed to be living the American dream had been concocting a nightmare. The couple had not been bent on suicide. They had done everything they could to get away after the killings, and there is no way of knowing what else they may have been plotting. There have been reports that they were in touch with Islamist extremists, and perhaps that is what prompted the LAPD to have taken an interest in Farook. Part of the reason for leaving the bomb in the conference center may have been the hope it would aid their escape. Police now found in their home a dozen more pipe bombs, which, like the one at the murder scene, were identical to those that al Qaeda’s magazine depicted, along with step–by-step instructions on “How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.” Only, Malik was a mom. And Farook was a dad. The thought of their 6-month-old daughter brought cause for thanks that mom and dad did not collect her from grandma and have her in the car with them when they encountered the police. Along with Johnson’s Head-to-Toe Baby Wash and Pampers Swaddlers Diapers, the mom’s baby registry with Target (“Tashfeen’s Baby Registry”) lists an Evenflo Tribute Convertible Car Seat. That would suggest some awareness of child safety, but there seems next to no chance the couple would have refrained from firing at pursuing officers out of concern for their daughter. And the police who were being fired upon would have had no way of knowing there was a tiny child behind those tinted windows in the back. Nobody would have felt worse than the cops if the child had come to harm. The child survived, the absolutely innocent beginning and end to her mom and dad’s diabolical plot. Other plots have reminded us that we are at war. This one tells us that we are in a war like no other, a war in which a couple drops their baby with grandma, then goes to a holiday party to murder co-workers who not long ago threw them a baby shower. A shudder accompanies the question of whether the murdered included anybody who bought one of the items on Tashfeen’s Baby Registry.

By KYLE CHENEY 03/02/2016 04:06 PM EST Updated 03/02/2016 08:09 PM EST Ben Carson never seemed sure how to corral competing personalities. | Getty The architects of Ben Carson’s presidential campaign turned out to be its demolitionists, too. The retired neurosurgeon exploded onto the political stage last fall with a hopeful conservative message and a promise to restore honor to the White House as only an outsider could. He exited the race Wednesday after barely registering in 15 primary contests and presiding over a hollowed-out, underfunded campaign. But Carson’s fate was sealed months earlier by his failure to constrain the self-destructive impulses of an unwieldy and free-spending team. Carson said Wednesday that Super Tuesday’s election results left him with no “political path forward.” He said he will formally address his political future during a speech Friday, but he left no doubt that his quest for the Republican nomination was coming to an end. The premise of Carson’s candidacy, as he often described it, was his ability to build teams to tackle complex issues, as he did for 30 years in a Johns Hopkins operating room. If he could coordinate dozens of experts to execute life-saving surgeries, he could do the same in the Situation Room or for the economy, he posited. His top aides were convinced they could model their effort on President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, a gold standard for insurgent candidates. Yet time after time, his own campaign team seemed to undercut the premise — and Carson himself never seemed sure how to corral competing personalities. Throughout 2015, Carson's campaign was exposed as a jumble of equally influential aides who agreed only on their distrust of one another. There was Terry Giles, who helped launch the campaign in the spring but departed acrimoniously in June. His departure opened the way to Barry Bennett and communications director Doug Watts, veteran political operatives who resigned on New Year's Eve. There was Dean Parker, the national finance chairman whose spending decisions led to his resignation in January. The campaign finally seemed to stabilize that month under Robert Dees, the controversial ex-general who took the reins, along with senior strategist Ed Brookover, after Bennett and Watts resigned. By NICK GASS All of them, though, played second fiddle to Armstrong Williams, the conservative media maven whose voice seemed to ring a little louder in Carson's ears than the others — and whose unilateral decision making aided Carson's unlikely rise but also led to devastating strategic blunders that contributed to the campaign's demise. Williams' disproportionate influence led to battles with other campaign leaders over press strategy, spending priorities and policy. The aides even clashed over the manner of Carson’s announcement for president, in what many in Carson’s orbit now say was the first sign of the internal strife that helped sink the campaign. Undetected symptoms The day before the scheduled announcement on May 4, Bennett and Watts said in a joint interview, the campaign was in Detroit rehearsing. Reporters had been summoned to the city, Carson's childhood home, for an elaborate and expensive kickoff. But the night before the launch, a prerecorded video of Carson — taped at his Florida home — aired on Sinclair Broadcasting TV stations, preempting the official kickoff. Bennett and Watts said they had no idea it was coming until reporters starting asking about it — but they quickly discerned that Williams had scooped their own announcement. ""That was Day One,"" Watts lamented. Williams confirmed the episode, describing his ""long-lasting relationship"" with Sinclair, the company that sold Williams his own TV stations. ""If Dr. Carson is having an announcement in Detroit, everyone with common sense knows he’s going to announce running for president. So I played favorite with someone that has been with us from the beginning,"" he said. There were more signs of trouble in June, when Giles abruptly left the campaign. The affable Texan, who befriended Carson in 1994 when the two were inducted into the Horatio Alger Association, was considered a shoo-in to manage Carson's campaign in the spring. He helped build the original campaign team that included Bennett, a longtime ally of Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, and Watts, a veteran of Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign. But Giles' wife, Kalli O'Malley, an outspoken participant in campaign meetings and vocal supporter of same-sex marriage, bristled at some of Carson's comments on gay rights — such as his comparison of homosexuality to bestiality and suggestion that prison can turn men gay. Giles departed to run a pair of pro-Carson super PACs, but he said the decision to leave ""was made a bit easier given Kalli's concerns about gay rights issues and same-sex marriage. She is a strong conservative and a staunch supporter of equal rights for all individuals. It is one of the many reasons I respect and love her."" 2016 By ELI STOKOLS Giles now expresses disdain for the men he hired, arguing that their antics rotted the campaign from the inside. He said staffing decisions after he left ostracized Carson's true loyalists in favor of professional consultants who didn't understand the candidate's uniqueness. His topmost complaint: Campaign leaders ignored his urgent plea to have Carson roll out nuanced policy plans over the summer. ""It has been you that fired or boxed out real policy people, hired pretenders, and then took a position that Ben didn’t have to prepare or get 'into the weeds' on issues since he was polling so well,"" Giles wrote in a scorching email to the campaign's top leadership on Dec. 22, obtained by POLITICO. ""It has been you that ignored the strategy to have Ben give his major policy speeches back in August and September so that by now he would be well prepared."" Bennett called Giles a ""delightful man"" but said he lacked ""political instincts."" He pointed to Giles' decision to pay tens of thousands of dollars to a Texas-based consultant, One Fast Buffalo, to design a campaign logo that was never used. The climb and the fall Any divisions that existed went largely unnoticed over the summer. At that time, Carson was still a low-key presence on the campaign trail. But he was quietly building a fundraising juggernaut that raked in small donations and helped him surge to the front of a suddenly crammed Republican field. As Donald Trump seemed to capture the anger of a restive Republican base, Carson offered evangelical voters a more subdued, godly message — an image he reinforced with tales of his improbable rise from poverty in Detroit and his spiritual redemption after violent outbursts as a teenager. Carson also had a penchant for delivering incendiary statements at a low volume. In September he said that a Muslim shouldn't be president and suggested German Jews might have fared better against the Nazis if they had had guns. He argued that victims of a mass shooting in Oregon should have rushed the killer, and he defended it by recalling his own run-in with a gunman at a Baltimore Popeye's in the 1980s, an account that police couldn't verify. Each comment stirred controversy yet seemed to deepen his support among conservatives. He began a steady climb in polls, eventually taking a national lead and passing Trump in all-important Iowa. That's when sustained, public turbulence hit for the first time. A series of news reports in early November questioned Carson's personal narrative, whether he truly had violent tendencies as a teenager; whether he'd really been dubbed the ""most honest"" student at Yale by a professor; whether he'd ever received a formal scholarship offer from West Point, as he claimed in his 1991 book, ""Gifted Hands."" In a defiant news conference, Carson ripped reporters for scrutinizing his life story, and his campaign claimed fundraising had surged amid the media attention. Then, with the campaign feeling bullish about its prospects, terrorists struck in Paris. 2016 By DANIEL LIPPMAN Suddenly, the Republican presidential conversation became singularly focused on national security, and the doctor appeared out of his depth. Carson struggled to articulate his foreign policy views in interviews. Even his own adviser said he appeared to struggle with the substance in an embarrassing New York Times interview arranged by Williams. Suddenly, the campaign's fundraising —which led the Republican field for most of 2016 — cratered and Carson tumbled out of first place in the polls, beginning a downward trajectory that culminated in Wednesday's withdrawal. Carson appeared to find his voice on foreign policy in January, and his team helmed by Dees seemed to stabilize in the new year. But it was too late. Carson finished fourth or worse in the first 15 primary contests before he decided to quit. Shortly before he pulled out of the race, Carson told an audience of students in Orangeburg, South Carolina, that he’d make one big change if he could start over. “I regret a lot of the inflammatory language that I’ve used,” he said. The Williams factor Williams has argued that Carson's campaign team — the iteration helmed by Bennett and Watts — has tried to scapegoat him for the campaign's dysfunction. Rather, he said, the national dialogue seemed to conspire against Carson. “If Donald Trump was not in the race, it could be a different scenario, but when you have someone like a Trump who sounds like an authoritarian — people just want to know that in times of fear and uncertainty that they have strength. Unfortunately, Dr. Carson’s soft-spokenness, where he did not rise to the level of a [Ted] Cruz and Trump, people interpreted in a way that they decided to take a look at another candidate. They could blame me; I could blame them. I’m not going to do that.” It was no accident that Williams exercised outsize influence on Carson. The two met 25 years ago over a shared interest in the pitched 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas. Williams says he can't remember precisely how they first connected, but it coincided with Carson's skyrocketing fame for his groundbreaking separation of German conjoined twins. A friendship blossomed. The Williams and Carson families visited each other's homes and vacationed together. All three of the Carson sons lived or worked with Williams — and in 2007, when Williams went to Alaska for a one-hour interview with then-Gov. Sarah Palin, two Carson sons went along as producers. Eventually, Williams said, he began to help the Carsons on real estate and ""how to make his money grow."" He advised on home renovations and, more recently, helped Carson oversee business matters related to his books. Because of this closeness, Williams said, it's tempting to ascribe the campaign's failings to him. But he insists his role has been overstated, that he largely facilitated Carson's media appearances. ""I’ve never seen the headquarters. I’ve never been there. I may have met only 12 or 15 people of the 125 they had on payroll,"" he said. But he also acknowledged being a driving force early in the campaign. He helped assemble the first team meeting at Giles' Houston home. ""Dr. Carson and I are friends first,"" Williams said. ""I have never told Dr. Carson an untruth ... To build trust takes a lot of time. Dr. Carson knows many people. There are very few that he’ll ever trust. That’s just his personality."" Asked whether he believes he served Carson well, Williams said, ""I don’t have regrets. I just think we’re a band of brothers and sisters that came together for an incredible moment … Some of us began to believe that he could take that all the way to the White House. What we saw was just a Pyrrhic victory at the time."" The Obama model Carson's withdrawal from the race brought to an unceremonious end a campaign that was built, at the outset, to resemble the effort of the man Carson hoped to succeed: Obama. ""I became a student of the Obama effort in 2007. I followed it religiously,"" said Watts, the former communications director, who along with Bennett helped build the campaign's infrastructure last summer. ""We all read all the books about the Obama campaign,"" added Bennett, who said mirroring that campaign's emphasis on ""engagement"" helped them build a 5 million-strong Facebook following and a devoted army of small donors. But Obama's campaign also minimized internal drama, they noted, avoiding the sniping and crosscurrents that became Carson's undoing. It's that lingering aftertaste that still sticks with the campaign's former inner circle: They had a chance, and they blew it. ""Ben likes to say that God will dictate this race,"" Giles wrote in his email to the campaign, ""Well, we now know what God does to a campaign when Ben is surrounded with ungodly men.""

255,http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/apple-is-right-the-fbi-wants-to-break-into-lots-of-phones/470607/,"After Apple’s lawyers revealed that the agency is trying to gain access to about a dozen devices, it’s becoming increasingly clear why the government chose to take the San Bernardino case public. James Comey, the director of the FBI, has insisted that his agency’s ongoing conflict with Apple over a terrorist’s phone is just that: a conflict over one phone. In a letter posted to the Lawfare blog over the weekend, Comey called the legal issue at hand “quite narrow,” and said the FBI sought only “limited” help. Experts say the small scope of the FBI’s ask bolsters its case. But in fact, the iPhone 5c that belonged to Syed Farook—one of the perpetrators of December’s mass shooting in San Bernadino, California—is only one of at least a dozen of Apple devices the FBI is seeking to access, according to court documents unsealed Tuesday. In a letter addressed to a federal judge in New York, a lawyer for Apple said that federal law enforcement has recently requested that the company access information on 12 other iOS devices. The list is likely not a complete tally of the FBI’s requests, and does not include similar requests from state or local police. The letter was sent last week, just one day after a federal judge in California asked Apple to help the FBI unlock Farook’s iPhone. It was filed under seal but was released on Tuesday. The letter was submitted to a federal court in Brooklyn, where Apple and the FBI are facing off in a less dramatic version of the San Bernardino legal fight. In the Brooklyn case, the FBI is asking Apple to extract data from a locked iPhone with an outdated operating system. In San Bernardino, the FBI is asking Apple to modify the software in a newer iPhone in order to make it easier for agents to try to break in. Apple can technically fulfill both requests, but it has chosen to oppose them. All 12 requests outlined in the letter were made under the All Writs Act, a 1789 law which has been used to compel a landline phone service provider to help the FBI conduct phone taps. But the judge in the Brooklyn case has expressed doubt that the same law would apply to locked iPhones. Here’s why this all matters: These 12 pending requests—and probably many more that didn’t make the list—are a logjam waiting to break. If the federal judge in the San Bernardino case sides with the FBI, it would be much easier for the judges overseeing these other, similar cases to compel Apple to comply. Apple maintains that this case is not, in fact, about just one phone; it’s about precedent. And if it can show that the government is using the San Bernardino case as a way to break through at least a dozen stalled cases elsewhere (even as the FBI claims that it’s not interested in setting a precedent), the judge might think twice before granting the FBI’s wishes. Meanwhile, there are a whole lot more devices waiting in the wings, in the hands of state and local law enforcement. The Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. says he’s asked Apple to unlock a whopping 175 iPhones. If the government wins in San Bernardino, Vance told PBS’s Charlie Rose recently, he would “absolutely” try to get Apple to help get data off those devices, too. It’s likely the government chose to take the San Bernardino case public, instead of one of the other pending cases, because it can make a very strong argument for needing to get into a terrorist’s iPhone. Comey wrote compellingly in his recent open letter that the FBI is duty-bound to pursue every lead in a national-security investigation. Here, Apple is forced to take a position that obstructs a crucial-seeming probe, in contrast to the other cases, which did not involve terrorism charges, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The FBI may be winning the public-relations battle it’s fighting with Apple alongside the ongoing legal conflicts. According to a poll that Pew Research conducted over the weekend, most Americans think Apple should honor the FBI’s request to unlock Farook’s iPhone. But now, Apple has a new arrow in its quiver: It can show that helping the FBI in California will have far-reaching consequences.",2016-02-12 19:52:04,Apple Is Right: The FBI Wants to Break Into Lots of Phones,,1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

MarShawn McCarrel, who was only 23 years old, shot himself in front of the capitol building at around 6 p.m. Monday night. His death has no known witnesses, but police quickly arrived at the scene and found his body, The Columbus Dispatch reported. Just last Friday, McCarrel had attended the NAACP Image Awards for his work with Pursuing Our Dreams, a mentorship group he founded. McCarrel also launched a “Feed the Streets” campaign to help Columbus’s homeless population, and he helped organize protests in Ohio following the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. McCarrel’s final tweet, made just hours before his death, shows a certain gallows humor in retrospect: Let the record show that I pissed on the state house before i left. — SPICY (@MC_CARREL11) February 8, 2016  He made other cryptic remarks on Twitter, such as “If we don’t have to live through hell just to get to heaven.

These are some of the trending stories today: Teens arrested in Seattle homeless shooting: Three teenage suspects have been arrested in connection with the deadly shooting last week in the homeless encampment known as The Jungle, Seattle police said. The suspects are 13, 16 and 17 years old. Police recovered a handgun during the arrests. (Seattle Times) Cosby case in court: Will the criminal sexual-assault charges against Bill Cosby ever go to trial?  A hint may come today in a courthouse in Montgomery County, Pa., outside Philadelphia. Assuming no delay, Cosby faces his first hearing on criminal charges that he hopes to persuade a judge to dismiss. Some legal analysts say Cosby may succeed. ""I feel that, unfortunately, the current prosecutor has overstepped his bounds,"" says New York lawyer Jerry Reisman, who's been following the case. ""Unless they can find some new circumstance, such as fraud, I feel that the case should be dismissed."" If that happens, he says, the likelihood of Cosby being tried in this case is probably nil. The actor-comedian, 78, is charged with felony aggravated indecent assault and accused of drugging and sexually assaulting ex-Temple University employee Andrea Constand at his Montgomery County home in 2004.

The company, which is still grappling with the huge costs from the deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, said it would cut 7,000 jobs by 2017, nearly 9 percent of its workforce. BP shares fell on the news, dropping by around 7 percent in London to lead losers on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index.

Its better-than-expected earnings sent the company's stock up more than 8%, to $813, in after-hours trading immediately after the release of its fourth-quarter and full-year results. At that price, Alphabet's market capitalization would be roughly $559 billion, topping that of Apple, which closed the day with a market cap of $534.7 billion.

The villagers had little time to get to high ground. The epicenter of the magnitude 9.2 quake, which shook Alaska for four and a half minutes, was about 56 miles away. Deadly waves hit Chenega four minutes later. (Associated Press) Doggone good news Marietta cop could keep K-9: A retired Marietta police K-9 officer might get to keep his dog after all. City officials said at a news conference on Monday that former K-9 Officer Matthew Hickey, 57, could be made an unpaid ""auxiliary officer"" with the department and keep 5-year-old Ajax even in his retirement. Just last week, however, Marietta city officials had said that state law required them to put the dog up for auction because it's still government property. Hickey hoped to take Ajax with him when he retired in late January after 30 years as a police officer. He said city officials told him he would need to buy the dog, which he raised and trained. He said he came up with $3,500 (what a local police dog trainer told the city that Ajax was worth), but police Chief Robert Hupp wouldn't accept the offer. Hupp and other city officials said that because Ajax is still healthy and young, Ohio law mandates that the dog be sold through a sealed-bid auction. Ohio law does allow cities to sell police dogs to the dog's K-9 officer for $1, but only if the dog can't work any longer. After news broke of Ajax' possible sale, Hickey received an outpouring of support on social media. An online campaign had raised $65,000 for Hickey as of Monday afternoon.

	Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Apple filed a motion Thursday requesting that a federal court vacate an order to compel the tech giant to hack into an iPhone of a suspected terrorist, arguing that the “unprecedented” move violates the U.S. Constitution. Apple has already publicly said that it would not comply with a judge’s order that it assist FBI investigators in accessing data on an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last December, which left 14 people dead. In the 65-page filing, Apple said the order would compel it to create a “back door” into the iPhone, which would threaten civil liberties, and said there is no legal basis for the government to make the request.  “(T)he unprecedented order requested by the government finds no support in the law and would violate the Constitution,” Apple said in its motion. “Such an order would inflict significant harm — to civil liberties, society and national security — and would preempt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the president.”  Specifically, Apple cited the Constitution’s First Amendment, saying the order to force it to write security-circumventing software “amounts to compelled speech and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment.” In addition, the company said, the order runs counter to the Fourth Amendment, prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures, and the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. The Department of Justice has said that the order is specific to this case. But Apple said if it were forced to comply with the order, it would set a dangerous precedent. “The government says: ‘Just this once’ and ‘Just this phone,'” Apple said. “Despite the context of this particular action, no legal principle would limit the use of this technology to domestic terrorism cases — but even if such limitations could be imposed, it would only drive our adversaries further underground, using encryption technology made by foreign companies that cannot be conscripted into U.S.” Apple said the U.S. government had “the opportunity to seek amendments to existing law, to ask Congress to adopt the position it urges here.” But instead, it turned to the courts, “a forum ill-suited to address the myriad competing interests, potential ramifications and unintended consequences presented by the government’s unprecedented demand,” the company said. CEO Tim Cook, who posted an open letter last week outlining the company’s position, said in an interview Wednesday with ABC News that creating software to bypass the iPhone’s security measures is something “we view as sort of the equivalent of cancer.” “We think it’s bad news to write,” he said. “We would never write it; we have never written it.” Apple’s stance has been backed by other top Silicon Valley execs, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google chief Sundar Pichai.

261,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/01/apple-fbi-encryption-fight-security-experts-rsa,"As digital privacy issues erupt worldwide, experts gathering in San Francisco are united that the government should not influence security technology Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 20.54 BST Efforts by the US government to compromise the security of technology companies such as Apple are “misguided”, a precursor to “tyranny” and “a path to hell”, according to computer security experts gathered in San Francisco this week. The consensus at the RSA conference, where luminaries from the security community are gathered, is that Washington will have a hard time convincing Silicon Valley engineers to invent a technical solution to resolve the standoff between Apple and the FBI.  The judge has ordered the company to help the FBI bypass the passcode on an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino killers, but many in the tech community simply don’t think a compromise is tenable. Yet US attorney general Loretta Lynch told the same audience on 1 March that technology companies are threatening to break the country’s “social compact” if they don’t cooperate with authorities. “Do we let one company, no matter how great the company, no matter how beautiful their devices, decide this issue for all of us?” she said. The case is only the latest chapter in a global debate over digital privacy. On 1 March alone, governments on three continents showed they were willing to battle technology companies publicly over privacy technology. In the US, lawmakers questioned Apple’s top lawyer over how it could better work with federal investigators. In Brazil, police arrested a Facebook executive after the company said it couldn’t supply information from its Whatsapp messaging app. In London, the government released legislation that would give the government more authority to hack into smartphones and computers.But technology companies, as demonstrated at RSA, aren’t backing down either. “The path to hell starts with the backdoor,” said Microsoft’s general counsel, Brad Smith. Backdoor refers to a guaranteed way to access otherwise private communications. Smith challenged the crowd to “stand up with Apple in this important case” and said that he hoped there could be a compromise in technology, but didn’t say what it could be. Amit Yoran is president of the RSA, a company that pioneered much of modern encryption and hosts of this week’s conference. “Some of their policy proposals, like weakening encryption, are so misguided as to boggle the mind,” he said. The computer security community has a long and complicated relationship with surveillance authorities. For decades, both sides worked together on solving some of the complicated math behind encryption technology. But there was always tension in how such technology was used. Three letter agencies wanted it for the state but feared widespread use of encryption could hamper intelligence collection. Technologists, who tend towards libertarianism, wanted to hamper intelligence collection. “In a tyranny, you build mechanisms to deny people opportunities to take control of their actions,” said encryption expert Whitfield Diffie. Moxie Marlinspike, a San Francisco developer who makes encryption messaging apps including Signal, said plainly: “Law enforcement is supposed to be difficult.” Some regulators say they want to reach a compromise with technology companies. “I support encryption,” Lynch said on stage. But her presentation here was at times awkward, as she made clear how far of a divide there is between government and industry on the issue. “The middle ground is to divulge what the law requires.” Lynch’s Justice Department currently is fighting Apple in a federal court over the company has to weaken an iPhone’s security controls to make it easier for investigators to guess the passcode, which Apple doesn’t have. The device was the work phone of Syed Farook, the gunman in the mass shooting in San Bernardino on 2 December 2015. On 29 February, a federal judge in another case ruled Apple didn’t have to to assist the Justice Department in harvesting data from a phone involved in a criminal investigation. Lynch said she was disappointed in the ruling and that her agency would be resubmitting its application for a search warrant.",2016-03-01 20:32:37,Security experts: FBI asking Apple to weaken encryption is 'path to hell',,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

263,http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/17/tim-cook-apple-wont-create-backdoor-to-unlock-san-bernardino-attackers-iphone,"Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that the company will appeal a California judge’s order to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the terrorists involved in the San Bernardino shooting. Following the request, Cook argued, would “threaten the security of our customers.” The device in question — an iPhone 5c — was in the possession of Syed Farook, who, alongside his wife, carried out a mass shooting during a training event at the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, where he worked, last December. The phone was owned by the agency and assigned to Farook. He and his wife were later killed by police in a shootout. Authorities want access to data on the phone and are seeking Apple’s help to crack the passcode (PDF) by creating software which, when loaded onto the device, would circumvent the security system. That’s because, beyond the passcode itself, Apple’s security measures include an ‘auto-erase function’ which, if activated by a user, will erase all data on a device if the passcode is entered incorrectly 10 times. In a letter to Apple customers, Cook said Apple has provided “data that’s in our possession” but it will not develop a “backdoor” for its software: We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone. Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software — which does not exist today — would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession. The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control. Cook also criticized authorities for using the All Writs Act and not Congressional legislation to make the request, which he labeled “a dangerous precedent” that would seriously weaken Apple’s security system: The government would have us remove security features and add new capabilities to the operating system, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock an iPhone by “brute force,” trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer. The implications of the government’s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone’s device to capture their data. The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone’s microphone or camera without your knowledge. There’s been plenty of comment over whether, in making this ruling, the FBI is essentially asking Apple to create a backdoor solution that it can use in similar cases. Opinion is divided, however. Techdirt argues that the ultimate goal of the order is a backdoor, while research organization Errata Security claims that’s an overly active interpretation of the ruling. What is for certain is that the case once again throws down the tension between security user data and providing information to assist authorities. Cook has been forthright in his belief that products and services must be encrypted. In a speech at EPIC’s Champions of Freedom event in Washington last June, the Apple CEO said: There’s another attack on our civil liberties that we see heating up every day — it’s the battle over encryption. Some in Washington are hoping to undermine the ability of ordinary citizens to encrypt their data. We think this is incredibly dangerous. We’ve been offering encryption tools in our products for years, and we’re going to stay on that path. We think it’s a critical feature for our customers who want to keep their data secure. For years we’ve offered encryption services like iMessage and FaceTime because we believe the contents of your text messages and your video chats is none of our business. This latest news illustrates the important role that technology companies play as the gatekeeper of information in cases of national security and legal proceedings. Update: The EFF has now said it will be supporting Apple’s appeal against the court order by submitting an amicus brief. “We are supporting Apple here because the government is doing more than simply asking for Apple’s assistance,” writes the EFF’s Kurt Opsahl today. “For the first time, the government is requesting Apple write brand new code that eliminates key features of iPhone security — security features that protect us all. Essentially, the government is asking Apple to create a master key so that it can open a single phone. And once that master key is created, we’re certain that our government will ask for it again and again, for other phones, and turn this power against any software or device that has the audacity to offer strong security.” Turning to the question of technical feasibility, security blog Trail of Bits’ Dan Guido has suggested that in his opinion Apple could comply with the court order to provide access to a specific iPhone 5c. “I believe it is technically feasible for Apple to comply with all of the FBI’s requests in this case. On the iPhone 5C, the passcode delay and device erasure are implemented in software and Apple can add support for peripheral devices that facilitate PIN code entry. In order to limit the risk of abuse, Apple can lock the customized version of iOS to only work on the specific recovered iPhone and perform all recovery on their own, without sharing the firmware image with the FBI,” he writes. However Guido’s suggestion that a backdoor could be created for the specific iPhone 5c in the case has been refuted by former Apple employee John Kelley, who spent four years working as an embedded security engineer at Cupertino. In a series of tweets earlier today discussing the issue Kelley makes the point that Apple could in fact also be forced to modify its Secure Enclave firmware — thereby backdooring the hardware security feature (i.e. the Secure Enclave) which more modern iPhones have but which the iPhone 5c in this case lacks. @AriX Not true, if Apple can be forced to modify iOS, they can be forced to modify SEP firmware as well. @trailofbits has SEP details wrong — John Kelley (@JohnHedge) February 17, 2016  @AriX I have no clue where they got the idea that changing SPE firmware will destroy keys. SPE FW is just a signed blob on iOS System Part — John Kelley (@JohnHedge) February 17, 2016  So the suggestion is that Apple is indeed correct when it says that a government request to backdoor security in the case of a single iPhone comes with “no guarantee” that such moves could be limited to just one iPhone. Because, if Kelley’s take is correct, there is no technical blocker — at a firmware level — to prevent Apple being forced to build a backdoor into even more modern iPhones, which do have its hardware Touch ID security feature. Hence the necessity of a principled defense in the face of government agencies trying to use the law to brute force Apple to hack its own security systems.

264,http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/donald-trump-gop-debate-mental-health/413023/,"The presidential candidate’s views on mental health and gun violence aren’t uncommon, but they’re based on two big myths. Donald Trump has done it again. At the third Republican presidential debate Wednesday night, Trump managed to once more offend a large swath of people in one breath. “I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that’s target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill,” he told CNBC moderators. “They look around for gun-free zones.” Trump isn’t alone in this belief. In a Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week, 63 percent of participants—and 82 percent of Republicans—said mass shootings reflect problems in identifying and treating people with mental-health problems, while just 23 percent said they reflected inadequate gun-control laws. But mental-health advocates, individuals who suffer from mental-health issues, and the people who support them likely bristled at his remarks. In the United States, one in four adults, or approximately 61.5 million Americans, experiences some form of mental illness in a given year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, a nonprofit advocacy group. The mental-health community has long tried to rid the lexicon of language that, while once common, it now considers a driver of stigma against mental illness. She’s psycho. He’s gone mad. They’re sick in the head. A politician more concerned with public perception probably wouldn’t have used the term “sickos.” In fact, if anyone other than Trump had said it, there’s a good chance it would have been deemed a gaffe. Decades of study and research into the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders has rooted out such terminology and generated more clinical, precise terms. Some of the new nomenclature spread into the public discourse and changed the way Americans speak. As my colleague Cari Romm wrote yesterday, “Words like mad have been used to mean insanity or dementia since the 1500s, but over the past couple centuries, it’s been used more as a general descriptor of a concept or personality than an indicator of mental illness”—a la March Madness. But there’s much more to Trump’s remarks than the question of the “right” or “wrong” language. Trump’s claim that “they”—the sickos— specifically target areas that prohibit guns in order to carry out shootings is a common talking point among many Republicans and gun advocates. Mental-health reform, not gun reform, they say, is the way to solve America’s growing mass shooting crisis. Trump’s claim also seems to rest on two big myths: that mental illness causes violence or crime, and that the presence of mental health can predict violence. It has become standard practice to raise the question of the link between mental health and violence after a mass shooting. This makes sense: Few people can fathom a stable, sane individual committing such a horrid crime. “No matter what you do, guns, no guns, it doesn’t matter,” Trump said in August. “You have people that are mentally ill and they’re going to come through the cracks and they’re going to do things that people will not even believe are possible.” Indeed, many mass shooters, most of whom are young men, are later determined to have exhibited signs of mental disorders. But extensive research has shown that only about 4 percent of violence in the U.S. can be attributed to people diagnosed with mental illness. Trump’s remarks suggest mental illness is the sole cause of violent acts, and not one factor among many. As with most things, context is important. As Mother Jones’ Mark Follman recently wrote in an exploration of how “to stop the next mass shooter”: Legions of young men love violent movies or first-person shooter games, get angry about school, jobs, or relationships, and suffer from mental health afflictions. The number who seek to commit mass murder is tiny. ... That's why sizing up a suspect's current circumstances is crucial: Did he recently get fired from a job? Did he lose his kids in a nasty custody battle? Is he failing out of school or abusing drugs?” The biggest risk factors for mass shootings—“basically, being an angry young man,” as New York magazine’s Jesse Singal puts it—are so widespread in the general population that it’s nearly impossible for anyone—psychiatrists, cops, parents—to predict whether someone will actually commit a mass shooting. The reality of the connection between mental illness and violence is very different from the one delivered by Trump. People with severe mental illnesses are over 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than members of the general population, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Research has shown that people with a mental-illness diagnosis are more likely to be discriminated against within the justice system, and are more likely to become incarcerated than healthy people, according to the Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. In 2005, more than half of all prison and jail inmates in the United States had “a mental-health problem,” according to the Department of Justice. “In this sense,” wrote doctors Jonathan Metzl and Kenneth MacLeish in an American Public Health Association paper on mental illness and mass shootings in February, “persons with mental illness might well have more to fear from ‘us’ than we do from ‘them.’ And blaming persons with mental disorders for gun crime overlooks the threats posed to society by a much larger population—the sane.”",2016-02-19 07:17:36,"Donald Trump on Mental Health, Gun Violence, and 'The Sickos'",,1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

The shooting happened at 10:24 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 20, when, police say, Jason Brian Dalton, 45, of Cooper Township, approached a Chevrolet Cruze and an Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan in the parking lot of Cracker Barrel, 5581 Cracker Barrel Blvd., in Texas Township. Dalton allegedly shot all four occupants of the Chevrolet Cruze, and the driver of the Oldsmobile, who was the single occupant of the van. The victims in the Chevrolet Cruze are: Mary Jo Nye, 60, of Battle Creek, the driver; Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, of Battle Creek, the rear driver-side passenger; and Barbara Hawthorne, 68, of Battle Creek, the rear, passenger-side passenger. The driver of the minivan, Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, Mich., also was killed. A 14-year-old front-seat passenger of the Chevrolet is in critical condition at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo. She was pronounced dead until she squeezed her mother's hand, police have said. UPDATES: * Shooting victim Tyler Smith: 'He's such a great kid,' school leader says * 2 Kalamazoo shooting victims were sisters-in-law, friends, college roommates * High school senior from Mattawan killed in Kalamazoo mass shootings * Retired Battle Creek teacher among victims in Kalamazoo mass shooting * Kalamazoo mass shooting victim Dorothy Brown, 74: 'A sweet, sweet old lady' The shooting at Cracker Barrel was the last of three separate shootings Saturday, and police say Dalton is the suspect. At approximately 5:42 p.m. on Saturday, the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office was called to the Meadows Townhomes on G Avenue near Comstock for a woman who had been shot multiple times in the parking lot. The woman remained in serious condition at Borgess Medical Center Sunday morning. The Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department is leading the investigation into that shooting. The second shooting was reported at approximately 10:08 p.m. at the Seelye Ford Kia Dealership on Stadium Drive in Kalamazoo. Mattawan High School senior Tyler Smith, 17, and father, Richard Eugene Smith, 53, were killed. The Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety is leading the investigation into that shooting. Following the shooting at the Cracker Barrel Restaurant, Dalton was stopped at 12:40 a.m. at Ransom and Porter Streets in Kalamazoo and was taken into custody without further incident.  Police were acting on a BOL (Be On the Lookout) for a dark-colored Chevy HHR that was spotted by witnesses at the Stadium Drive and Cracker Barrel shootings. Dalton is believed to be the solo actor in these shootings and there is no further threat to public safety, police say. Emily Monacelli is a reporter for MLive.com.

The news media usually eager to jump all over stories about race and hate crimes, no matter how small, when a white person is the aggressor. For instance, The New York Times recently scoured the county looking for instances of “Islamophobia.” The paper found an instance were beer cans from drunken college students were being thrown at a mosque in Tucson, Arizona. At the time the NYT reported that “No one has been injured. But in light of the highly charged national debate about accepting Muslim refugees in the United States -- as well as the mass shooting by two Muslim terrorists in San Bernardino, Calif., in December -- tensions over the insults and vandalism here have run particularly high.” This reporting is in stark contrast to the lack of coverage being given to the hate crime committed against Sgt. Marques. The Sergeant was targeted for his complexion and was accused of being a racist for simply ignoring the people harassing him. He was then physically accosted and robbed all because of the color of his skin. Transcript below:  Fox News

Apple, says the Obama Administration, is siding with ""its business model and public brand marketing strategy"" ahead of public safety. That's not it, says Apple CEO Tim Cook. He says his company is ""a staunch advocate for our customers' privacy and personal safety."" Donald Trump has weighed in on the controversy, ad-libbing a call for a boycott of Apple products including the iPhone, the device at the center of the debate. Two weeks ago, a federal court ordered Apple to write code that would allow the FBI to unlock an iPhone used by one of the gunmen in the San Bernadino mass shooting. Apple refused, saying the code could be used to unlock other iPhones as well, not just the one covered by the order. A Wall Street Journal report that the feds are currently going after a dozen or so iPhones in other cases seems to back up Apple's argument. What this is really about -- but barely touched upon in corporate media -- is Edward Snowden. A few years ago, no one -- left, right, libertarian -- would have supported Apple's refusal to cooperate with a federal investigation of a terrorist attack associated with a radical Islamist group, much less its decision to fight a court order to do so. If investigators hadn't combed through the data on the phone used by Syed Farook before he slaughtered 14 people, it would have been seen as dereliction of duty. Obviously the authorities need to learn everything they can about Farook, such as whether he ever had direct communications with ISIS or if there were any coconspirators. Looking at evidence like that is what law enforcement is for. Rather than face Uncle Sam alone, Apple's defiance is being backed by Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo -- companies who suffered disastrous blows to their reputations, and billions of dollars in lost business, after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that they spent years voluntarily turning over their customers' data to the spy agency in its drive to ""hoover up"" every email, phone call, text message and video communication on the planet, including those of Americans. Most Americans tell pollsters Apple should play ball with the FBI. But Apple and its Silicon Valley allies aren't banking on the popular vote. Their biggest customers are disproportionately well-off and liberal -- and they don't want government spooks looking at their personal or business information. Another underreported aspect of this story is the same sort of interagency squabbling that contributed to the failure of counterterrorism officials to see the whole picture before 9/11, and was supposed to have been fixed by such Bush-era bureaucratic revamps as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and bringing America's 16 intelligence agencies under a single director. When you stop to think about this, it's insane. The NSA, specifically chartered to intercept signals intelligence that originates overseas -- that is specifically prohibited from gathering data that is sent from one American to another American -- continues to do so, probably at an even greater degree of efficiency than the period between 2009 and 2013, the era documented by the Snowden revelations leaked to the news media. Ignoring the anger of the American people, Congress did nothing to rein in the NSA. So they continue to break the law, and violate our privacy, on a massive scale. Meanwhile, the FBI -- the agency that is legally authorized to eavesdrop on American citizens as part of investigations authorized by judicial warrants, can't get into a terrorist's smartphone...something everyone agrees it ought to be able to do. The NSA almost certainly has the contents of Farook's iPhone -- and yours, and mine -- on a server at its massive data farm in Bluffdale, Utah. Thanks to a court order and inside-the-Beltway turf battles, however, the NSA can't/won't turn them over to the FBI. This is what happens when government treats citizens with contempt. Citizens return the favor.  4

268,http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431002/women-register-selective-service-candidates-endorse-bad-idea,"Follow Us National Review We’re Paying the Price for Refusing Controlled Burns This Day in Liberal Judicial Activism—July 26 Dobbs Can Help Us See the Cruelty That Is Abortion The Expanding Frontier of Tyranny Ilhan Omar and the Islamophobia Industry The most disappointing moment of Saturday night’s debate came when Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, and Marco Rubio each embraced the idea that women should register with the selective service, making it possible for America to draft women into ground combat. The argument for registration is based on the new Pentagon policy opening up all combat jobs to women. Women have served in non-combat roles for decades without any serious push for selective-service registration ensuing. In fact, the Supreme Court, in Rostker v. Goldberg (1981), has used the fact that men and women have different roles as justification for rejecting constitutional objections to the all-male draft. We have repeatedly condemned the Obama administration’s decision to open all combat roles to women, and we have mainly done so by citing a combination of contemporary studies and historical experience to make the case that gender-integrated ground-combat units are less effective than their all-male counterparts. But that is not the only argument. Indeed, there are other fundamental reasons to oppose not just the presence of women in the infantry but their forcible conscription into its ranks. Such a policy inverts natural law and the rules that have grounded our civilization for thousands of years. Men should protect women. They should not shelter behind mothers and daughters. Men should protect women. They should not shelter behind mothers and daughters. Indeed, we see this reality every time there is a mass shooting. Boyfriends throw themselves over girlfriends, and even strangers and acquaintances often give themselves up to save the woman closest to them. Who can forget the story of 45-year-old Shannon Johnson wrapping his arms around 27-year-old Denise Peraza and declaring “I got you” before falling to the San Bernardino shooters’ bullets? Ground combat is barbaric. Even today, men grapple with men, killing each other with anything they can find. Returning veterans describe countless incidents of hand-to-hand combat with jihadists. In his book about the Battle of Ganjgal, Into the Fire, Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer describes just such an encounter with a Taliban fighter. The Taliban tried to capture Meyer, and they ended up wrestling in the dirt. Meyer describes what happened next: I pawed at the ground with my right hand and found a rock the size of a baseball. I clutched it and swung blindly at his face. The blow stunned him. Before he could recover, I pushed off his chest, lifted the rock high in my right fist, and smashed it down like a hammer, breaking his front teeth. He looked me in the eyes, the fight knocked out of him, his head not moving. We both knew it was over. I drew back my arm and drove the stone down, crushing his left cheekbone. He went limp. I pushed up on my knees and hit him with more force. This blow caved in the left side of his forehead. I smashed his face again and again, driven by pure primal rage.  That is war. It is not a video game. It is not a movie, where young Hollywood starlets karate-kick their way through masses of inept thugs and goons. When we order women into ground combat, we are ordering them into situations where men larger and stronger than they will show no mercy — crushing the life out of them like Meyer crushed that Taliban. #share#This is what Ted Cruz was rightly arguing when he called the idea of drafting women into combat “nuts.” The idea that we would force women into combat against “a 220-pound psychopath trying to kill them” — to use Cruz’s memorable phrase — is immoral. Women would die terrible deaths, and when they did, the ripple effects on morale would likely be extreme. EDITORIAL: The Obama Administration’s Disastrous Decision on Women in Combat Why would Bush, Rubio, and Christie seem to so eagerly surrender to the prevailing winds of political correctness? Part of the problem, no doubt, is that none of them served in the military. They’re simply not familiar with the grueling demands not only of combat but also of training for battle. Part of it may well be pure political fear. After all, the “war on women” narrative harmed Republicans in 2012, so it appears that at least three GOP candidates are willing to court an actual war on women to avoid even the appearance of discrimination. Military service should not be a prerequisite for understanding morality, common sense, and natural law. Cruz hasn’t served, yet he understood the stakes. He was right, while Bush, Rubio, and Christie were wrong. But the issue’s importance goes beyond who wins the nomination contest. If America chooses not just to permit women to join the infantry but now prepares to force them into ground combat, it will take a step toward barbarism.

Republican presidential frontrunner thanks supporters after South Carolina primary win; vows to build border wall with Mexico How is it possible to have presidential contests in Nevada and South Carolina that are both appealing and appalling to conservatives? Let’s review Saturday’s results. In Nevada’s Democratic caucuses, Hillary Clinton struggled for a third consecutive time. As in Iowa and New Hampshire, she blew a double-digit lead (25 points, only a month ago), walking away with what looks like a five-point win over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Again, Clinton had difficulty in pumping up her base (she can thank Sen. Harry Reid and a last-minute labor push for getting her over the top). As per usual, she didn’t connect with millennial Democrats and voters concerned about her integrity. Clinton may go on to win the Democratic nomination. On paper, a competition that moves to the South, beginning next Saturday in South Carolina, works to her advantage given the heavily African-American electorates that await her there. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign can’t wait to bid adieu to a February in which the candidate hasn’t run so much as she’s lurched. Pre-Nevada, Hillary’s national lead over Sanders evaporated. Showing none of the certainty of a repeat presidential candidate, Clinton has fiddled with her core message (I’m a progressive who likes to get things done”) with the same frequency that she changed hairstyles back in the 1990’s. The bottom line: despite winning Nevada, Clinton’s long-term prospects remain shaky. And that should elate conservatives. Now, for the appalling: a Republican primary in South Carolina that had little do with conservative principles, ideas or values. The complaint here isn’t that Donald Trump won. Or, that his dominance again defies common sense: only a single-digit number of South Carolinians told exit pollsters that Trump shares their values; the twice-divorced candidate split the evangelical vote with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The concern: the nature of how Trump goes about his business – the king of noisy bandwidth, his bombast and calculated fights for months now have dominated news cycles, streamed ceaselessly on social media, and stifled any chance at a calm, rational, issues-driven conversation on the Republican slide. South Carolina was yet another casualty. The primary was an opportunity to discuss what exactly the conservative movement embodies these days. Now, the moment’s passed. To the need to broadening the party’s appeal to win national elections, there was a chance to showcase Gov. Nikki Haley (the nation’s only female Indian-American head of state) and Sen. Tim Scott (one of only two African-American senators). Both supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who dominated the exit-poll electability question. Both played cameos roles compared to the candidates’ infighting. South Carolina leads the nation in direct foreign investment and has a veteran population 25 percent larger than the national average. Last year, the state dealt gracefully with three divisive issues: lowering the Confederate flag at the state Capitol; a mass shooting at a black church in Charleston that led to an outpouring of calm, not violence; the fatal police shooting of black man in North Charleston that likewise didn’t turn into urban riots. So where was the conversation regarding growing the economy, the perils of union over-reach (West Virginia, like South Carolina, becoming a right-to-work state this past week), a more coherent foreign policy and a more united society across racial and ideological lines? The answer: they all were smothered by Trump’s antics – and a malady best described as Candidate Derangement Syndrome. During the course of the GOP’s 10-day road trip down south, Trump threatened to sue Cruz over an ad claiming the GOP frontrunner once supported abortion rights. Trump went mano-a-mitre with Pope Francis over building a border wall. He blamed George W. Bush for the 9/11 attacks, insinuating that the former president lied his way into the Iraq invasion. Trump even called for a boycott of Apple products so long as the computer refuses to hack into a dead terrorist’s iPhone. The media ate it up. Not surprisingly, the primary played into the stereotype of South Carolina as a political circus. In fairness, Trump’s not the only offender here. Cruz and Rubio spit-balled each other over character flaws, policy inconsistencies and sloppy photo-shopping. Jeb Bush went after Trump in defense of his big brother and in vain hopes of jump-starting a campaign that ended not long after the polls closed. The question moving forward for conservatives: is this the way it’s going to be until someone earns 1,237 delegates and the party’s nomination? With three primaries down and another 17 Republican contests to be held over the course of the next two weeks, look for the following dominos to tumble. Bush. There’s a saying in Silicon Valley: “WFIO”. It stands for “We’re F---ed, It’s Over.” Credit Jeb Bush with recognizing in an instant that his campaign was over. His concession speech was dignified and without a trace of bitterness – rarities in this age of harsh politics. Other candidates who’d spend nearly $81 million in ads ($15 million in South Carolina) with only four delegates to show night not have been so graceful. Now, the political question: how quickly does Bush throw his organizational and financial weight behind Rubio? It’s a good question, as relations between the Floridians are strained, but nowhere near Bush’s animosity for Trump. Rubio. As was the case after his third-place finish in Iowa, opportunity knocks. So how does Rubio capitalize on newfound moment? Look for an infusion of cash and a spate of endorsements. Rubio’s priorities in the weeks ahead: amassing delegates on March 1 (much easier now that Bush is out of the race), winning Florida on March 15. Meanwhile, circle this date: Feb. 25. It’s the next GOP candidates’ debate – University of Houston, CNN and Telemundo moderating. And it’s Rubio’s next chance to shine as the establishment’s alternative to Trump and Cruz. Cruz. Six March 1 states line up as targets for Cruz – Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and his home state of Texas. For Cruz, the goal is to stay close to Trump by winning as many delegates as possible in these winner-takes-most states that allot the delegates proportionally. The key figure for Cruz and Rubio, presuming Trump continues to run in the low- to mid-30’s: 20 percent, which is the threshold required in most states in order to earn delegates. Trump. Yes, he won. Decisively so. But as the attention focuses on three candidates, does Trump’s share of the pie expand? Trump’s support so far: 24.3 percent in Iowa; 35.3 percent in New Hampshire; 33 percent in South Carolina. For those who see Trump as a media-savvier version of Pat Buchanan’s insurrection back in 1992, this reminder: Buchanan peaked at 37.5 percent in New Hampshire; he then had trouble cracking 30 percent. The protest movement had a ceiling. Unlike Buchanan’s run, Trump is actually winning states. Whether he can get to 40 percent and beyond: it’s the difference between a race that could be over by Easter Sunday or an unsettled national convention in July. With the Republican race staying in the South through March 1, perhaps it’s best to remember a NASCAR adage about the pushing and shoving and fender-bending that occurs along the speedway: “rubbing’s racing”. That’s true in this Republican field, even if the process rubs conservatives the wrong way. Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.

273,http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup,"Last modified on Thu 22 Feb 2018 13.15 GMT Icelandic author Ragnar Jonasson’s excellent debut novel, Snowblind, was widely praised for its distinctive blend of Nordic noir and golden age detective fiction. Nightblind (translated by Quentin Bates, Orenda Books, £8.99), also featuring police officer Ari Thor Arason and set in Siglufjörður, an isolated fishing village hard by the Arctic Circle, certainly lives up to the promise of its predecessor. Siglufjörður is enveloped in the darkness of winter when Inspector Herjólfur is shot while checking on an abandoned farmhouse in the middle of the night, and Ari Thor’s investigation soon becomes a stumble through another murky labyrinth of local politics and long-hidden family secrets. Told from several points of view – everyone has their own agenda, whether it’s building empires, escaping from abusive former partners or simply keeping shtoom in order to avoid trouble – this is an atmospheric portrayal of a claustrophobic place where everyone is connected. The device of interspersing the text with pages from a diary written on a psychiatric ward some 30 years earlier may seem crude, but Jonasson’s economical and evocative prose, as well as some masterful prestidigitation, more than compensate.  I’m Travelling Alone, the debut crime novel from Samuel Bjork (translated from Norwegian by Charlotte Barslund, Bantam Press, £12.99), is an overstuffed, unwieldy book, with an alarming proliferation of narrators passing the baton to tell the story of the investigation into a serial killer who is targeting little girls. The children are discovered hanging from trees, dressed in dolls clothing, with airline tags bearing the eponymous message hung around their necks. That said, there are two very appealing leading characters in the form of police officer Holger Munch, a “fat, amiable nerd” who dotes on his six-year-old granddaughter, and brilliant but disturbed profiler Mia Krüger. Although the plot suffers from an over-reliance on the latter’s intuitive leaps to get things moving, and there is an inevitability (given Munch’s granddaughter) to the fact that it all becomes personally focused, this is, nevertheless, a compelling novel, with plenty of intrigue and some splendid action sequences. A pleasingly suspenseful mixture of legal thriller and whodunnit, Alafair Burke’s latest novel, The Ex (Faber, £12.99), introduces us to lippy, take-no‑prisoners New York City district attorney Olivia Randall, who receives a panicky phone call from the teenage daughter of her former fiance, Jack Harris, begging for help. Harris, whose wife was killed in a mass shooting three years earlier, has been charged with triple homicide, which the police are treating as a revenge attack because one of the victims is the father of the boy who shot his wife. For Olivia, representing Jack is a way to make up for the hurt she caused him in the past, but his alibi is flimsy and there is corroborating evidence, and she begins to wonder if he may, after all, be guilty. Burke’s writing has always been intelligent and often funny, and her female protagonists sharp and engaging – The Ex is her best yet. A Masterpiece of Corruption (Constable, £19.99) is the second of LC Tyler’s novels set during the Interregnum and featuring law student John Grey. The year is 1657, and a case of mistaken identity results in Grey, who has republican sympathies, finding himself in the middle of a plot by the Sealed Knot, a secret royalist association, to assassinate Oliver Cromwell in order that Charles Stuart may return from exile to take his place on the throne. Forced into the role of double agent, caught up in a dizzying whirl of plot and counterplot and anxious to save his own skin, Grey, the son of a royalist, begins to question exactly where his own loyalties lie. Grey is a likable, dryly humorous protagonist, and Tyler, who uses a mixture of real and invented characters, has created a credible, and credibly bamboozling, atmosphere of paranoia as the two factions are increasingly riven by internal strife, with lofty ideals giving way to expediency. Bearing in mind that anything described as having cult status should be viewed with deep suspicion, Jack O’Connell’s award-winning debut, Box Nine (No Exit Press, £12.99), which was originally published in 1992, isn’t half bad. The first of five novels set in the fictional New England city of Quinsigamond, it combines subgenres – police procedural and hardboiled – with elements of horror and mild SF. A powerful new drug, whose effects are those of “speed, Spanish fly and a Berlitz course in one quick pop” followed by an uncontrollable urge to massacre everyone in sight, affects the inhabitants of this decaying industrial landscape. Provided you can swallow the coincidence of twins in different professions – narcotics cop Lenore and postal worker Ike – becoming independently involved in the same case, this is a high-octane page-turner.",2016-02-19 07:00:39,The best recent crime novels – review roundup,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
274,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2016/02/as_questions_remain_healing_be.html," Gallery: Several people dead in multiple Kalamazoo County shootings KALAMAZOO, MI - Kalamazoo has changed. It's a city known for craft beer. The Kalamazoo Promise. The place Derek Jeter grew up. But that was the Kalamazoo before Saturday, Feb. 20, when a gunman unleashed hell with the trigger of his 9 mm handgun in the deadliest shooting spree the community has ever experienced. What once seemed unfathomable here is now horrible reality. Six people are dead, struck down in a span of 16 minutes. Another was seriously wounded and a 14-year-old girl is fighting for her life. Four of the dead were women, friends who were headed home after dinner and show. Two were a father and son who had stopped at a car dealership. Police have said the attacks were random. In some instances, they allege, Jason Brian Dalton ambushed his victims before killing them in cold blood. All of this in between shuttling people around town as an Uber driver. Dalton gave 14 rides Feb. 20. Fourteen fares over six hours. Eight shot. Six dead. Two injured. Countless people on edge and in shock. And one key question, so far left unanswered: Why? Why would this 45-year-old insurance adjuster and married father charged with the shootings apparently snap? He had no criminal record, no mental health history as far as investigators can tell. He even earned an associate degree in law enforcement. The mass shooting has thrust Kalamazoo into the national spotlight and the ongoing debate about gun control. The city has joined the list of traumatized cities. Newtown. San Bernardino. Aurora. And now, Kalamazoo. ""Our world has become a little smaller,"" Mayor Bobby Hopewell told a crowd of people last week at a candlelight vigil. Even with the senselessness of what has taken place, there are tales of heroism and resiliency, reminders that the bad will not overtake all that is good. Tiana Carruthers, who police say was Dalton's first victim and who authorities say will survive, put herself between the gunman and children who ran to safety as she was shot multiple times. And there's Abigail Kopf, the teenager who was gravely wounded. Thought in the first hours after the shootings to be the seventh fatality, she has hung onto life through the week. Lives have been changed forever for the families touched by the horror, including Dalton's. They and Kalamazoo will try to heal and find ways to move past it all. But things will never be quite the same. How it all unfolded How Dalton spent Feb. 20 has become clearer in the days since his alleged shooting rampage. It has provided answers to some questions, while prompting a whole new set of unanswered ones. What is known is at about 3 p.m., the Cooper Township man went with a friend to Southwick's, a gun store in Plainwell. While the friend perused the selection of firearms, Dalton spent $85 on a black tactical jacket with a chest pocket designed to conceal a handgun. Dalton was a regular at Southwick's since early 2015, and store owner Jonathan Southwick said he recognized him by face but not name. Southwick said Dalton seemed to be in good spirits and talked about enjoying the sunny weather. ""He was smiling and joking around, and he did a one-armed hug to my manager and told him to have a good day,"" Southwick recalled. ""That was it."" Dalton's demeanor changed, though, about 90 minutes later when, just before 4:30 p.m., he was in Kalamazoo and giving an Uber ride to Matt Mellen. Mellen, according to police, was one of Dalton's 14 fares that day for the rideshare service. Before, during and after the shooting rampage, Dalton gave rides to Uber users, investigators have said. Mellen recounted his wild ride with Dalton to media, including Time magazine, saying, ""I was pleading with him to stop the car so I could get out, but he wouldn't stop. We blew past my destination, whipped down the next block. I was just pointing at random houses just so he could stop. He slammed on the brakes, and I ran out. I could smell burning rubber from the drive."" Mellen told reporters Dalton gave him a different name when he picked him up and that there was a dog in the backseat of the Equinox. About a mile into the trip, Mellen said, Dalton got a phone call and then began driving erratically, driving over medians and up onto lawns. After he bailed out of Dalton's car, Mellen said, he contacted Uber to report Dalton. And he called 911 to alert police. The episode prompted Mellen's fiancee to take to Facebook. In a post at 5:33 p.m. Saturday, she warned others that the Uber driver in a silver Chevrolet Equinox was driving erratically and ""sideswiped a car blowing through the stop sign at Henderson Castle and West Main Hill"" while Mellon was in the car. Uber officials, who confirmed that Dalton was cleared to become a driver on Jan. 25 after passing a background check, have acknowledged getting complaints Feb. 20 from customers who reported that Dalton was driving erratically. However, the company has declined to discuss how it responded. Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said dispatchers received Mellen's 911 call reporting Dalton's erratic driving at 4:32 p.m. Information about an Uber driver driving erratically was relayed to officers via radio and their in-car computers, he said. Hadley said officers were given a description of Dalton's vehicle, but no Public Safety officers spotted the Equinox. By just after 5:40 p.m., Dalton was in Richland Township, about seven miles northeast of where he had been with Mellen on West Main Street. He made his way to The Meadows townhomes, a complex off East G Avenue, just west of Gull Road near Eastern Hills Golf Course. There, he came across Carruthers, 25, who was with three to five children in a play area. According to police, something about Dalton alarmed Carruthers and she asked the children to head for home, at one point telling them to run. As the children made it to safety, Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said, Carruthers stayed back as Dalton allegedly opened fire, wounding her multiple times. Rescue workers found Carruthers on the ground. Investigators recovered 10 shell casings. Carruthers was able to give a description of the shooter, telling deputies he was an older, heavy-set white male with brown and graying hair. She later identified Dalton in a police lineup. The man was driving a Chevrolet Equinox or Traverse, witnesses told police. As reports of the shooting and a description of a vehicle and suspect were received, Hadley said the city dispatcher who talked with Mellen recognized the description of the vehicle was similar to what Mellen had reported. At that point, Hadley said, the dispatcher contacted Mellen to see if he had a photo of the Uber driver. Mellen did and sent the photo to the dispatcher's personal cellphone. Between 6:30 and 6:40 p.m., Hadley said, the dispatcher shared Dalton's photo with county dispatchers as deputies tried to track down Carruthers' shooter. It's not clear where Dalton went after Carruthers was shot. The next victims -- 17-year-old Tyler Smith and Tyler's father, Rich, 53, both of Mattawan -- weren't shot until 10:08 p.m. What has become clear, though, is that between the shootings in Richland Township and the killings of the Smiths at Seeyle Kia on Stadium Drive in Kalamazoo, began driving a dark-colored Chevrolet HHR. Michigan Secretary of State records show the Equinox was registered to Dalton and his wife. Records show the HHR is registered to Dalton's parents in Kalamazoo. The HHR is the vehicle seen in surveillance videos from Seelye, where the Smiths were shot, and at the Cracker Barrel on South Ninth Street in Oshtemo Township. That's where police say Dalton fired multiple gunshots into two vehicles, critically injuring Abigail and killing Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda; and Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74; Barbara Hawthorne, 68, and Mary Jo Nye, 60, all of Battle Creek. Surveillance video showed Tyler and Rich Smith apparently never had a chance to react after the gunman crept up on them in the car lot and opened fire, according to Mickey Seelye, general manager and part owner of Seelye Automotive, who viewed the footage. Both died from multiple gunshots. Tyler's girlfriend was in the Smiths' car and witnessed the shootings. Police assume Dalton did not see her, and she was able to call 911. Just 16 minutes later, the Nyes, Brown and Hawthorne were dead, and Abigail was left critically injured by more gunfire in the Cracker Barrel parking lot. ""It kind of goes to show you, none of us are safe,"" Daniel Arnold, Brown's friend and neighbor in Battle Creek, said the next day. ""Just going out to eat for a bite with your friends, you'd never expect something like that."" The four women and Abigail were the last of Dalton's alleged victims. Afterward, he gave more rides to Uber fares in the HHR, at one point brushing off questions from a rider who jokingly asked him if he was the shooter wanted in the police manhunt. At 12:40 a.m. Sunday, a sheriff's deputy spotted the HHR in downtown Kalamazoo and took Dalton into custody with the help of other officers a short distance away. Inside the car, police found a 9 mm handgun and other evidence that has yet to be disclosed publicly. Life in prison? At his arraignment Monday, Dalton was unemotional as his image shone on a video screen in a Kalamazoo courtroom. He stared straight forward, his eyes fixed as District Judge Christopher T. Haenicke read off the charges against him: six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight counts of felony firearm use. He faces life in prison without chance of parole if convicted of premeditated murder. Dalton said little, speaking only to answer two yes-or-no questions and telling the judge he wished to remain silent when asked if he wanted to address his bond. Haenicke denied bond and assigned court-appointed counsel, Eusebio Solis, of Battle Creek, to be Dalton's attorney. Solis, a seasoned lawyer, formerly served as a Calhoun County commissioner and chief assistant prosecutor. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting has said he believes the case his office is mounting against Dalton is strong. The three detectives who testified to obtain an arrest warrant for Dalton said he told them he ""took people's lives"" and admitted to shooting the Smiths. They said he also admitted to being at the scene of the Cracker Barrel shooting. The detectives' testimony provided no clues as to what might have driven Dalton to allegedly inflict the carnage of Feb. 20. Dalton gave no clues during his arraignment. Along with the handgun found in the HHR Dalton was driving, police also seized 15 guns from his house at 7031 Douglas Ave. in Cooper Township. All of the weapons are being tested and examined by the Michigan State Police crime lab. The 9 mm pistol from the HHR was registered to Dalton and owned legally, although Dalton did not have a license to carry a concealed pistol. U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives investigators confirmed Dalton bought the alleged murder weapon in mid-2015. ATF officials said they know where Dalton purchased the gun, but have declined to release that information publicly. For now, Dalton will sit in the Kalamazoo County Jail. He is due back in court March 10 for a preliminary examination hearing that, if held, might provide some answers about a motive and maybe begin to help make sense of the senseless acts for which he stands accused. ""We don't know why he did this yet,"" Getting said after the arraignment. ""... This is just a tremendous loss ... and no one understands why it happened and that adds to the fear and the sorrow."" Starting to heal So where does Kalamazoo go from here? While the actions of a lone gunman deeply shook the community and will have lasting impact, it also has brought about a sense of unity, love and compassion. It has inspired solidarity and a community pride, a sense of light in the midst of the darkness. On Twitter, the hashtag #WeAreKalamazoo was born. On Monday, President Barack Obama called the mayor and other officials to offer his condolences and whatever federal resources are needed. The United Way and community foundations for Kalamazoo and Battle Creek have collaborated on a fund for the victims, among other fundraisers. There have been candlelight vigils and church services to honor and remember the victims, and there will be more. A 10-mile procession from Mattawan High School to Calvary Bible Church in Kalamazoo was organized for the funeral service for Tyler and Rich Smith on Saturday, followed by a balloon release at Seeyle Kia coinciding with the hour the father and son were killed a week earlier. ""I just don't want them to be remembered as victims,"" Tyler Smith's sister, Emily, said Tuesday during a candlelight vigil near the high school where Tyler was set to graduate this spring. ""They wouldn't want that."" As the week progressed, Carruthers recovered in one hospital, as Abigail hung on in another. ""Abigail remains critically ill but is continuing to show improvement,"" her parents, Gene and Vicki Kopf, of Battle Creek, said Thursday in a prepared statement. ""She is responding to staff, has given thumbs-up and wiggled her toes. We anticipate further improvement over the next several days."" As his office prepares to prosecute Dalton, Getting said it has been gratifying to see how not only Kalamazoo, but also Mattawan and Battle Creek have responded to the tremendous loss and tragedy. ""I am proud of the communities' refusal to be defined by one of our worst moments,"" Getting said. ""Out of our sorrow and our anger has come a renewed strength."" The date Feb. 20, 2016 and the lives of those taken surely will never be forgotten. The healing has begun and it will continue. But Kalamazoo has been changed.

But why are tech companies so afraid? Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 20.59 BST Facebook and Twitter stepped into the battle with the FBI, with both companies pledging that they “stand with Apple” and will “aggressively fight” attempts to weaken encryption. Apple is heading deeper in to a legal battle with the FBI, which is attempting to access encrypted information on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers.  “We condemn terrorism and have total solidarity with victims of terror. Those who seek to praise, promote, or plan terrorist acts have no place on our services,” Facebook said in a statement on Thursday. “However, we will continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems. These demands would create a chilling precedent and obstruct companies’ efforts to secure their products.” Shortly before, Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, tweeted: “We stand with @timcook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)!” We stand with @tim_cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)! https://t.co/XrnGC9seZ4 The support of both companies follows remarkable public statements by Silicon Valley figures including Sundar Pichai, CEO of Apple’s biggest rival Google, who wrote on Wednesday that “requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data … could be a troubling precedent”. Although technology companies generally are on the same page when it comes to surveillance, this latest episode may show the greatest amount of solidarity to date over a specific conflict with the government. A federal magistrate has ordered Apple to create and digitally sign a software update that would make it easier to guess the password of an iPhone 5c. The device belonged to Syed Farook, one of the killers in a mass shooting at a government building near Los Angeles, California, and the FBI has said they are unable to break into it because of Apple’s security measures. That prospect scares technology companies for several reasons. Industry lawyers argue that if the government can force them to create software and upload it to a targeted phone through the software update process, it will wreck the trust that consumers have in the tech company’s security patches. If this precedent is set, the lawyers argue, what is to stop a judge from forcing Apple or Google to help the FBI upload spyware on to a suspect’s phone? The FBI and the White House have said investigators in this case are only interested in getting inside Farook’s phone. Presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton also commented on the conflict during a debate in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 18 February. Both said they would like to find a middle ground and avoided taking sides. “I’m on both [sides]. This is a very complicated issue,” said Sanders. “I am very fearful in America about ‘big brother’ and that means not only the federal government getting into your emails or knowing what books you’re taking out of the library … I worry about that very much. On the other hand, what I also worry about is the possibility of another terrorist attack against our country … Clearly all of us would be very dismayed if we learned that we could’ve picked up information about a potential terrorist attack and we didn’t do that.” Clinton said: “This is one of the most difficult dilemmas that we’re faced with … What I keep calling for is to try to get the government and our great tech companies to figure out what is the path forward … I see both sides, and I think most citizens see both sides … I’m really making a plea that the government and the tech companies keep working together to see if there isn’t some legitimate way to deal with these very real problems that we deal with.”",2016-02-18 20:28:17,Facebook and Twitter back Apple in phone encryption battle with FBI,"privacy,computers and the internet,computer software,terrorism,crime and criminals",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us. During a marathon Congressional hearing, Apple declined to propose its own legislative solution for striking the proper balance between a citizen’s right to privacy and security and law enforcement’s need for evidence to prosecute crimes. Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner warned: “I can tell you you’re not going to like what comes out of Congress.” Here’s what D.C. is working on right now: Apple, meanwhile, is reportedly working on bolstering security features to make it harder for the government to hack its devices in the future. And that could very well be Apple’s endgame. If it can get a new phone to market that is essentially uncrackable, any legislative outcome may be moot. Technology and advocacy groups have been rallying around Apple. Some 40 companies and associations are expected to file friend-of-the-court briefs Thursday supporting Apple’s position in the face of a court order requiring the company to help the FBI circumvent encryption on the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the San Bernardino mass shooting. Even the spouse of one of the survivors in the Dec. 2 attack, Salihin Kondoker, wrote a letter to the judge supporting Apple’s position on encryption. “In the wake of this terrible attack, I believe strongly we need stronger gun laws,” Kondoker wrote. “It was guns that killed innocent people, not technology.” This article originally appeared on Recode.net.

The Cupertino, California-based company has reacted furiously. Apple CEO Tim Cook has published an extremely strongly worded letter, calling the demand ""chilling,"" arguing that it ""would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect."" So what's the big deal? First, some background: FBI investigators are trying to access data on the phone of one of the two San Bernardino shooters who killed 14 people and injured 22 more in a mass shooting in California in December. They're looking to work out how the two were influenced by Islamist terrorist groups, according to The Guardian. The FBI has therefore taken Apple to court to try to get its help in unlocking the phone. It isn't trying to get Apple to remove the encryption on the device altogether; rather, it is trying to get Apple to create software that bypasses the limit on the number of passcode attempts you can enter before the device auto-wipes. That would let investigators gain access to the device by trying every possible combination. A US magistrate on Tuesday ordered Apple to assist the FBI in this. Apple has indicated it intends to appeal — for reasons we'll get to shortly. In the years after NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden's revelations about the US government's mass-surveillance programs, there have been a heightened awareness of privacy issues and moves to strengthen protections on consumer products. Apple has been one of the strongest voices in support of this move, and all new iPhones and Apple devices are now encrypted by default. This has, predictably, infuriated some in law enforcement, who argue that vital evidence is ""going dark."" (Note: A recent Harvard study claims that rather than going dark, investigators have more evidence at their fingertips than ever before.) James Comey, the director of the FBI, supports backdoors into encrypted products to allow law enforcement access when required, and there have also been legislative calls to mandate encryption backdoors. Technologists and privacy advocates are strongly resisting this. There are numerous arguments against encryption backdoors, including that they would be subject to abuse by malicious hackers, that they would be ineffective because the criminals they intend to catch would simply switch to uncompromised encryption tools, and that it would set a dangerous precedent for authoritarian regimes to demand backdoor access from tech companies so they could crack down on activists and dissidents. Let's get back to the San Bernardino case. What the FBI is asking for perhaps isn't a backdoor in the traditional sense — it's not an extra encryption key held in escrow that would let investigators immediately decrypt the iPhone data they're after. Cook says what the FBI is asking for does not exist, and Apple would have to make it. ""The FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software — which does not exist today — would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession."" He argues that complying will make ordinary people ""less safe."" In his words (emphasis ours): The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks — from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable. The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers — including tens of millions of American citizens — from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe. We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. For years, cryptologists and national security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. Doing so would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data. Criminals and bad actors will still encrypt, using tools that are readily available to them. The Apple CEO then describes the demand as a ""dangerous precedent,"" which would grant the US government ""the power to reach into anyone's device to capture their data."" ""The government,"" Cook continued, ""could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone's microphone or camera without your knowledge."" He concludes: ""While we believe the FBI's intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect."" The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group, is supporting Apple. It says it worries that the FBI's demands set a precedent and that if Apple is forced to create the code, then the code will be used again and again. ""Essentially, the government is asking Apple to create a master key so that it can open a single phone. And once that master key is created, we're certain that our government will ask for it again and again, for other phones, and turn this power against any software or device that has the audacity to offer strong security. "" Opsahl added: ""The U.S. government wants us to trust that it won't misuse this power. But we can all imagine the myriad ways this new authority could be abused. Even if you trust the U.S. government, once this master key is created, governments around the world will surely demand that Apple undermine the security of their citizens as well.""     Cook has made it clear his company is opposing the order, because ""we feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the US government."" Now comes a (most likely lengthy) legal showdown between the FBI and Apple — one that privacy activists and law enforcement will be watching extremely carefully. The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand. This moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake. Smartphones, led by iPhone, have become an essential part of our lives. People use them to store an incredible amount of personal information, from our private conversations to our photos, our music, our notes, our calendars and contacts, our financial information and health data, even where we have been and where we are going. All that information needs to be protected from hackers and criminals who want to access it, steal it, and use it without our knowledge or permission. Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data. Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk. That is why encryption has become so important to all of us. For many years, we have used encryption to protect our customers’ personal data because we believe it’s the only way to keep their information safe. We have even put that data out of our own reach, because we believe the contents of your iPhone are none of our business. We were shocked and outraged by the deadly act of terrorism in San Bernardino last December. We mourn the loss of life and want justice for all those whose lives were affected. The FBI asked us for help in the days following the attack, and we have worked hard to support the government’s efforts to solve this horrible crime. We have no sympathy for terrorists. When the FBI has requested data that’s in our possession, we have provided it. Apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants, as we have in the San Bernardino case. We have also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI, and we’ve offered our best ideas on a number of investigative options at their disposal. We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone. Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software — which does not exist today — would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession. The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control. Some would argue that building a backdoor for just one iPhone is a simple, clean-cut solution. But it ignores both the basics of digital security and the significance of what the government is demanding in this case. In today’s digital world, the “key” to an encrypted system is a piece of information that unlocks the data, and it is only as secure as the protections around it. Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge. The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that’s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks — from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable. The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers — including tens of millions of American citizens — from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe. We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. For years, cryptologists and national security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. Doing so would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data. Criminals and bad actors will still encrypt, using tools that are readily available to them. Rather than asking for legislative action through Congress, the FBI is proposing an unprecedented use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify an expansion of its authority. The government would have us remove security features and add new capabilities to the operating system, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock an iPhone by “brute force,” trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer. The implications of the government’s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone’s device to capture their data. The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone’s microphone or camera without your knowledge. Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government. We are challenging the FBI’s demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country. We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications. While we believe the FBI’s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.

According to new reports published by the Financial Times and The New York Times, the Cupertino, California-based technology giant is introducing new security measures that will make it impossible to access customers' data, both on devices and in the cloud. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple and the FBI are battling over the contents of an iPhone that belonged to one of the attackers in last year's San Bernardino mass shooting. The FBI wants access to the data, arguing that it may contain clues as to the attackers' motivations and prevent future attacks. Apple refuses to do this, arguing that building this software would make all iPhones less safe. The company's supporters also fear it would set a far-reaching precedent: Any company could be forced to create new software to hack into its users' devices. A California court has ordered Apple to comply with the FBI's demands; Apple is appealing. CEO Tim Cook says he's willing to take this battle all the way to the US Supreme Court. ""We would be prepared to take this issue all the way,"" the executive told ABC News in an interview on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly taking its security for iCloud, its cloud data hosting service, a step forward. According to the Financial Times (which bases its report on ""people familiar"" with Apple's plans), Apple is planning to encrypt iCloud backups of users' data in such a way that it doesn't hold an encryption key. This would make it impossible for the company to provide law enforcement with access to the unencrypted data, even if it wanted to. These reported measures make a legislative response to the debate all the more likely. Apple CEO Tim Cook has called for a congressional committee to discuss the issue. ""We feel the best way forward would be for the government to withdraw its demands under the All Writs Act and, as some in Congress have proposed, form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms,"" he wrote in a memo to employees.

281,http://www.mlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2016/02/kalamazoo_mass_shooting_highli.html," Gallery: Kalamazoo in mourning after mass shooting It's upsetting that, as a mass shooter terrorized the city of Kalamazoo for seven hours, shooting people with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, many residents were unaware the community was in peril until it was all over.  The life-and-death situation exposes a flaw in the public safety system: In an era when folks get a text message in the middle of the night when a child goes missing, we need a better way to alert our communities when an active shooter is on the loose. The Kalamazoo shooting spree began at 5:42 p.m., and police arrested suspected gunman Jason Dalton at 12:40 a.m.  There is no doubt law enforcement had their hands full with hunting the shooter and that Dalton's arrest likely saved lives, but both police and the public need a system in place for directly notifying people of an imminent threat in a neighborhood.   There was a stretch of more than two hours in between the third shooting at the Cracker Barrel and when police apprehended Dalton in downtown Kalamazoo -- a nighttime hotspot with a flourishing bar and restaurant scene. The murder suspect, an Uber driver, continued to pick up passengers in the midst of and after the shooting spree.  The timeline illustrates that it's not always adequate for law enforcement to have to rely on the news media and social media to spread the word when lives are immediately in danger.   The framework for a direct-to-consumer notification system is already in place. Amber Alerts are used by police when a child in danger goes missing, and universities employ emergency alert systems for campus threats. We get bulletins for severe weather and wandering senior citizens. The technology is there -- and fits in the palm of our hands.  Now is the time for law enforcement and lawmakers throughout Michigan to work together on developing a system to immediately notify people in a specific geographical area of an active emergency and, if necessary, how to stay safe. Restaurant and bar patrons, for example, deserve to know when police suspect a killer with a gun is on the streets, and whether or not to flee or shelter in place.  These emergency alerts exist for a reason and should be used when appropriate. The Western Michigan University campus community was stunned that the university didn't employ its notification system during the killing spree, prompting an apology from President John Dunn and a promise to do better.  At the same time, we recognize such an alert system would not be used in every situation as police work to track a dangerous suspect. There will be instances when it wouldn't be prudent for investigators to widely release information that could bungle a manhunt. It's a judgment call, and we trust law enforcement would use it as they see fit.  But the mechanism has to be in place when an entire community is in jeopardy.  Let's give police the tools they need using technology we already have to protect public safety and save lives.

Texas A&M University  provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list A federal magistrate judge in California has issued a warrant ordering Apple to assist the FBI in accessing data on an iPhone used by a suspect in the December 2015 San Bernardino mass shooting. Apple’s public refusal to comply with the order – and its motion asking a judge to reverse the order – has set up a legal showdown that has captivated the technology world. The public debate centers around privacy, encryption and electronic security. The warrant issued to Apple is backed by the All Writs Act, a 1789 law signed by President George Washington that gives courts broad power to issue orders for which there is no other specific statute – as long as it is consistent with the usages and principles of law. The age and sweeping scope of the law has attracted criticism and praise alike. In my view as a former federal prosecutor, the use of the All Writs Act here is nothing really novel – even if it does date back to 1789. All it says is that the courts can issue an order for which there is no other specific statute as long as it is consistent with the usages and principles of law. And the act itself was actually reenacted in the early 1900s and updated in 1948. To collect evidence, normally the government uses a search warrant – which is authorized under a specific provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In the San Bernardino case, the government has a court’s permission to examine the contents of the phone – but the phone is encrypted by a passcode only the user knew, and he is dead. To gain access to the phone’s contents in a reasonable and practical way, the court must get Apple to remove security features of the iPhone’s operating system that limit the government’s ability to crack the encryption. There is no specific statute that requires companies to perform this exact task in so many words. In this case, however, that task is consistent with the search warrant, so the court is just using the All Writs Act to order the company to help the authorized search happen by opening up the phone. The government has used the authority of the All Writs Act before. The U.S. Supreme Court sanctioned it in its 1977 ruling in US v. New York Telephone, a case that is both fascinating and instructive in this situation. In that case, the government had a court order authorizing a wiretap to listen in to conversations on a suspect’s phone, and was attempting to get the telephone company to install a pen register as well. A “pen register with trap and trace” (PR/TT) system records what numbers are dialed on a phone, as well as the source of incoming calls. Without that system, the other parties to the suspect’s phone conversations might be unknown or hard to locate. The phone company said there was no specific statute requiring it to access lines and install a pen register system. The government responded that it was natural that along with the wiretap authority would come the ability to identify the other parties on monitored calls. The Supreme Court agreed with the phone company that there was no specific law requiring the PR/TT system. But it agreed with the government that the PR/TT was in accordance with the principles of law. The court held that in the absence of a specific statute, the government could use its authority under the All Writs Act to secure the PR/TT. The court’s one caveat was that the imposition on the company should not be unreasonable. It wasn’t: the phone company already relied on PR/TTs to track incoming and outgoing calls for billing purposes. Apple has already made the argument that reengineering its operating system to remove the security features will be difficult. In addition, the company has said doing so would threaten the privacy of all its customers. I am not an information technology specialist, but those arguments seem to violate common sense. First, it’s hard to believe that Apple developed the security system in such an integrated way that removing some features would be extremely difficult for the company to do. These are, after all, some of the world’s best and brightest minds. Second, Apple does not have to give the new operating system to the government in any way that could be easily copied or distributed. It needs only to be installed on the phone, which would then be opened by FBI technicians and secured along with other case evidence. Apple should be able to keep its work secret – after all, Coke and KFC have kept their recipes secret for years. The suggestion that installing a new operating system with less security on one phone in company and FBI custody would expose millions of phones sounds implausible. The fact is the government would get access to a phone only when it shows a court probable cause that the phone contains information related to criminal activity. That means everyone else has nothing to fear. The latest complaints that government has several other iPhone access requests pending with Apple also seem ludicrous. That is a tiny handful of phones out of millions – is that such a burden on Apple? The company benefits from the laws and protection of the United States. It should at least be willing to help protect American citizens. It’s hard not to think that marketing and economics are at least somewhat behind Apple’s actions. But my guess is most people understand that the FBI would not be getting into their phones without a probable cause search warrant. In addition, I would think Apple would not want to have a market composed of people who want to use iPhones for dangerous and illegal activity. The company might actually lose more future customers because of its uncooperative attitude than it would ever lose by helping the government by complying with a court order.

284,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/technology/tech-reactions-on-apple-highlight-issues-with-government-requests.html?_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by By Nick Wingfield and Mike Isaac After a federal court ordered Apple to help unlock an iPhone used by an attacker in a December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., the company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, penned a passionate letter warning of far-reaching implications beyond the case. The response from other technology companies? A mix of carefully calibrated support and crickets. Late on Wednesday, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, said on Twitter that law enforcement demands to hack customer devices and data “could be a troubling precedent.” Not long afterward, Reform Government Surveillance, a coalition formed by Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook, released a broad statement that did not mention the Apple case or Mr. Cook’s letter but said technology companies should not be required to put “back doors” — the equivalent of a tech entryway — into their products. It took almost another 24 hours for Facebook and Twitter to weigh in. On Thursday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, posted that the company stands with Mr. Cook and Apple. Facebook issued a statement that did not mention Apple but said it would “fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems.” Asked about Apple’s opposition to the court order, representatives of Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment. The range of reactions highlights the complicated set of factors influencing tech companies’ responses to government demands for customer data in the era after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor, of widespread government surveillance. Some companies may be keeping their heads low to avoid becoming targets during the raucous presidential campaign, while others may fear that being too vocal will jeopardize government sales and relationships with law enforcement, privacy experts said. “The issue is of monumental importance, not only to the government and Apple but to the other technology giants as well,” said Tom Rubin, a former attorney for Microsoft and the United States Department of Justice, who is now a law lecturer at Harvard University. “Those companies are undoubtedly following the case intently, praying that it creates a good precedent and breathing a sigh of relief that it’s not them in the spotlight.” transcript na Mr. Cook vowed to fight a federal court order that the company help the F.B.I. bypass security measures on the iPhone because he fears complying could seriously weaken privacy protections for Apple’s customers. If the government is successful, lawyers and privacy advocates warn, other tech companies could be approached to provide back doors into their products for law enforcement. Some Silicon Valley luminaries were more direct in their support of Mr. Cook, including Jan Koum, the chief executive of WhatsApp, the mobile messaging app owned by Facebook. In a message posted to Facebook, Mr. Koum said he admired Mr. Cook’s position on privacy. “We must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set,” Mr. Koum wrote. “Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake.” But behind the scenes, there was discomfort among some companies that have generally allied themselves with Apple on the topic of government surveillance. All of the companies involved in Reform Government Surveillance, including Apple, acknowledge that they often comply with law enforcement requests for customer data when under order from a court. Apple’s stance in this case seemed overly antagonistic to some companies in the coalition, according to people privy to conversations on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record. In its statement on Wednesday, Reform Government Surveillance chose its words carefully. The association’s member companies, the statement said, “remain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers’ information.” There was also disagreement about Apple’s tactics. Gunter Ollmann, chief security officer at Vectra Networks, an information security company in San Jose, Calif., argued that the government’s demand that Apple help unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone was in line with similar one-time requests and that Apple was creating an unnecessarily high-stakes battle by framing the unlocking as creating a universal back door. “I’m concerned that since Apple has attempted to deny the F.B.I. request citing use of ‘back doors,’ should they lose this legal argument, the repercussions could be extensive to the entire security industry,” he said in a blog post. If Apple had instead framed the issue as more of a tech-specific matter, “the prospect of a lost appeal would be greatly limited,” rather than “being included in appeals over anti-terrorism and a specific instance of a horrific crime,” Mr. Ollmann added. Privacy advocates speculated that one reason Apple was willing to stake out a bolder position against what it saw as law enforcement overreach was that it is not as eager for government business as some of its rivals. Amazon has a large deal with the Central Intelligence Agency to help run its cloud computing operations, for example. On Wednesday, Microsoft promoted a deal with the United States Department of Defense under which the department will standardize its computers on the company’s Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft has also pushed back against the government on issues including a court case in New York involving an effort to get Microsoft customer data stored outside the United States. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group, said some tech companies “are a little bit uneasy doing things on the law enforcement side that might disrupt their ability to win contracts.” Privacy advocates also said that Apple was taking a stronger position on privacy matters because its business does not hinge on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data, unlike the operations of other tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter. In the past, Mr. Cook has contrasted the privacy policies of Apple, which makes the overwhelming majority of its money by selling devices like the iPhone and Macs, with those of Internet companies that make their money from advertising. “A few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, you’re not the customer,” Mr. Cook wrote in a letter on privacy posted on Apple’s site in 2014. “You’re the product.” Apple’s absolutist position is also seen by many as a reflection of Mr. Cook’s view that privacy is a human right. “They’re deeply a consumer company,” said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington. “They’re less reliant on information as a business model. They sell things. I really think their C.E.O. has religion on privacy and personality matters.” Advertisement",2016-02-19 00:00:00,Apple Letter on iPhone Security Draws Muted Tech Industry Response - The New York Times,"computers and the internet,computer software",1,http://nytimes.com

February 10, 2016 If you have a choice to be in a gun-free zone or a legal-to-carry setting, you are less likely to be the victim of a mass shooting where it is legal to carry guns. (Photo: Eric Paul/ Zamora/MCT/Newscom) Patrick Tyrrell Patrick Tyrrell is a research coordinator in The Heritage Foundation’s Center for International Trade and Economics. An analysis of mass shootings in the United States since the year 2002 shows that gun-wielding mass killers are more likely to strike where the Second Amendment right to bear arms has been supplanted by “gun-free zone” ordinances, be they federal, local, or specified by the owner of the property. The Stanford University Libraries’ dataset of mass shootings (“Stanford Mass Shootings in America, courtesy of the Stanford Geospatial Center and Stanford Libraries”) was analyzed for mass shootings over the past 14 years.  The definition of a mass shooting for the Stanford database is three or more shooting victims injured or killed, not including the shooter. Shootings that are gang- or drug-related are not included. The dataset includes 153 incidents going back to the beginning of 2002. Research done at the Heritage Foundation found that fifty-four of the 153 incidents (35 percent) involved a shooter targeting people at random who were not relatives or adversaries of the attempted murderer. Of the 54 incidents that fit these criteria, the shooter chose locations where guns were banned 37 times (69 percent). Alternatively, the shooting occurred where guns were legally allowed only 17 times (31 percent). See graphic. Of the 17 shootings that occurred where citizens could legally carry firearms, 5 (29 percent) were ended when the gunman was stopped or slowed by a gun permit holder’s intervention. If you have a choice to be in a gun-free zone or a legal-to-carry setting, you are less likely to be the victim of a mass shooting where it is legal to carry guns. All else being equal, if a killer can strike where he is less likely to face lethal law-abiding resistance from ordinary citizens, he will.

	Geoff Berkshire Associate Editor, Features Cutting through political talking points to focus on facts and firsthand accounts, “Under the Gun” is an essential primer on the rise of gun violence in the U.S. With this follow-up to the food-industry takedown “Fed Up,” director Stephanie Soechtig again proves her knack for crafting advocacy docs that resonate. One of four films in this year’s Sundance lineup to deal explicitly with mass shootings, “Gun” acknowledges the solutions to this ongoing problem are neither easy nor obvious, while persuasively arguing that more, surely, can be done. With the right handling, the passionate pic could easily surpass “Fed Up’s” solid $1.5 million domestic gross. Like its predecessor, “Under the Gun” potently combines statistics, expert commentary and personal stories into a well-researched and easy-to-consume piece of nonfiction filmmaking. It’s not necessarily artful, but it’s also never less than compelling. If anything, Soechtig has only refined her skills at packaging a slick, audience-friendly documentary with a subject that feels even more urgent.  The core frustration fueling this film is one shared by many Americans: Even after an event as horrific as the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., the U.S. Congress demonstrated its complete impotence in dealing with the issue. When a popular bill mandating near-universal background checks on gun purchases died in the Senate, it was a wake-up call for many. The steady pace of mass shootings since has only underscored the urgency of finding grassroots solutions to the problem. Popular on Variety Sandy Hook parents Mark and Jackie Barden, who lost their youngest son, Daniel, in the shooting (and are also featured in Kim A. Snyder’s more elegiac Sundance premiere, “Newtown”), are the first among many family members of gun-violence victims profiled by Soechtig and returning “Fed Up” narrator-host-exec producer Katie Couric. There’s more than just tragedy uniting the diverse group — from urban Chicago mother Pamela Bosley, whose son is one of numerous black youths in the city whose murders remain unsolved, to conservative gun owners Sandy and Lonnie Phillips, whose daughter Jessica was killed at the 2012 movie-theater shooting in Aurora, Colo. Each of these grieving parents has been rallied into action, and seeing their stories may have a similar effect on viewers. Again and again, the film’s boogeyman is the National Rifle Assn. Soechtig is careful to draw a distinction between the lobbying org’s leadership, who have close ties to gun manufacturers and actively work to block the most common-sense attempts at gun regulation, and the rank-and-file membership, who are presented as more supportive of responsible measures (like background checks) in national polls and man-on-the-street interviews. While “Under the Gun” is firmly on the side of stronger gun regulations, it’s not anti-gun. There’s an attempt to be as inclusive as possible, and time taken to explain why common refrains by the opposition — that certain government leaders want to take away everyone’s guns, the real problem is about mental health and not guns, or that the only way to prevent gun violence is to own a gun — are easier said than defended with factual information.  But the goal here isn’t to change minds; it’s to reignite the anger of the silent majority — those familiar feelings that bubble up and then dissipate whenever another mass shooting occurs. “Under the Gun” understands the typical cycle of shock, outrage, hopelessness and complacency that follows such events in the 24-hour news cycle and aims to channel those initial instincts into action. By focusing on the specific (and frequently heartbreaking) stories of the aforementioned parents, former Congresswoman and gun-violence survivor Gabrielle Giffords, and Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts — who was motivated to action by Newtown and unwittingly sparked a grassroots movement on Facebook — the film lays out the gaping holes in the system where regulations are needed, and offers hopeful examples of activism in the face of what often feels like an insurmountable problem.

But civil libertarians applaud. By TONY ROMM and TIM STARKS 02/17/2016 03:35 PM EST A long-simmering showdown between Silicon Valley and Washington over national security flared into a major political spat Wednesday, after Apple CEO Tim Cook vowed to resist the federal government’s demand for help breaking into an iPhone used by one of the attackers in last year’s deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. The dispute between the tech giant and the FBI has put the entire industry on the defensive and prompted new calls, from the 2016 campaign trail to Capitol Hill, for tech companies to cooperate in terrorism investigations. Apple’s harshest critics included Donald Trump, who asked on Fox News, “Who do they think they are?” — while Senate Intelligence Committee member Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) charged that the company had chosen to “protect a dead ISIS terrorist's privacy over the security of the American people.” But civil liberties and privacy groups defended Apple, with the American Civil Liberties Union warning that the government's request “risks setting a dangerous precedent.” “If the FBI can force Apple to hack into its customers' devices, then so too can every repressive regime in the rest of the world,” ACLU staff attorney Alex Abdo said. “Apple deserves praise for standing up for its right to offer secure devices to all of its customers."" Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), a tea party conservative, also took the company’s side. “Govt's demand that Apple undermine safety & privacy of all its customers is unconscionable & unconstitutional,” he said on Twitter, adding: ""Thank you, @tim_cook, for defending our rights."" The White House, for its part, refused to jump into the fray, although press secretary Josh Earnest rejected Apple’s accusation that the FBI was seeking a “backdoor” to encrypted communications on iPhones. The FBI “is not asking Apple to redesign its product or create a new backdoor to one of its products,” Earnest said. “They’re asking for something that would have an impact on this one device.” By TONY ROMM The feud erupted Wednesday after a federal judge ordered Apple to create and install special software on the suspect's iPhone so that investigators could try an unlimited number of passwords to crack the device, which is set up to erase its contents after too many failed attempts. The iPhone, found near the site of the December massacre in California that killed 14 people, had been used by one of the shooters, Syed Farook, who authorities say had expressed support for the Islamic State. Essentially, the FBI wants Apple to eliminate the phone's digital self-destruct mechanism so that investigators have time to break into the device. Once that special software is installed, how long it takes investigators to crack the device's security could depend on what kind of password Farook used. It could take investigators' computers about an hour to crack a four-digit numeric password by trying every possible combination, said cryptologist Matt Green, an assistant professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University. It could take up to 100 hours to break a six-digit password, Green said, but the time could be much longer if Farook had used a complex assortment of letters, numbers and other symbols. Farook’s county-owned phone was reportedly running the latest version of Apple’s iOS operating system, whose encryption is difficult to break and is protected by electronic ""keys"" that the company does not retain. On the other hand, Farook's phone was a 5C model, which debuted in 2013 and lacks more modern security protections that make it harder — but not impossible — to write software to tamper with them. In an open letter to customers, Cook wrote of the consequences if Apple is forced to bypass the phone's safeguards. ""In the wrong hands, this software — which does not exist today — would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession,"" he wrote. The judge’s decision amounted to a major victory for the Justice Department, where top law enforcement officials have long fretted about the difficulty of cracking terrorists' and criminals’ encrypted communications on smartphones and apps. But it drew an unusually harsh response from Cook, who slammed the government's move as an ""overreach."" The volley of rhetoric that followed represented a new, more intense phase in the long-running debate over how much help tech companies should offer in the fight against terrorism. Top administration officials, including FBI Director James Comey, have warned for years that terrorists are “going dark,” relying on private channels to plan and execute attacks. But Apple and other tech firms argue that granting special access to the U.S. government would create security risks that harm average Americans and would encourage foreign governments — such as China — to demand similar concessions.  Their fierce opposition comes in the wake of Edward Snowden's damaging leaks about the broad scope of U.S. surveillance, revelations that stung the industry worldwide and left companies scrambling to affirm their commitments to users' privacy. When officials including Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with tech executives in Silicon Valley last month to seek the industry’s help in the online fight against the Islamic State, Cook even asked them to take a public stance in favor of strong encryption. But they have issued no such statement. Apple's rebuke quickly generated shock waves on Wednesday in the presidential campaign, in which every remaining Republican candidate has called for greater surveillance of potential terrorist threats. “Well I hope they would voluntarily, because ultimately I believe being a good corporate citizen is important,” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Wednesday when asked about the Apple case. “Look, I think this is a tough issue, there’s no easy answer for the encryption issue. Because on the one hand this encryption was designed to prevent people from having unauthorized access to private information.” Other leading candidates — including Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and GOP contenders like Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush — did not respond to requests for comment. Previously, Clinton has called for a “Manhattan-like Project” to address the thorny issue of encryption, a suggestion that drew ridicule from civil-liberties leaders. The Apple case could also galvanize activity on Capitol Hill, where tech companies have long faced the threat of legislation that could undermine their security systems. Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and top panel Democrat Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), for example, have said they intend to write legislation to give law enforcement and intelligence agencies access to encrypted products.  And Feinstein specifically offered her defense of the court order Wednesday: ""It's not unreasonable for Apple to provide technical assistance when ordered by the court,"" she said. By NICK GASS Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has proposed the idea of legislation that directs companies to provide access with lawful warrants, while leaving the specifics up to the industry. Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has suggested a new commission to the study the issue. The House Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, is expected to hold a hearing on encryption at the beginning of March, an aide told POLITICO on Wednesday. While the Obama administration decided last year not to ask Congress for legislation that would require tech companies to offer a backdoor to law enforcement, law enforcement officials have pursued their goals through the legal system. In seeking Tuesday’s ruling from Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym, the Justice Department said Apple had not cooperated when investigators tried to crack Farook’s iPhone. The FBI said it had a copy of an iCloud backup of Farook’s phone, but it couldn’t access data stored on the phone itself between Oct. 15 and Dec. 2, the date of the attack. Comey appeared to suggest during an appearance on Capitol Hill last week that the U.S. government had struggled to tap the device. ""You know, San Bernardino, a very important investigation to us,” he told the Senate Intelligence Committee. “We still have one of those killer's phones that we have not been able to open. It's been over two months now, we're still working on it.” In his open letter, Cook said Apple had cooperated with the FBI, but that the magnitude of the case requires the company to fight the request. “We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them,” the Apple CEO said. “But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone. “We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack,” he added. Apple and federal prosecutors have already been grappling for months in an unrelated case in New York, where the company has resisted government demands that it unlock a meth dealer's iPhone. In that case, Magistrate Judge James Orenstein suggested in October that the government was probably overstepping its authority under an 18th-century law known as the All Writs Act, while the company has argued that giving in to the prosecutors' demands ""could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand.""

After only six days into the first month of 2016, three people had already died as a result of a mass shooting. By the end of January, there were 11 mass shootings in America, with the body count spiking at 22. In Vox.com‘s analysis of GVA’s mass shooting data, we know there have been shootings in large cities like Chicago, IL, small cities like Ware Neck, VA, and the deadliest shooting incident, which occurred in Chesapeake, Va., where “a man killed five of his family members, including his grandmother, before killing himself.” According to Vox, “The January data is a stark reminder that mass shootings continue to happen with regularity in the United States — even if many of them don’t get much media coverage.” SOURCE: Vox.com, Gun Violence Archive (GVA) SEE ALSO: Chicago Authorities Believe “ACLU Effect” Has Increased Gun Violence  Sign Up For The NewsOne Newsletter An Urban One Brand Copyright © 2021	Interactive One, LLC.

We may never know. WFTV, Orlando: U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has told the gay community “we stand with you” and insisted that investigators are continuing to follow leads on the gunman and mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub… She wouldn’t give specifics about the investigation or a possible motive. She said “people often act out of more than one motivation” and called the June 12 massacre at the gay club “clearly an act of terror and an act of hate.” She added that a motive may never be known. Of course not. How could we ever know his real motive? Just because Mateen explained exactly why he did it to anybody who’d listen, that doesn’t mean it’s really why he did it. Sure, the FBI released the transcript of Mateen’s 911 call, with any references to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi or ISIS replaced with “[omitted].” And then, after they were humiliated by the public outcry, they released the uncensored transcript. Sure, none of their excuses make any sense. But that doesn’t mean Lynch has to admit it. She has a political agenda to protect. Mateen could’ve had any number of motives. Can you prove he didn’t do it for the NRA? Can you prove he didn’t do it for Mitch McConnell? Loretta Lynch stands with you, LGBT community. That’s why she’s working so hard to keep you from finding out why you were attacked. Please [omitted] my [omitted], AG Lynch. P.S.

292,http://time.com/4367213/orlando-shooting-donald-trump-immigration-terrorism/?xid=newsletter-brief,"The scripted address, the moment of silence and the gestures of solidarity toward the gay community all seemed to suggest a different Donald Trump might have shown up Monday in New Hampshire. But in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, the presumptive Republican nominee instead sharpened the theme that has marked his upstart campaign: the threat of the immigrant lurking among us. Trump decried the inadequate screening and “tremendous flow” of Syrian refugees. He reiterated his support for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. even though the suspected shooter was born in America. And he moved to further restrict Islamic immigration by calling for the country to close its borders to nations with a record of exporting terrorism. “When I am elected,” Trump said in a prepared speech at Saint Anselm College outside Manchester, “I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.” Read More: Transcript of Trump’s Speech on the Orlando Shooting It was a promise that no other major-party nominee in modern history would have made. In the anguished aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, President George W. Bush was careful to delineate the difference between a war against a terrorist sect and a war against Islam. When rally-goers called Barack Obama a “terrorist” and an “Arab” in the waning days of the 2008 campaign, John McCain defended his opponent’s decency. Even as he criticized Obama’s approach to combatting terrorism, Mitt Romney described Islam as a religion of peace. This is not Trump’s style. Throughout his life, he has often found the seams in the cultural fabric and exploited them for personal gain. And he has brought the tactics of tribal warfare from business into politics. Since the start of his campaign, he has cast nonwhite groups, American citizens or not, as a threat to the nation’s security and way of life. People coming over the border are “bad hombres.” Black Lives Matter protesters are “bad dudes.” Refugees fleeing war-torn Syria “could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,” Trump warned Monday. The same impulse that prompted Trump to attack an American judge of Mexican heritage was on display in a national-security speech that was supposed to be sober and measured. Trump’s is a campaign in which law-abiding citizens are suspect simply because of their background, and entire classes of people become sleeper threats. The facts often don’t match the rhetoric. The GOP nominee noted that the suspected killer — a Queens, N.Y., native, just like Trump — would not have committed the atrocity in Orlando had his Afghan parents been denied entry to the U.S. “According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Shari‘a law,” Trump said, explaining the roots of his idea to bar immigrants from countries that incubate Islamic fanaticism. Shari‘a, or Islamic law, is often misconstrued in the West as a system that relies on ghastly retributive justice — such as punishing adultery with death by stoning, or cutting off the hand of a thief. But Shari‘a is a broad term for the set of ethical principles inscribed in the Quran. It means different things to different adherents. “People understand Shari‘a to be rule of law, justice and rights,” says Intisar Rabb, director of the Islamic Legal Studies Program at Harvard Law School. Trump, says Rabb, has adopted Shari‘a “as a bogeyman against which he can fight and have a platform to get elected. That strikes me as very irresponsible, and it is false.” Demonizing every Muslim by equating Shari‘a and terrorism is akin to describing every Christian as a radical fundamentalist; the Bible can also be interpreted as requiring brutal punishments for archaic offenses. Meanwhile, the same Pew survey showed that majorities in every Muslim region — including the South Asian nations where support for Shari‘a runs highest — say it should apply only to Muslims. Trump often speaks of the violence perpetrated by immigrants. On the campaign trail, he likes to invoke the murders of Kate Steinle and Jamiel Shaw as examples. But studies show that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born. Or consider the Syrian refugees that Trump has moved to block. “Under the [Hillary] Clinton plan, you’d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them,” he said. In fact, refugees from countries like Syria and Iraq are the single most heavily vetted group of people that enter the country. So far in 2016, the U.S. looks poised to fall short of its modest goal of resettling the 10,000 Syrian refugees it has agreed to accept this year. About half of those entering are children, according to U.S. officials. But in a presidential campaign suffused with fears of terrorism, Trump is seizing a chance to sow suspicion — and to frame himself as uniquely positioned to make the country safer. “It’s us-against-them politics,” Roger Stone, a Republican consultant and longtime Trump adviser, told TIME in March. “You define yourself by who your enemies are.” That’s why Stone suggested without evidence on Monday that Clinton confidant Huma Abedin, who was born in Michigan to South Asian parents, might be a “Saudi spy” or a “terrorist agent.” It’s why Trump hinted that Obama himself might have unsavory connections that have altered his approach to terrorism. “Look, we’re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he’s got something else in mind,” Trump said. “There’s something going on. It’s inconceivable. There’s something going on.” Such tactics have served Trump well in a Republican primary thick with aggrieved partisan. But Republican strategists worry Trump’s strategy of division won’t work in a fall campaign where the electorate is far more diverse. “The general election is a business of addition,” says veteran GOP strategist Scott Reed. “It’s not divide-and-conquer. There aren’t enough people to divide.” — With reporting by Elizabeth Dias Write to Alex Altman at alex_altman@timemagazine.com.",2016-03-02 07:00:00,http://time.com/4367213/orlando-shooting-donald-trump-immigration-terrorism/?xid=newsletter-brief,"politics and government,united states politics and government,elections,homosexuality,islam,immigration and refugees,terrorism",4419,http://time.com
293,http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/03/how-america-is-putting-itself-back-together/426882/,"Most people in the U.S. believe their country is going to hell. But they’re wrong. What a three-year journey by single-engine plane reveals about reinvention and renewal. When news broke late last year of a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, most people in the rest of the country, and even the state, probably had to search a map to figure out where the city was. I knew exactly, having grown up in the next-door town of Redlands (where the two killers lived) and having, by chance, spent a long period earlier in the year meeting and interviewing people in the unglamorous “Inland Empire” of Southern California as part of an ongoing project of reporting across America. Some of what my wife, Deb, and I heard in San Bernardino before the shootings closely matched the picture that the nonstop news coverage presented afterward: San Bernardino as a poor, troubled town that sadly managed to combine nearly every destructive economic, political, and social trend of the country as a whole. San Bernardino went into bankruptcy in 2012 and was only beginning to emerge at the time of the shootings. Crime is high, household income is low, the downtown is nearly abandoned in the daytime and dangerous at night, and unemployment and welfare rates are persistently the worst in the state. So if you wanted a symbol of what conservative politicians like Donald Trump or Ted Cruz mean when they talk about American decay, what liberal writers like George Packer or Robert Putnam mean when describing America’s unraveling, San Bernardino would serve—and it did, in most of the reports after the shooting. But that was not the only thing, or even the most interesting thing, that we saw during our time there. If “news” is what you didn’t know before you went to look, the news of San Bernardino, from our perspective, was not the unraveling but the reverse. The familiar background was the long decline. The surprise was how wide a range of people, of different generations and races and political outlooks, believed that the city was on the upswing, and that their own efforts could help speed that trend. For instance: Last spring we met a group of San Bernardinians in their 20s and early 30s who called themselves Generation Now—San Bernardino. They were white, black, and Latino. (The city is about 60 percent Latino, 20 percent white, the rest black or Asian.) Some had finished college, some were still studying, some had not gone to college. They worked as artists or accountants or in part-time jobs. But all were involved in what you could call a raveling-up of the town’s tattered social fabric. “I was just pissed off,” an artist in his 20s named Michael Segura told us. “By the time I was old enough to vote, everything was in such terrible shape in San Bernardino. We just heard all the time that it’s a city of losers. We’d had enough.” In early 2013, just after the city declared bankruptcy and appeared to be at the depth of its hopelessness, he and a handful of friends began efforts to engage the city’s generally disaffected residents in improving their collective future. Voter-turnout rates were among the lowest in the state, especially in poor and heavily Latino precincts; Generation Now members encouraged their neighbors to show up for civic sessions and register to vote. The numerous foreclosed homes and shuttered storefronts gave great stretches of San Bernardino a war-zone look; artists in the group covered some of the buildings with murals. Other members organized park-cleanup days, removing needles and trash, and replanting bushes and grass. Soon, neighborhood kids were following them around, cleaning up alongside them. From a distance, the San Bernardino story is of wall-to-wall failure. From the inside, the story includes rapidly progressing civic and individual reinvention. One illustration is a prosperous Air Force veteran turned aerospace engineer named Mike Gallo. Five years ago, he decided to run for the board in charge of the city’s chronically troubled, low-scoring schools. Why? “These kids deserve a better chance, and we can help them get it,” he told me. It sounds formulaic, but teachers, students, and politicians said that Gallo’s hard-charging, Teddy Roosevelt–style energy and effort had helped the schools begin a turnaround. He is now the board’s president. Another illustration is his colleague Bill Clarke, who worked as a trainer and manager for General Dynamics and then had a career teaching manufacturing skills in local public schools. Five years ago, when he retired, he and Gallo set up a nonprofit technical school for unskilled locals, and intensified training programs in the public schools, whose students are mainly from poor households. In these programs, the students learn to use and repair the machinery that defines the advanced-manufacturing age: 3-D printers, robots, and enormous CNC (computer numerically controlled) machine-tool systems. “We’re training them on real machines, with real national-level certification, for good real-world jobs that really exist,” Clarke told me in the machine shop at his nonprofit school, beneath a banner saying we are making america great in manufacturing again. Since 2010, he said, more than 400 students had passed through the school “right into the high-tech manufacturing world.” This was going on in the same city that was blanketed by reporters from around the world for several weeks. They did a thorough job on one particular story in San Bernardino, but more was happening. As a whole, the country may seem to be going to hell. That jeremiad view is a great constant through American history. The sentiment is predictably and particularly strong in a presidential-election year like this one, when the “out” party always has a reason to argue that things are bad and getting worse. And plenty of objective indicators of trouble, from stagnant median wages to drug epidemics in rural America to gun deaths inflicted by law-enforcement officers and civilians, support the dystopian case. But here is what I now know about America that I didn’t know when we started these travels, and that I think almost no one would infer from the normal diet of news coverage and political discourse. The discouraging parts of the San Bernardino story are exceptional—only five other U.S. cities are officially bankrupt—but the encouraging parts have resonance almost anywhere else you look. Mike Gallo and Bill Clarke are politically conservative and, as I heard from Clarke in particular, they share the current GOP pessimism about trends for the country as a whole. But they both feel encouraged about the collaborative efforts on education reform under way right now in their own town. What is true for this very hard-luck city prevails more generally: Many people are discouraged by what they hear and read about America, but the closer they are to the action at home, the better they like what they see. What Americans have heard and read about the country since Deb and I started our travels is the familiar chronicle of stagnation and strain. The kinds of things we have seen make us believe that the real news includes a process of revival and reinvention that has largely if understandably been overlooked in the political and media concentration on the strains of this Second Gilded Age. “In scores of ways, Americans are figuring out how to take advantage of the opportunities of this era, often through bypassing or ignoring the dismal national conversation,” Phillip Zelikow, a professor at the University of Virginia and a director of a recent Markle Foundation initiative called “Rework America,” told me. “There are a lot of more positive narratives out there—but they’re lonely, and disconnected. It would make a difference to join them together, as a chorus that has a melody.”This is the alternative melody we would like to introduce. In early 2013, I placed a short item on The Atlantic’s Web site asking for advice from readers about cities of a certain type. We wanted to hear about cities whose recent dramas might reveal something about the economic and cultural resilience of the United States. I asked about cities that had suffered some kind of economic, political, environmental, or other hardship during the financial crash or earlier, and whose response was instructive in either good or bad ways. I said we were looking for “smaller” cities, by which I really meant anything less famous than the big stylish centers of the East and West Coasts. I also said that we definitely were not looking for the merely “quaint,” the kitschy touches of Americana such as the little town showcasing the world’s largest ball of twine. Nor were we looking for “undiscovered gems” or entries on a list of ideal low-budget retirement sites. Rather we hoped to treat seriously parts of flyover territory that usually made the news only after a natural or man-made disaster, or as primary-campaign or swing-state locations during presidential-election years. In the end we got more than 1,000 responses—nearly 700 within a few days!—including several hundred making an extended case for the significance of what had happened in the writer’s town. Suggestions have kept coming in. The knowledge that I cannot possibly ever see most of the places I’ve now read about makes me surprisingly sad. But we’ve been steadily visiting as many as we can. So far we have had extended, repeat-visit exposure (usually totaling 10 days to two weeks) to two dozen cities and towns all around the country, and shorter sessions in two dozen more. There is a high-toned tradition of road trips as a means of “discovering” America, from Lewis and Clark and Tocqueville through John Dos Passos, John Steinbeck, and William Least Heat Moon (whose Blue Highways made its debut in these pages). Apart from other obvious points of contrast, our project was different in that rather than going by car (or wagon, or pirogue), we’ve gone from city to city in our family’s small single-engine propeller airplane, a Cirrus SR22. This was a decision made for convenience, for beauty, and for edification. The convenience comes from the simple fact that almost any settlement in America is within close range of a place where a small airplane can land. Some 5,000 public airports, many of them built for military purposes during and after World War II, are scattered about the U.S., making many remote hamlets more easily reachable by air than by other means. The beauty comes from the privilege and unending fascination of watching the American landscape unfurl below as you travel at low altitude. At the dawn of powered flight, a century ago, it was assumed that writers and painters would want to become aviators, and vice versa—Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, and Ernest K. Gann were fliers who wrote; Beryl Markham, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and Anne Morrow Lindbergh were writers who flew—because of the unique perspective on civilization and nature offered by the aerial view. The late novelist James Salter, who was a Korean War fighter pilot and retained his passion for flight, was a mid-century example; William Langewiesche, a longtime Atlantic writer (and the son of Wolfgang Langewiesche, whose Stick and Rudder is the flying world’s equivalent of The Elements of Style) is a current one. A coast-to-coast drive across America has its tedious stretches, and the teeming interstate corridors, from I-95 in the east to I-5 in the west, can lead to the despairing conclusion that the country is made of gas stations, burger stands, and big-box malls. From only 2,500 feet higher up, the interstates look like ribbons that trace narrow paths across landscape that is mostly far beyond the reach of any road. From ground level, America is mainly road—after all, that’s where cars can take you. From the sky, America is mainly forest in the eastern third, farmland in the middle, then mountain and desert in the west, before the strip of intense development along the California coast. It’s also full of features obvious from the sky that are much harder to notice from the ground (and difficult to pick out from six miles up in an airliner): quarries at the edge of most towns, to provide gravel for roads and construction sites; prisons, instantly identifiable by their fencing (though some mega high schools can look similar), usually miles from the nearest town or tucked in locations where normal traffic won’t pass by. I never tire of the view from this height, as different from the normal, grim airliner perspective as scuba diving is from traveling on a container ship. The edification comes from lessons in history, geography, urban planning, and environmental protection and despoliation that are inescapably obvious from above. Why is St. Louis where it is? Ah, of course! It’s where the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers come together. Why were mill towns built along the fall line of the Appalachians? Because of the long north-to-south series of waterfalls. As you cross South Dakota from east to west, from the big city of Sioux Falls at the Iowa and Minnesota borders toward Rapid City and the Black Hills and beyond, you can see the terrain change sharply. In the East River portion of the state, between Sioux Falls and the Missouri, you see flat, well-watered farmlands and small farming towns. Then past Pierre you reach West River, with rough, dry badlands, some grazing cattle, and very few structures. Everyone who has looked at a map “knows” about the effect of topography and rainfall, but it means something different as it unfolds below you, like a real-world Google Earth. You can also see the history of transportation in the way towns are settled. Even in South Dakota’s fertile East River, you can easily trace from low altitude what the railroads ushered in 150 years ago, and how their impact has ebbed. As we flew along one of the east-west lines that brought settlers into these territories and carried crops out to markets, we would see little settlements every few minutes. In the 1800s they were set up at roughly 10-mile intervals, an efficient distance when farmers were delivering their harvests by wagon. Now it seems that four out of five of those towns are withering, as farms are run with giant combines and crops are hauled by truck. I would love for more people to know how this country looks from above. I would love for America’s sense of itself to include more of what we’ve seen on the ground. America is egalitarian, and snobbish. The city looks down on the countryside, the north on the south, the coastal meccas on the flyover interior—and of course each object of disdain looks back with its own reverse snobbery. A version of today’s hierarchical awareness is the concept of the “big sort.” This is the idea that if you have first-rate abilities and more than middling ambitions, you’ll need to end up in one of a handful of talent destinations. New York for finance; the San Francisco Bay Area or Seattle for tech; Washington, D.C., for politics and foreign policy. If you can make it there … This sorting is real. Through my working life, as a California patriot I have waited for the time when the news-media base would shift to the West Coast. I am waiting still. But nearly everywhere we went we were surprised by evidence of a different flow: of people with first-rate talents and ambitions who decided that someplace other than the biggest cities offered the best overall opportunities. We saw and documented examples in South Carolina, and South Dakota, and Vermont, and the central valley of California, and central Oregon. I’ll talk now about northern Minnesota and inland Southern California. Duluth, Minnesota, has become one of the country’s aerospace centers largely because the two brothers who founded Cirrus Design, Alan and Dale Klapmeier, decided that they wanted to spend their working lives amid the same Upper Midwest landscape and outdoors opportunities with which they had grown up. And now another generation of entrepreneurs is choosing Duluth. The Benson brothers, Dave and Greg, grew up in Minneapolis and went to college in the early 1990s at the University of Minnesota at Duluth. If you saw them in Southern California, you might think they were surfers—shaggy-haired, rangy, weathered. Their sports were instead the northern-plains variants: skiing, ice-skating, and skateboarding. Soon after college, in 1997, they founded (with a friend, Tony Ciardelli) a company called TrueRide, which became a successful manufacturer of ramps, half-pipes, and other ingredients of outdoor skateboard parks. They started the company in Minneapolis but moved to Duluth because it was so much more affordable. They also liked Duluth’s livable scale, and what locals consider its year-round recreational opportunities. (Year-round if you enjoy the cold: When we visited the Bensons’ manufacturing plant, a week after Memorial Day in 2014, the last ice floe on Lake Superior had just melted. But, proving the locals’ loyalty, that same week residents were outvoting people from the likes of Asheville, North Carolina, and Provo, Utah, to win Outside magazine’s online poll to choose America’s “Best Town.”) The skateboard parks that TrueRide sold were made of expensive plastic and composites. The Bensons didn’t like how much scrap was left over after they cut out the big sections for their skating ramps. They formed first a kitchenware company called Epicurean, then a furniture works called Loll, to make chairs, tables, cutting boards, and other products from the material they had been discarding. On a wooded hillside outside Duluth, some of the company’s design and manufacturing offices are housed in a building that had once been a factory producing cement burial vaults and then was closed as a hazardous brownfield site. The city and state governments agreed to help clean up the site if the Bensons based their businesses there. As you approach from the back, you think, “This is what a Depression-era burial-vault factory would look like.” Once you step inside the door, you’re in an environment that the hippest firm in San Francisco or Brooklyn would envy: recycled timber, taken from the frigid depths of Lake Superior, for the walls, staircases, and beams; other structures made of the companies’ own sleek plastic; one whole wall of glass, looking out on the woods. From this building, Loll and Epicurean ship their products to customers in 61 countries. As Dave Benson showed us around, employees went off to jog on lunch breaks; in the winter they ski or skate. Racks just inside the front door hold their sporting equipment. The Duluth area has new firms in aerospace, medical equipment, environmental tech, and other fields. “Ten years ago there weren’t many start-ups,” Dave Benson told us. “Now it’s buzzing.” If you saw this operation in San Francisco or Seattle, you would think: Of course! Where else could you combine the product-design talent that can appeal to a worldwide market, the emphasis on sustainability that has made the firm a leader in recycling techniques, and the production skills necessary to create a rapidly changing line of items? But you find it in Duluth—“because we just like the quality of life here,” Dave Benson said. And you find it in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Greenville, South Carolina; Burlington, Vermont; Louisville, Kentucky; Bend, Oregon; and Davis, California. And in larger but noncoastal cities like Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio. And in Redlands, neighbor of now-notorious San Bernardino. When I was growing up there, in the Baby Boom era, its economy rested on the orange-growing business, the neighboring Norton Air Force Base, and a medical community serving the nearby desert area. Now the orange groves are nearly gone, the Air Force base is closed, and the desert communities have their own doctors—but the city has been transformed by the presence of a tech firm that by all rights should be in some bigger, fancier place. This company, Esri, is a world leader in geographic information systems, or GIS. These are essentially the industrial-strength counterparts to Google Earth, which governments and companies around the world use for everything from tracking pothole repairs to monitoring climate change. Esri, which now has more than 10,000 employees worldwide and 2,500 in Redlands, “should have” been based somewhere near Harvard; that is where its founder, Jack Dangermond, did his original work in GIS in the late 1960s. But he and his wife, Laura, had grown up in Redlands (where I knew them), and preferred it. “We fundamentally felt more comfortable starting out, living, working, and operating our business in a place that was sort of off the grid, where we could actually get things done,” he wrote in an e-mail. Instead of going to where the tech talent pool already was, they chose where they wanted to be and recruited talent to join them there. Not every computer programmer wants to live in a less expensive, family-friendly city rather than in the Bay Area, but enough do to make the company a success. The Dangermonds still own the company, which is valued in the billions, and have taken on a role as smaller-town counterparts to Warren Buffett: personally unflashy, doing internationally successful work from an out-of-the-way location, and behind the scenes supporting the town’s philanthropies, especially conservation efforts. (Jack Dangermond’s parents, Dutch immigrants, ran a nursery in town, and his original training was in landscape architecture.) The Esri campus in Redlands, like Loll and Epicurean’s in Duluth, is just what you’d expect to find in a famous tech center, exactly where you wouldn’t expect to find it. Where you wouldn’t expect, that is, except we have seen so much of this nearly every place we’ve gone. America thinks of itself as having a few distinct islands of tech creativity; I now see it as an archipelago of start-ups and reinventions. John Dearie, a co-author (with Courtney Geduldig) of Where the Jobs Are, argues that new-business formation is the single most important guide to future employment trends. This is because of the unlikely-sounding but true economic observation that, over the decades, all the net new job growth within the U.S. economy has come from firms in their first five years of existence (and mainly from fast-growing ones in their very first year). Big, established firms—Walmart, McDonald’s—employ a lot of people. But the increase in jobs, overall, statistically comes from new firms, as they go from no employees to the first dozens or hundreds. The Kauffman Foundation annually ranks the “start-up density” of metro areas: the number of new firms divided by population size. It covers larger metro areas than most we visited, but San Francisco is not even in the top 10 of the 2015 ranking (it’s No. 12). Miami, New York City, and Orlando are the top three, followed by Austin, Denver, and Tampa. Columbus, Ohio, showed the greatest increase in start-ups from the preceding year. In 2015 both New York State and Florida made the list of top 10 states in start-up density, at Nos. 4 and 5, respectively. The rest were flyover states—North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, South Dakota, Colorado, Vermont, and Nevada. North Dakota and Wyoming might be downplayed as energy-boom outliers, but the rest reflected “normal” business growth. A great, underappreciated advantage of “everywhere else” in America: The real estate is cheap. In New York, in San Francisco, in half a dozen other cities, everything about life is slave to hyper-expensive real estate. In Sioux Falls, South Dakota; in Allentown, Pennsylvania; in inland California; across the south, costs are comparatively low. This has an effect—on how much you have to work, on what you think you need, on the risks you can take. Every calculation—the cash flow you must maintain, the life balance you can work toward—is different when a very nice family house costs a few hundred thousand dollars rather than a few million. Apart from San Bernardino, the hardest-pressed place we visited was the area of northeastern Mississippi, close to the Alabama border, that has rebranded itself as the “Golden Triangle.” This is rolling, wooded country rather than the bottomland of the delta, but it is nearly as poor. The cities that make up the triangle are Columbus, Starkville, and West Point. During the slaveholding era and afterward this was a cotton center; Columbus still has a rich endowment of antebellum homes. In modern times the region has had an economic base consisting of the campus of Mississippi State University, in Starkville; an Air Force pilot-training base outside Columbus; some catfish farms; and low-wage, low-tech factories. Nonetheless, the long-term trend was downward. A quarry and workshop in Columbus that supplied marble headstones for the military and that thrived during the Vietnam War closed. The low-wage, low-tech factories that had come to the area after World War II—a toilet-seat plant, cut-and-sew garment workshops, a meatpacking plant owned by Sara Lee that once employed 1,000 people—closed one by one. A little more than half of the 120,000 or so residents of the Golden Triangle are white; most of the rest are black. The median household income last year was about $35,000, versus about $54,000 for the country as a whole. If you wanted a vista of American hopelessness, you might think to start in Mississippi. But here again we heard that though the country as a whole was in trouble, things at home were moving in the right direction. The main economic turnaround of the region is generally traced to an organization called Golden Triangle Development Link and its leaders, a white man from Arkansas named Joe Max Higgins and a black woman from Mississippi named Brenda Lathan. Over the past decade they have negotiated, cajoled, and otherwise persuaded a series of international manufacturing firms to build new factories in an industrial zone surrounding the new Golden Triangle airport, equidistant from the three cities. What is remarkable is less the details of the negotiations than the sense and pace of progress, in yet another corner of America where you’d hardly expect it. When we first visited early last year, Joe Max Higgins took us to the most modern “mini-mill” for producing steel in North America, in the Golden Triangle industrial zone. This “mini” structure is what most lay observers would consider to be unimaginably vast. Ladles that appeared to be the size of 747s transported burbling loads of molten metal. The cooling line for the endless stream of new sheet metal stretched thousands of feet, under one roof. Mountains of scrap metal, from recycling shops and auto junkyards, sat outside the mill, raw material for the new steel to be made inside. This was the closest I have come in the United States to the experience of major factory life in China—and it was in rural Mississippi, where a racially mixed workforce of almost 700 earned a median wage of more than $80,000. A Russian-owned company invested more than $1.5 billion to build this plant starting in 2005. Steel Dynamics, based in Indiana, bought it two years ago and is expanding production. Now it is only one of several major high-wage manufacturers in the area. Several times over the past three years, Deb and I have flown, low, over the factories of the Golden Triangle. They look as if they were laid out in an instructive diorama. Near the older, smaller Lowndes County airport in Columbus are the all-but-abandoned toilet-seat works, the shut-down garment factories, the headstone works, and other sad-looking remnants of an old economy. Ten miles west, a few minutes’ flight, is the large, modern runway of the Golden Triangle commercial airport, with the sprawling steelworks on one side, and helicopter and truck-engine plants nearby. A few minutes to the north, just past some catfish farms and cattle-grazing land, is a scene of industrial ruin: the derelict Sara Lee meatpacking plant in West Point, which was being picked apart by wreckers on our first visit early last year. When we flew over the same area again three months ago, a $300 million Yokohama Tires factory had just opened, with the company’s most modern production facilities in the world. Almost every place we went, the changes in America’s ethnic makeup were obvious. Almost no place did this come up as an economic, cultural, or political emergency, or even as the most pressing local issue. Based on everything we could see, the problems of immigration that presidential candidates have seized on for political advantage were largely another “rest of America” problem. That is, people generally saw things as manageable or improving locally, but believed they were falling apart everyplace else. In 2014, a nationwide Gallup poll found that immigration had “modestly below-average importance to registered voters”; on a list of 15 challenges facing the nation, it came in at No. 9. In 2015, Gallup found that 65 percent of Americans thought levels of immigration should stay the same—or go up. In California, the state most dramatically affected by immigration, a 2015 poll reported that 59 percent of voters viewed immigration as a “positive force.” If you hadn’t heard the speeches and read the stories about an immigration-driven crisis in America, you might conclude city by city that the American assimilation machine was still functioning. We saw this shift all around the country: older people whiter, younger people darker. One version of what happens next is familiar to anyone who’s ever read a newspaper. Richer, whiter people think that public schools, public places, center cities are no longer for “people like us” and withdraw themselves, their children, and their tax support to the suburbs or private schools. We did see cases of that. But we also saw the opposite. One example: The little town of Holland, Michigan, got its name because so many Dutch people congregated there. A generation ago, its population was overwhelmingly white, mainly Dutch, and generally affiliated with sects of the conservative Dutch Reformed Church. In high-school graduation photos from the 1970s, nearly all the faces are of blue-eyed blondes. Since then, Michigan’s surprisingly important agricultural industry, including a large Heinz pickle factory right in downtown Holland, has drawn a substantial Latin American population, and strong Holland-area manufacturing and design companies have drawn immigrants from around the world. By 2005 the public-school population in this famously white town was mainly nonwhite. In 2010 the superintendent of Holland’s public schools, Brian Davis, who grew up in a white farming family in Michigan, began a campaign to get major new bond funding for the schools. This was in the depth of the financial collapse, in a hard-hit state, in the same election cycle in which the Tea Party made its debut—and Davis was asking a mainly white electorate, most of whom did not have children in the public schools, to refinance the schools. And they did. The new programs and facilities paid for by the bond, according to Davis, helped reverse a decline in public confidence in the schools. “We have children who come from homes with $1 million–plus annual income, and ones who come from homes with incomes under $20,000,” Davis told me in 2013. “Just under 10 percent of them are considered homeless.” He reeled off some of the 20 native languages of his students. “Of course Spanish, but then Japanese, Russian, Tagalog, Korean. We’ve got more Garcias than Vans”—Van being the shorthand for standard Dutch names. “We’re what the future of public education looks like.” This is the reality as we heard it in many other cities. Another example: Sioux Falls, South Dakota. It would be easy to take this city as an example of the ways in which American ethnicity is not changing. Sioux Falls is nearly 90 percent white. But a very noticeable part of the Sioux Falls street scene are people who obviously did not come from Spearfish, or Bismarck, or the other farming towns of the Great Plains. Some are American Indians from Pine Ridge or other reservations; some are Latino or Asian migrants as in any other city; but a substantial number are Somalis, Sudanese, or people from Nepal or Burma or other sites of recent turmoil. The U.S. State Department manages the resettlement of refugees across the country, working mainly with religious groups. Sioux Falls, despite being relatively “nondiverse” and remote, is a city with one of the best records of absorbing refugees (Burlington, Vermont, is another). The civic and business leaders of Sioux Falls we spoke with, most of them white, seemed proud rather than beleaguered about their city’s new role as a melting pot. As always, there were problems and challenges. Refugees from Sudan and Somalia had to be instructed not to offer bribes if stopped by the police—and the police had to be told not to throw the book at the refugees. A boy from Africa had never used an indoor toilet and had to be shown how. Sioux Falls is reviving its downtown district, but most of the area is laid out in typical freeway-era American sprawl. Many refugees don’t have cars (or can’t drive), and they can’t rely on the shaky public-bus system. So on hot days in the summer and very cold winter nights, you can see groups of Somalis or Sudanese trudging along the roadways to and from their jobs at factories or shopping malls. The most dramatic display of this era’s assimilation process is at a huge pig slaughterhouse, one of the dominant features of downtown Sioux Falls’ cityscape. The plant was set up in the early 1900s by the John Morrell company; for many years it was the city’s largest employer, and it still employs more than 3,000 people; eventually it was sold to Smithfield and in 2013 to the Chinese firm Shuanghui (which hoped that American-raised and -processed meat would be popular among Chinese customers wary of tainted-food scandals). Through the 20th century, the Morrell plant was a site of representative struggles in American society: the violent efforts to unionize the workforce in the 1930s and the corporate efforts to de-unionize it in the 1980s, as wave after wave of newcomers arrived from overseas or farm towns to work “at Morrell’s” as their entrée to urban life. University professors, bankers, newspaper reporters, and tech workers in Sioux Falls told me that their families had first moved to the city to work at the plant. The workers at the slaughterhouse are now largely immigrants and refugees. The safety and work-rules instructions are posted in 30 languages. The workers on the line, cutting up pig carcasses, include Muslim women from Sudan or Somalia, saving money to send their children to college. Deb met two young sisters from Darfur, one of whom was in high school and had joined ROTC there. Her main regret was that she was not allowed to wear her ROTC uniform to school on dress days, because ROTC rules forbade wearing the uniform with a head scarf. (Yarmulkes were acceptable, since they fit under the uniform cap.) We heard a few months later that the rule had been waived. The young woman wore her ROTC uniform, with her head scarf, to school. I am a philistine, who has not really cared about the state of the arts. Give me research centers and “makerspaces” with 3‑D printers, plus a factory or two, and I’ll tell you how I feel about a town. Perhaps the topic on which I’ve most changed my mind through our travels concerns the civic importance of local arts, and the energy being devoted to them across the country. Almost every place we visited offers an example: Bend, Oregon, whose Art in Public Places project has installed large sculptures at 20 traffic roundabouts; Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which has converted the ruins of a Bethlehem Steel plant into a concert center and arts space; Riverside, California, with life-size sculptures of prominent leaders of all ethnicities throughout its new downtown mall; Rapid City, South Dakota (the closest city to Mount Rushmore), with its life-size sculptures of all the American presidents spaced throughout its downtown; Winters, California, with its springtime Plein Air Festival, for which it invites artists to visit and portray the area in paintings, sculpture, or photographs. Three examples of what is happening elsewhere are in the largish city of Pittsburgh; the smallish city of Fresno, California; and the tiny town of Ajo, Arizona. Pittsburgh’s late-20th-century transformation from dirty, dying steel center to chic tech hub is probably the best-known American turnaround story. Parts of it are instructive for cities elsewhere, notably the emphasis on universities as centers of new-tech growth. Parts are unique. “Pittsburgh feels as vibrant as it does—museums, opera, restaurants, but not much traffic—because we’re living in an infrastructure built for twice as many people as live here now,” Dutch MacDonald, the CEO of the design firm Maya, told me. That is exactly the formula that led to devastation in Detroit: lots of space and buildings, not enough people. In Pittsburgh, by all accounts, the difference is the extraordinary density of rich, locally rooted philanthropies set up by the titans of the robber-baron era and still committed to the city’s development. The Mellon, Heinz, Carnegie, Frick, and other charities support Pittsburgh institutions in a way any city would envy but few can imitate. The arts initiative that struck us in Pittsburgh was bottom-up and frugally operated, rather than a big foundation project. It is known as the City of Asylum project, and its goal is to revive a run-down area of Pittsburgh and make it a haven for persecuted writers from the rest of the world. In the 1990s Henry Reese, the founder of local telemarketing and coupon-book firms, and his wife, an artist named Diane Samuels, became interested in the cause of oppressed novelists, poets, and journalists. By 2004, they had organized and opened the only independently funded U.S. branch of the City of Asylum movement, which was already strong in Europe. (There are two other such cities in the United States, but they are run by universities; Pittsburgh’s is on its own.) They put up some of their own money, and ran fund-raisers and recruited donors for more, so they could buy a series of rowhouses in the once-seedy Mexican War Streets district of Pittsburgh (the streets are named for battles and generals from that war) for their writers and artists to stay for periods of months or years. One of the first was a long-imprisoned dissident poet from China. He decided to turn his house into public art, covering it with poems in large Chinese characters. A Burmese writer and her family came, and painted the exterior of their house with landscapes and “dreamscapes.” Strolling down the streets is like being in a graffiti-covered part of town, but one where the style, palette, and theme vary building by building, and the decorations have been done carefully and proudly rather than on the fly. The program has steadily expanded, still locally funded; in the past decade more than 250 poets, writers, musicians, and artists from around the world have put on public performances in Pittsburgh. They have, through the arts, enhanced the city’s international reputation and, more important, given it an expanded conception of itself. Plus, the Mexican War Streets district has become a tourist draw. In Fresno, Heather Parish, the publicity director of a successful arts festival called the Rogue, said that cheap real estate would be the basis for the city’s artistic future. “Fresno is the bohemia of California,” she told us when we visited. “That’s because you can afford to live here! And the pace of life is such that you can have a full-time job if you need to, but not be so stressed out or have the 90-minute commutes of L.A. You can afford the garage as your studio, if you need it, which you can’t do in San Jose anymore.” Of all the cities we visited, my mind changed most about Fresno—in part because I’d heard about it all my life as one of California’s least hip cities, and in part because of the spark that the Rogue festival brought to the businesses in the artsy Tower District. Last February, on the opening evening of the 2015 Rogue, the capacity crowd filing into the restored Tower Theater passed belly dancers, men on stilts, fire-breathers, mimes, and acrobats; inside they saw strictly timed two-minute performances by more than two dozen dramatic, musical, and stand-up-comedy artists who would be part of the festival. Nothing about it said small-town talent show. Instead it said, “There is more going on, in more places, than you imagined.” The tiny-town example is Ajo, far south of Phoenix. Ajo’s economic existence, like the Carnegie-era version of Pittsburgh’s, once depended on heavy industry. In the early 1900s, a mining company decided to exploit a major high-grade copper deposit in Ajo, where Spaniards, Mexicans, and American Indians had dug small mines for many years. From the opening of the company’s mine and an adjoining rail line just before World War I until a bitter labor dispute in 1985 that led to the mine’s closure, everything about the town depended on the copper business. The ugly remnants of those days are a vast crater, more than 1,000 feet deep and a mile across, and a mountain of mine tailings visible from 25 miles away. But the people running the mine had cultural and artistic ambitions, and they left a beautiful legacy as well. The manager, John Greenway, was a Yale graduate and a Rough Rider at San Juan Hill with Teddy Roosevelt. His wife, Isabella, was a lifelong friend of Eleanor Roosevelt. A century ago the Greenways laid out an elegant, expansive plaza that would be admired in any Spanish town, and a comparably stately school. They lived in a white-stucco-walled, red-tile-roofed house on the highest point in the town. From there you can look, and I did, down on the lovely formal architecture of the town center, with the white-stucco arcades, under red-tile roofs, of the plaza that the Greenways built. When I first saw the plaza last year and imagined the remoteness of Ajo when it was built, I thought of the grand opera house that rubber tycoons had built in the Brazilian jungle, in Manaus. For years Ajo eked out an existence from what Gabrielle David, the editor of Ajo Copper News, called “blue-collar retirees,” who came in RVs or with tents to stretch pensions as far as they could go. Ajo is the closest town to the spectacular Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, which we decided was given that name only because another reserve was already called Saguaro National Park. The dominant plant in Organ Pipe is the towering, stately saguaro, with shorter, multibranch clumps of (aptly named) organ-pipe cacti in between. But most of the park was closed after drug gangs murdered a park ranger in 2002; it reopened, drawing visitors, only recently. In 1992 a woman named Tracy Taft, who had once taught philosophy at Bryn Mawr College and had then been a community organizer in the Northeast, visited Ajo and was so struck by the austere beauty of the Sonoran desert that she bought a house that same day. She moved there to live in 2000, and in a collaborative process that resembles what we have seen elsewhere, she has raised money, enlisted allies, become part of nationwide city-improvement networks, and used her city’s potential as an arts center as the basis for its economic revitalization. Taft is now the executive director of the International Sonoran Desert Alliance. It has collected government and foundation grants and investments to turn the “good bones” of Ajo’s architecture into an arts community and destination resort. First it renovated the stately Curley School, converting it into affordable-rent apartments for painters, sculptors, photographers, and others. Then the alliance remodeled the downtown plaza, which is a mixture of still-shuttered storefronts and occupied restaurants, shops, and public offices. Last year it opened the Sonoran Desert Conference Center in former schoolrooms redone in a hip style. This is designed to attract conference traffic and host “tri-national” events involving the United States, Mexico, and the nearby native Tohono O’odham Nation. “We saw artists revitalizing urban inner cities and wondered if we could make it happen intentionally in a small town,” Taft told us. The city’s vitality now comes from determined use of the arts. Everywhere we went, Deb and I saw the imprint of the great national efforts of the past. An astonishing amount of the public architecture of 21st-century America was laid down in a few Depression-era years in the 1930s, by the millions of people employed by the Works Progress Administration. The small airports we landed at were the result of mid-century defense-and-transportation building projects, as were the interstates we flew above. The grid-pattern fields of the farmland Midwest had been laid out by the rules of settlement from the earliest days of the republic. The practices that made them the most productive farmland in the world were crucially spurred by land-grant universities and agricultural-research schools. The wildlands and ecosystems that have escaped development did so because of their protection as national parks or monuments. To seize the opportunities, and cope with the failures, of this moment in American history, national efforts of the kind that more recently underlay the creation of the Internet, the GPS network, and DNA decoding might again be best. But for now, even if most parts of the complex American “system” work better than their counterparts in the rest of the world, our national politics works worse. Thus the United States has a harder time taking the steps that would make adjusting to this era less painful and more productive. As the technological and economic imperatives pushing toward a “gig economy” erode the protections of the corporate-employment model—more side income via Uber and Etsy, fewer guaranteed pensions or health benefits—national policy could respond, as it did more than a century ago when the industrial age eroded the protections of the family-farming era. Then, the response took the form of safety legislation, child-labor laws, union rights, and the minimum wage. Now it could take the form of extensions of health-care coverage and other safeguards harder to obtain without career-long jobs. Technology-friendly economists like Laura Tyson, of UC Berkeley, and Lenny Mendonca, of McKinsey, have laid out just such programs. As automation and world trade eliminate, or immiserate, some of today’s jobs, schools can help prepare students for other kinds—as happened a century ago with the creation of high schools and then again after World War II with the GI Bill. But that won’t happen soon. Whichever party wins the presidency, the other will hold enough of the Congress to make comprehensive measures of any sort very hard to push through. That is why local resilience and adaptability of the kind we have witnessed deserve nationwide attention. It’s now commonplace to observe that the United States is living through a Second Gilded Age. The distortions of that first age—the extremes of wealth and welfare, the sudden dislocations due to technology and trade and ethnic change, the dismay about corrupt and plutocratic politics, the shunting of populist concerns toward racist outbursts—all have their clear counterparts now. Sadly, history is not so mechanistic that we can say: Things turned out all right the last time around, so let’s wait for the reforms to happen again. But when we think about the shift from the original Gilded Age, in the late 19th century, to what came after, three elements can show us what to anticipate and what to seize on right now. The first, unpredictable element is the national shock that galvanizes effort. For me the central document in American political psychology is William James’s 1910 essay “The Moral Equivalent of War.” America is capable of almost anything when threatened militarily, James argued; think what it could do if it could muster the same determination without the threat. The sin of commission for the United States after its greatest recent shock, the 9/11 attacks, was the invasion of Iraq, with the consequences it will entail through the decades. The sin of omission may have been worse, to miss the opportunity for real national improvement. Consider how Dwight Eisenhower used the then-terrifying “Sputnik shock” of the late 1950s: mainly as a spur to technological and educational investment. The second element is one that Paul Starr, of Princeton University, stresses in a 2015 American Prospect essay called “How Gilded Ages End.” Democracy, he argues, finally depends on and is defined by the ability of political power to control strictly economic forces. Otherwise you’re talking about a nationwide corporation, not a country. American history of the era that began with J. P. Morgan and ran through the New Deal was about political power reasserting its preeminence. “Behind the myriad of specific reforms” that constituted the early-20th-century Progressive movement, Starr writes, “was a common recognition—a collective revulsion against the privileges of great wealth allied with great power.” He argues that the country is due for such an adjustment again. Through the past generation-plus, this struggle has been cast as a Republican-versus-Democratic issue. From Nixon onward, the modern GOP has channeled resentment about intellectual and cultural elites, and racial minorities, into support for the business elite. Thus white voters in West Virginia or Kansas support tax policies that disproportionately benefit financiers in New York and San Francisco. Despite their obvious differences, the discontents propelling Donald Trump’s campaign and that of Bernie Sanders could signal a change. And the third element that marked the end of the first Gilded Age was fertile experimentation with new approaches and possibilities. Louis Brandeis’s famous claim that the American states, rather than the central government, were the real “laboratories of democracy” came in a Supreme Court ruling in 1932. For several decades before that, states and cities across the country had experimented with new school systems, new tax and spending schemes, new ways of providing public services, new public-health programs, new regulatory approaches, all toward the goal of responding to the crises of that age. “In Cleveland, Toledo, across the Midwest and plains states, you saw these dedicated reformers,” Michael Kazin of Georgetown University, a historian of the Progressive era and a biographer of William Jennings Bryan, told me. “Some were Socialists, some Democrats, some Republicans—they were all trying something new.” One of Bryan’s goals, Kazin said, was to let the politically disparate but actively experimental reformers in one state know about parallel efforts elsewhere. When the national mood after the first Gilded Age favored reform, possibilities that had been tested, refined, and made to work in various “laboratories of democracy” were at hand. After our current Gilded Age, the national mood will change again. When it does, a new set of ideas and plans will be at hand. We’ve seen them being tested in places we never would have suspected, by people who would never join forces in the national capital. But their projects, the progress they have made, and their goals are more congruent than even they would ever imagine. Until the country’s mood does change, the people who have been reweaving the national fabric will be more effective if they realize how many other people are working toward the same end.",2016-02-10 03:33:26,Can America Put Itself Back Together?,airlines and airplanes,1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

          / CBS News President Obama on Thursday evening slammed the National Rifle Association for rejecting opportunities to discuss gun violence with him. He also accused the powerful gun lobby group for purveying the myth that he's interested in taking away Americans' guns. ""We have invited them repeatedly, but if you listen to the rhetoric, it is so over the top, and so overheated,"" the president said during a town hall event sponsored by CNN. ""I'm happy to talk to them, but, the conversation has to be based on facts and truth, and what we're actually proposing, not some -- you know, imaginary fiction in which Obama's trying to take away your guns."" Mr. Obama noted that gun sales in the U.S. typically spike whenever he introduces a new rule regarding guns, or whenever there's a mass shooting. ""Part of the reason is that the NRA has convinced many of its members that somebody's going to come grab your guns, which is by the way, really profitable for the gun manufacturers,"" he said. The president ranted that the idea is obviously nothing more than a conspiracy theory. ""The notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law... Yes, that is a conspiracy! I would hope that would agree with that,"" he said. ""Look, I mean, I'm only going to be here for another year.  I don't know -- when would I have started on this enterprise, right?"" The conspiracy theory is circulated, he said, ""for either political reasons or commercial reasons in order to prevent a coming-together among people of goodwill to develop commonsense rules that will make us safer while preserving the Second Amendment."" The president used the event to defend and explain the series of executive actions he announced earlier in the week in an attempt to reduce gun violence. Some have argued that his plan to make background checks for gun purchases more robust won't stop gun violence, since a small percentage of criminals purchase guns at gun shows. The president responded that those criminals illegally purchase weapons from others who should've been subject to background checks. In Chicago, he said, ""about 30 percent, 40 percent of those guns are coming from Indiana across the border, where there are much laxer laws, and so folks will go to a gun show and purchase a whole bunch of firearms, put them in a van, drive up [to] the South Side of Chicago... open up the trunk, and those things are for sale."" ""Now, technically, you could say those folks bought them illegally,"" je continued, ""but it was facilitated by the fact that what used to be a small exception that said collectors and hobbyists don't need to go through a background check has become this massive industry."" Mr. Obama also addressed the issue of gun violence in a New York Times op-ed Thursday. ""Even as I continue to take every action possible as president, I will also take every action I can as a citizen,"" he wrote. ""I will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform."" While the candidates running for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination all support gun reform policies, the Republican candidates have rejected the president's approach. Also on Thursday night, GOP front runner Donald Trump promised to eliminate all gun-free zones, like schools and military bases.

          / CBS News President Obama said Monday he will begin rolling out initiatives to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands over the next several days and that every recommendation made by members of his cabinet are ""well within my legal authority."" The president's remarks came after a meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch -- who was developing recommendations for potential ways he could use his executive authority -- along with FBI Director James Comey, White House staff, and the deputy director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""It is my strong belief that for us to get our complete arms around the problem Congress needs to act,"" the president said. But in the meantime, he has requested that his team ""see what more we can do to strengthen our enforcement and prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands."" ""We'll be making sure that people have a very clear understanding of what can make a difference and what we can do,"" the president said, but he added, ""We have to be very clear that this is not going to solve every violent crime in this country, it's not going to prevent every mass shooting, it's not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal."" He said the actions will potentially save lives and spare families some of the pain and loss they have felt from losing a loved one to gun violence. The president said he was confident that the recommendations ""are ones that are entirely consistent with the Second Amendment and people's lawful right to bear arms."" ""We've been very careful recognizing that although we have a strong tradition of gun ownership in this country that even those who possess firearms for hunting, for self protection and for other legitimate reasons want to make sure that the wrong people don't have them for the wrong reasons,"" he said. Mr. Obama will participate in a town hall on gun violence with CNN's Anderson Cooper this Thursday at 8 p.m. He is also meeting Monday with members of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. All of the task force's vice chairs, who are Democrats, have been invited. The president's actions are already facing stiff opposition from Republicans. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said Monday that the president's forthcoming actions were a ""dangerous level of executive overreach."" Several GOP presidential candidates have pledged to undo them if they are elected president. In early October, shortly after the mass shooting at an Oregon community college, the president assigned White House and Department of Justice lawyers to comb the law in search of any unused administrative authority available to him. One proposal under consideration: make a clear distinction between gun collectors and gun sellers. Under current law, background checks are required for anyone buying a firearm from someone ""engaged in the business"" of selling guns (like a federally-permitted gun store or dealer). Sales made out of a person's private collection, many of which are done online, are not subject to background checks. The president could order a threshold be established such that anyone selling a certain number of guns annually would no longer qualify as a collector, but as someone ""in the business"" of firearm sales. Those buyers would then be subject to background checks. Adopting this proposal would not eliminate the so-called ""gun show loophole,"" but gun control advocates argue it would be easier to prosecute offenders if the gun seller law is better defined. Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group backed by Michael Bloomberg, has also recommended better reporting and tracking of lost and stolen guns. It is unclear whether that will be included in the president's executive action. In the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre that left 20 six-year olds dead, the president mounted a legislative push to enact tighter gun laws. That effort -- which would have resulted in more far-reaching gun safety laws than any executive action -- failed in Congress. The White House recognizes the bleak political realities of another legislative push in an election year. President Obama said in July that he has been ""most frustrated and most stymied"" by the country's inability to enact ""sufficient, common sense gun safety laws."" The Obama family returns from their Hawaiian vacation this weekend. The president will deliver his final State of the Union address on January 12th.

Ron Paul (R-TX), also former candidate for the presidency, said he is for “gun control where the real killing is going on” and named the U.S. military for “going overseas and bombing and killing and starting wars that aren’t necessary.” Paul said, “Well, I still believe in the Constitution, and I believe in the Second Amendment, but I’m for gun control where the real killing is going on—is our guns and our military going overseas and bombing and killing and starting wars that aren’t necessary and selling weapons. We’re selling—we’re putting weapons in the hands of ISIS, you know, in Syria. Those are the real guns of war that we should be dealing with. And, of course, if we’re really worried about guns on the streets, why has it been totally ignored? A lot more people are dying in our inner cities. Crime on weekends is just out of control so we need more, you know, police activity to try to protect some people, but property management, that is preventing the rights of an individual to own a piece of property, whether it’s a knife or a gun, is protected, and that shouldn’t be the issue.

          / CBS News President Obama on Tuesday urged the country to tackle gun violence with more urgency, saying that executive actions won't undo the last mass shooting but can help stop the next one. ""We do have to feel a sense of urgency about it,"" the president said. ""People are dying and the constant excuses for inaction no longer do."" In an emotional speech that lasted nearly 40 minutes, the president several times invoked mass shootings that have taken place in the last two decades, with special attention to the ""too many"" that had led him to address the nation during his presidency. He wiped tears from his eyes as he recalled the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 children and six teachers dead. ""Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,"" he said. The executive actions he outlined Tuesday will expand background checks during gun sales, beef up enforcement of existing gun laws, try to improve care for the mentally ill and information-sharing to prevent them from buying guns, and boost gun safety technology. ""Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying? I reject that thinking,"" Mr. Obama said. ""We know we can't stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence."" Much of his speech was aimed at Republican lawmakers and the National Rife Association, who he blamed for consistently blocking legislation he said would have made Americans safer. ""The gun lobby may be holding congress hostage right now but they cannot hold America hostage. We do not have to accept this carnage as the price of freedom,"" Mr. Obama said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said the president had never respected the Second Amendment and that his speech and his actions ""amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty."" ""No matter what President Obama says, his word does not trump the Second Amendment. We will conduct vigilant oversight. His executive order will no doubt be challenged in the courts. Ultimately, everything the president has done can be overturned by a Republican president, which is another reason we must win in November,"" Ryan said. Several GOP presidential candidates have already pledged to undo the executive actions if they are elected in 2016. To lawmakers who only call for improvements to the mental health system in the wake of a mass shooting perpetrated by someone with an illness, the president said, ""Here's your chance to support these efforts, put your money where your mouth is."" His administration is also proposing a new $500 million investment to expand mental health treatment across the country. He told Americans, ""The reason Congress blocks laws is because they want to win elections and if you make it hard for them to win an election if they block those laws, they'll change course, I promise you."" The administration announced Monday that it would unilaterally attempt to close the so-called ""gun show loophole"" that allows gun dealers conducting business at gun shows or online without conducting background checks. Existing law exempts gun collectors and hobbyists from conducting a background check before selling a firearm. However, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said to reporters Monday, ""There's been an expansion of people claiming the exemption... when they really don't qualify for it."" The new guidance from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) announced Monday ""puts in one place clear guidance... on who actually qualifies as a dealer,"" Lynch said. ""It will help individuals who do want to comply and really do want to know the standards, and it will also put everyone else on notice that if they don't comply, there will be consequences."" The new ATF guidance and stepped up enforcement efforts were announced with a series of other executive actions the administration is taking as part of an ongoing effort to reduce gun violence. Though the president has been clear that the move is motivated by Congress' inaction on any further gun control legislation, he said after meeting with Lynch Monday that the new actions are ""well within my legal authority."" The president was introduced by Mark Barden, whose son, Daniel, was among the children killed in Newtown, Connecticut . He is now the managing director at Sandy Hook Promise, the nonprofit organization run by several families affected by the shooting that aims to reduce gun violence. The president was also accompanied by the widow of State Sen. Clementa Pinckney, the pastor at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church who was killed in a shooting at the Charleston, South Carolina church earlier thsi year. Shortly after the mass shooting at an Oregon community college in early October, the president assigned White House and Department of Justice lawyers to comb the law in search of any unused administrative authority available to him. Lynch insisted Monday that the new guidance on the gun show loophole sets ""clear, definitive standards"" for anyone who wants to sell firearms. However, the new guidance does not include a specific number of guns that must be sold to qualify as a dealer, since existing law does not specify a number. However, court rulings have set a precedent that says a person could sell as few as one or two guns and still be considered a dealer, depending on the circumstances. For instance, Lynch explained, if an individual sells a gun clearly for profit, or if they buy and sell a gun kept in its original packaging, they may be considered a dealer. ""It's important to note the hobbyist and collector exception is still there,"" she said. Now, though, dealers can no longer ""hide behind that."" The ATF will engage in a ""business educational initiative"" in the first part of 2016, Lynch said, to help gun dealers, hobbyists and collectors understand the new guidance. This effort will target gun shows, flea markets and online dealers. Lynch added, ""We will be looking for those individuals who seek to avoid registering."" She added that the ATF is ramping up its enforcement efforts, particularly online. ""If it does stop one act of violence, this effort will be worth it,"" she said. To improve enforcement, the FBI aims to start processing background checks 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It also aims to improve its notification to local authorities when someone unlawfully attempts to buy a gun. The FBI wants to hire more than 230 additional examiners but eventually automate the background check process, administration officials explained Monday. To beef up the information in the federal background check system, the administration is also reaching out to state leaders. Lynch sent a letter to all 50 governors, highlighting the importance of receiving complete criminal history records for the system. Additionally, the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) is notifying states that it can enter mental health information into the system without running afoul of privacy laws. A CBS News poll taken in December found that concerns about mass shootings has not increased support for stricter gun laws: the percentage favoring stricter laws has dropped slightly since October. Now 51 percent of Americans think gun laws should be stricter, down from 58 percent. Most Democrats (76 percent) and half of independents (51 percent) think gun laws should be stricter, while most Republicans (59 percent) think they should be kept as they are. Most Americans who do not own guns also think gun laws should be stricter (64 percent), while most who own guns think they should be kept as they are (50 percent) or made less strict (17 percent). Fifty percent of Americans think stricter gun laws will help at least somewhat to reduce gun violence, while nearly as many - 48 percent - don't think stricter laws will help much. There is greater support for better mental health screening: More than three in four Americans think better mental health screening would help to prevent gun violence, including 45 percent who think it would help a lot.

          / CBS News By this time next year, President Obama's successor will have been elected, but before he goes, he still has things he intends to finish in the remaining 12 months of his presidency. ""We think the lame duck moniker is dead,"" a senior administration official told CBS News. Another official told CBS that the president has instructed his senior staff to ""squeeze every last drop of progress out of the final year."" The president will fight to preserve gains in areas including ""access to affordable health care, expanding the green economy, implementing the Iran deal"" and continuing the normalization of relations with Cuba,"" the official said. Here's where he may make some progress: With some of Congress' most liberal and conservative members working together reform the nation's sentencing laws, criminal justice reform stands a decent chance at becoming law. In October, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation that would make some nonviolent drug offenders eligible for reduced sentences and give judges more discretion in sentencing. A similar, but less ambitious bill is making its way through the House. At his year-end news conference, the president told reporters he's ""optimistic"" the legislation can make a difference if the two chambers can merge their bills into a law he can sign. The measure, he argues, will save money and reduce recidivism, while making sure that people who make a mistake by committing nonviolent crimes still pay a price and serve their time. Mr. Obama broke with many members of his own party this year when he asked Congress for authority to fast-track a massive Asia-Pacific free trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). He had allies among the GOP, and their votes helped him secure  Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which will help speed the trade deal through Congress. The president could sign the deal with the other nations that are participating as soon as Feb. 4. Then, an economic review will be submitted to Congress, where the relevant committees, followed by the full House and Senate, will consider the deal. Mr. Obama has called the agreement ""the most pro-labor, pro-environment, progressive trade deal in history, that eliminates just about every tariff on American manufacturing goods."" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, helped usher TPA through Congress and has argued that the U.S. should be writing the rules on trade agreements. But he hasn't said if or when Congress will vote on the agreement. ""TPP has great potential,"" Ryan told the Wall Street Journal CEO Council in October, ""but we want to scrub this trade agreement to make sure that it reaches and meets the standards that we call for in TPA."" Even with Republican help, the president will face opposition from Democrats. All three Democratic presidential candidates oppose the trade deal, as does Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts. After months of legal review, the White House is expected to unveil executive measures aimed at reducing gun violence, as soon as early next week. The president himself announced that the review period is now coming to an end. ""A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence. And on Monday, I'll meet with our Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options,"" he said, in his weekly radio address, released on New Year's day. In early October, after the mass shooting at an Oregon community college, President Obama assigned White House and Justice Department lawyers to comb the law in search of any unused administrative authority available to him, given congressional inaction on guns. One proposal under consideration: separate the gun collectors from the gun sellers. Under current law, background checks are required for anyone buying a firearm from someone ""engaged in the business"" of selling guns (like a federally-permitted gun store or dealer). Sales made out of a person's private collection, many of which are done online, are not subject to background checks. The president could order a threshold be established such that anyone selling a certain number of guns annually would no longer qualify as a collector, but as someone ""in the business"" of firearm sales. Those buyers would then be subject to background checks. Closing Gitmo is a pledge that dates back to Mr. Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. But congressional opposition remains, and some of the president's former advisers are urging him to use his executive authority to transfer prisoners to the U.S. for detention or trial. Currently, 107 prisoners remain at Guantanamo. First, the president said he's going to take one last shot at presenting a plan to Congress to close it. But he admits that ""it's fair to say that there's going to be significant resistance from some quarters."" He's making a financial argument that ""it doesn't make sense for us to be spending an extra $100 million, $200 million, $300 million, $500 million, a billion dollars, to have a secure setting for 50, 60, 70 people."" Beyond the cost, the president has long argued that the prison fuels the propaganda of terror groups. Two of his former aides have argued that Article II of the Constitution gives the president exclusive authority to decide where U.S. military detainees are held. But other scholars argue that since Congress has explicitly banned Mr. Obama from transferring detainees to the U.S., any executive action to do so would be unconstitutional. Mr. Obama says he thinks a Democrat will succeed him. ""And I will campaign very hard to make that happen -- for a whole variety of reasons -- because they're far more likely to share my fundamental vision about where America should go."" Campaigning would be a departure from the 2014 midterms. Wary of President Obama's low approval ratings heading into the midterm elections, the White House limited his exposure on the campaign trail. Mr. Obama stuck to the blue states where he was more likely to help rather than hurt. Still, five of the nine candidates he campaigned with leading up to Election Day lost their races. This time, the White House isn't holding back. ""I do think the president will be active on the campaign trail. The president has expressed confidence that a Democrat will succeed him in office. But he's not naive to know that that's gonna take a lot of work,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told CBS' Chip Reid. ""I would definitely expect the president to be out there campaigning."" Asked whether the president is popular enough to be out on the campaign trail, Schultz said, ""I sure think so.""

Friday, 05 February 2016 01:35 PM Although Obama's stake is minuscule, worth no more than $30, it reflects a much larger surge of investment. The president is among millions of Americans buying into gun companies — often unwittingly — as mutual funds have increased such holdings to record levels, according to a Reuters analysis of institutional investment in firearms companies. Since Obama was elected in 2009, mutual funds have raised their stakes to about $510 million from $30 million in the nation's two largest gun manufacturers with publicly traded shares, Smith & Wesson Corp and Sturm, Ruger & Co. That means such stocks are now common in retirement and college savings plans. The influx has helped to boost both companies' shares by more than 750 percent during the Obama presidency; each now has a market value of about $1 billion. Beyond mutual funds, such investments also are held in the portfolios of hedge funds and public pension plans, which are harder to track. The White House declined to comment on Obama's holdings in the Illinois General Assembly's pension plan, which he earned while serving in that state's senate. The president has disclosed between $50,000 and $100,000 in the plan. Other indirect investors in firearms companies include advocates for gun regulation in the U.S. Congress and several parents of children who attended Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut — site of the 2012 massacre of 20 students and six staff members. Fund managers are drawn to the stocks by surging sales. Buyers are arming themselves, analysts said, in response to mass shootings and calls for tougher gun laws. By the end of 2015, more than 150 mutual funds owned Smith & Wesson shares, up from 53 at the end of 2008, and nearly 130 held stock in Ruger, up from 52, according to data from Morningstar Inc. It would have taken investors ""minimal due diligence"" to see massive profit potential in Ruger stock when Obama was first elected, said Ruger Chief Executive Mike Fifer. Shares hit a low of $4.50 the Friday after that Tuesday election; the stock was changing hands today at $61.61. ""Orders at every level of the distribution channel exploded"" the week of Obama's election, Fifer recalled. ""And continued to do so for months afterward."" AMMO RUSH America's leading ammunition maker, Vista Outdoor Inc., has drawn investments from 319 funds in its first year of public trading and now has a market value of $2.9 billion. Its bonds are owned by a who's-who of U.S. investment and insurance companies. (For a graphic of top mutual fund investors in the leading gun and ammo stocks, Click Here Now ) Such investments can be hard to identify within large funds, even with concerted effort. Eric Milgram, a corporate research analyst whose two children were at Sandy Hook Elementary during the rampage, tried to purge his portfolio of firearms holdings. But he gave up after a frustrating search through mutual fund stock lists, holding companies and subsidiaries. ""I'm disgusted with this industry; I don't want to be invested in it,"" said Milgram. But, he added: ""There are only so many hours in the day."" Vanguard Group, the nation's largest fund company, said it was unrealistic to balance political sensibilities with obligations to meet performance benchmarks. ""It would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to fulfill these obligations while managing portfolios that reflect the social concerns of all our clients,"" said Vanguard  spokeswoman Arianna Stefanoni Sherlock. Vanguard does, however, offer a Social Index fund — with about $2 billion in assets out of Vanguard's total of about $3.4 trillion — that excludes firearms companies along with other stocks involved in an array of ethically sensitive industries. Smith & Wesson declined to comment for this story. Vista Outdoor did not respond to requests for comment. SMALL STAKES, BIG IMPACT Obama and his tiny stake are typical of most Americans with holdings in firearms investments: They are invested in funds that buy shares of the relatively small part of the firearms industry that is publicly traded. But collectively, their investments are a boon to the gun industry and amount to a sizable stake in major gun and ammo makers. For some gun safety advocates, the amounts are less important than the principle. Po Murray, who put four children through Sandy Hook Elementary, has also struggled to determine whether her investments include firearms companies. ""It's a real surprise: You find out you could be invested indirectly in Smith & Wesson,"" said Murray, who chairs the Newtown Action Alliance, a gun safety group. ""I don't want to be invested in gun companies."" The $16 billion Illinois pension fund that includes Obama's investment holds at least $4.8 million in shares of gun industry stocks, including Smith & Wesson, Ruger, Vista and ammunition maker Olin Corp. Until 2014, the pension fund owned about $1.5 million of the debt of Remington Outdoors, another gun manufacturer. Remington did not respond to requests for comment. The Illinois pension plan also invests in at least one mutual fund with gun industry exposure. The $1.1 billion Templeton Global Smaller Companies Fund owned $9.5 million of Smith & Wesson stock at the end of December, fund disclosures show. Obama and other plan participants have no say in how the money is invested. That's controlled by the Illinois State Board of Investment, which said it has no policy on investing in firearm and ammo companies. (For a graphic showing firearms investments by Obama's Illinois pension fund, Click Here Now.) In its analysis, Reuters used mutual fund holdings data from Morningstar and Lipper Inc., a Thomson Reuters company, to examine firearms investments during the Obama presidency. The list of funds holding such stocks includes some of the biggest and most prominent, such as Vanguard and the second-largest fund group, Fidelity Investments. It extends to BlackRock Inc., and Dimensional Fund Advisors. The analysis is based on disclosures made by individual funds. Some of the gun stockholders are passively managed index funds. But many are actively managed, such as Fidelity's $40 billion Low-Priced Stock Fund, which has become Smith & Wesson's second-largest mutual fund investor under storied stock-picker Joel Tillinghast. The fund held about 1.1 million shares worth $20 million as of Oct. 31, according to fund disclosures. Fidelity and Dimensional declined to comment. BlackRock — the world's largest asset manager with $4.6 trillion under management — manages $200 billion of that total in investment options that screen out certain stocks, including companies involved in  firearms, tobacco and alcohol businesses, spokesman Peter McKillop said. GUN INVESTMENTS IN CONGRESS Obama isn't the only gun-regulation advocate with gun-industry holdings. Former congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy — elected after her husband was killed in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting — pushed relentlessly for gun safety legislation. 

While in office, she held shares worth between $3,003 and $45,000 in at least three exchange-traded funds with stakes in gun and ammo companies, according to her last financial disclosure before retiring last year. She also invested between $2,002 and $30,000 for two grandchildren in so-called 529 college-savings plans that include a Vanguard fund holding firearms stocks, disclosures show. The New York Democrat could not be reached for comment. As a federal retirement benefit, members of the U.S. Congress can participate in a Thrift Savings Plan, which offers an investment option — the S Fund — that holds stock in firearms companies. Financial disclosures show that S Fund investors include Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat and a leading advocate for stricter background checks for gun buyers. Durbin disclosed an S Fund investment of about $115,000. Durbin's office declined to comment. Some members of Congress welcome the investment option. ""I'm just grateful the fund managers are investing in something that's making money,"" said Representative Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican who opposes gun restrictions and has a small investment in the S fund. 'GOOD FOR BUSINESS' For all the debate, Obama has made no progress in passing tougher gun laws. Measures such as universal background checks have withered in Congress, where the number of anti-gun control Republicans has grown. Calls for tighter controls have been met with bursts of gun sales, according to U.S. background-check data on gun purchasers. Gun store owners attribute the extra sales to consumers who fear the president will make it harder to buy arms. ""Let's just say he's been good for business,"" Jack Lesher, manager of Chuck's Firearms in Atlanta, said of Obama. Gun sales jumped again recently after the president blasted congressional inaction on gun control and vowed to use executive powers to expand background checks for buyers and bolster licensing requirements for dealers. His announcement followed yet another mass shooting, on Dec. 2 in San Bernardino, California, where a couple pledging allegiance to Islamic State killed 14 people. For the week that ended Dec. 20, firearms background checks — a proxy for guns sales — totaled 839,109, the second-highest week since 1998. Only the week after the Sandy Hook shootings was higher, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Vista's main factories have churned out bullets 24 hours, seven days a week for at least two years, Vista Chief Financial Officer Stephen Nolan told investors in November. Now the industry is ready for an election-year surge. ""The politics of gun control could stay in the headlines, which we believe could lead to a record year,"" wrote Chris Krueger, senior research analyst at Lake Street Capital Markets, in a note to investors in January. Ruger is boosting inventories to prepare, after learning a costly lesson going into the last presidential election. Demand peaked that year, based on the number of FBI background checks sought for new gun purchases. The surge followed Obama's re-election and the Sandy Hook shooting. ""When we went into late 2011, we got cleaned out of inventory  even though we increased production dramatically,"" company CEO Fifer told investors during a November conference call. The company, he said, ""probably left money on the table."" © 2021 Thomson/Reuters.  All rights reserved. Newsmax, Moneynews, Newsmax Health, and Independent.

301,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/bernie-sanders-awkward-history-with-guns-in-america-119185#ixzz3z8zwA21i,"2016 The renewed debate about gun violence could resurface Sanders’ erratic record on gun control. By JONATHAN TOPAZ 06/18/2015 07:30 PM EDT Bernie Sanders is a liberal standard-bearer on nearly every single policy issue, from climate change to taxation to financial regulation. But there’s one notable exception – guns. With President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton calling for a gut check on gun violence in America after the mass shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., the Vermont senator’s awkward history with the issue of gun control now seems poised to resurface. Arguably, the independent senator from Vermont has taken a pragmatic approach – his state prides itself on a deep hunting and gun culture and has traditionally fiercely defended its lax guns laws. But while his campaign manager says he is “very moderate” on the issue, others call him “erratic.” To wit, he has voted against the Brady Bill, voted for an assault weapons ban, voted to allow firearms on Amtrak, and voted for universal background checks — upsetting gun-control and gun-rights advocates alike. Also on POLITICO SARAH WHEATON It’s not clear if his approach on the subject will hurt Sanders, who is enjoying a surge in the polls and overflow crowds on the campaign trail. Still, as the gun-control conversation ratchets back up in the wake of the Wednesday’s shooting, Sanders risks looking like he’s out-of-touch with his progressive base and a bit tone deaf. Sanders didn’t ignore the tragedy in Charleston, though there was an uncomfortable moment when his rally outside the Capitol for bolstering union retiree benefits overlapped briefly with a prayer vigil nearby for the victims of the shooting at the historically black church. He canceled a campaign event for this Sunday in South Carolina and urged supporters in an email to make a contribution to the Emanuel AME Church with a link to the church’s website. He also issued a statement saying, “The Charleston church killings are a tragic reminder of the ugly stain of racism that still taints our nation.” The statement did not mention guns, and when asked for further comment, Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver offered a less-than-forceful call for addressing the issue of gun violence: “This sick and tragic attack is an example of why we need to ensure that guns do not end up in the hands of dangerous people. We also ask ourselves how we rid our country of the repugnant racist views which apparently fueled this killer’s depraved act against our fellow Americans while they were in the sanctuary of a house of God.” Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, delivered a more direct call to action during a speech in Las Vegas. “We have to face hard truths about race, violence, guns and divisions,” she said. She asked, “How many people do we need to see cut down before we act?” Sanders’ history with gun control issues dates back to the very beginning of his Washington career. Sanders, the legend goes, came to Congress because of the National Rifle Association. It’s not quite as simple as that — Vermonters remember Republican Peter Smith, who lost in the 1990 rematch after beating Sanders in 1988, as an awkward candidate poorly-suited for politics. Also on POLITICO NICK GASS But after Smith came out in support of an assault-weapons ban after opposing it in his successful 1988 campaign against Sanders, the NRA invested heavily in defeating him — an opposition campaign that likened Smith to Pinocchio for his flip-flop and featured bumper stickers: “Smith and Wesson — Yes, Smith in Congress — No.” The NRA didn’t campaign for Sanders in 1990, and Jeff Weaver, the campaign manager for his presidential bid and a longtime adviser, noted that Sanders supported an assault weapons ban and never embraced a pro-gun message. “The easy position would have been to be against the assault weapons ban,” said Weaver, pushing back on the idea that Sanders catered to the NRA for political purposes. (Weaver made the comments before the Charleston shooting.) Still, people recall that Sanders, then the four-term mayor of Burlington, was cautious not to step in. “Bernie let the NRA do his dirty work on that one to sink Smith. He played it very close to the vest,” said Garrison Nelson, a professor at University of Vermont who has known Sanders for around four decades. Instead, Sanders said that he didn’t support the proposed Brady Bill, which instituted federal background checks and a five-day waiting period, and vowed that he wouldn’t flip-flop on the issue. He won the election by nearly 20 points. Sanders’ improbable political journey — from quixotic left-wing politician scoring in the low single-digits in statewide elections to the longest-serving independent in congressional history — is one marked by this political acumen. “The thing about Bernie which is different from most socialists, is Bernie wants to win,” Nelson said. While in Congress, Sanders continued to oppose the Brady Bill because of the waiting period, which he said should be determined at the state level. He voted against the bill but in favor of an amendment from then-West Virginia Democratic Rep. Harley Staggers for an instant background check for all handgun purchases. Also on POLITICO NICK GASS and DANIEL STRAUSS Still, his opposition to the landmark legislation prompted backlash, including a 1991 headline from the Vermont Times: “Who’s Afraid of the NRA? Vermont’s Congressmen, That’s Who,” featuring a photo of Sanders. In the article, a Sanders adviser argued that a majority of Vermonters opposed the Brady Bill. That appeal to his constituents, some said, is an example of Sanders’ outreach to rural voters, particularly those in areas such as the conservative Northeast Kingdom, which has given him support throughout his career. “Bernie basically has been able to appeal to groups that no one assumed would support socialists,” said Nelson — including gun-rights supporters, police during his time in Burlington and veterans’ groups as a senator. (Sanders, as chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, helped craft and pass a bipartisan, multi-billion dollar legislation to reform the Veterans Affairs Department.) Sanders’ vote against the Brady Bill was one of several that appealed to the gun-rights community, including a 2007 vote that prohibited foreign or United Nations aid to be used for gun control and a 2009 vote to allow firearms on checked bags on Amtrak. The most distressing vote for gun-control advocates is his 2005 vote in favor of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, an NRA-backed bill to disallow gun manufacturers from being sued for negligence when people commit crimes with their guns. A recent Slate article focusing on the vote called Sanders a “gun nut,” and activists say the bill provides a level of legal protection for the gun manufacturers unprecedented for any other industry. “Any smart person had to realize how insidious that law was,” said Brady Campaign president Dan Gross, who said the vote was a big reason for why he described Sanders’ gun-control record as “erratic.” Weaver defended the vote, saying that while Sanders wants to ban assault weapons, gun manufacturers shouldn’t be sued if their product works effectively. “I believe he would make the same vote” today, said Weaver. Also on POLITICO NICK GASS And even when voting for significant gun control measures, Sanders has tempered his support. In 2013, he voted for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban — the recent landmark gun legislation in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting – and expressed reservations about the impact. “If you passed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don’t think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen,” he told Seven Days Vermont a month before the vote, adding that he was still on the fence about the assault weapons ban. In his official statement following his vote for the legislation in April 2013, Sanders opened with a caveat: “Nobody believes that gun control by itself is going to end the horrors we have seen in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., Tucson, Ariz. and other American communities.” And on liberal comedian Bill Maher’s television show last year, Sanders said mental health was “maybe the more important issue” than gun control. “We’ve got millions of folks walking the streets who are need of mental health and they can’t walk into a place and get it,” he said. “This is the NRA talking point. I’m not saying it’s wrong, but I’m just saying, that’s what they say,” Maher responded. He has also often expressed that different states have different gun cultures and many decisions on the issue should be made not at the federal level, but the state and local levels. Asked about those statements, Gross said: “Clearly a guy running for president … He does not do the truth any favors when he seeks to walk those fine lines,” adding that Sanders is trying to have it “both ways.” Weaver dismissed the idea that Sanders had a poll-tested message on guns, calling that a “fantasy” and saying his moderate approach is an “organic position.” The NRA has largely turned on Sanders — his most recent grade from the group is a D- and he has received an F before. And Ed Cutler, president of Gun Owners of Vermont, said gun-rights group in the state just don’t trust him. “We, in Vermont, consider him anti-gun,” he said. Missing out on the latest scoops?

          / CBS News Following the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, the threat of homegrown terrorism and plans to defeat ISIS have taken center stage at the presidential race. Some candidates have promised aggressive measures, such as Sen. Ted Cruz who vowed to ""carpet-bomb ISIS,"" and Donald Trump, who proposed temporarily banning all Muslims from entering the country. But while the rhetoric may resonate with voters because ""they seem to provide answers,"" neither are viable solutions, according to CNN's national security analyst Peter Bergen. ""Ted Cruz wants to drop the bomb on ISIS but ISIS is embedded in the civilian population. Banning all Muslims - most of the people carrying out these attacks are American residents, American citizens, so that doesn't really solve the problem either,"" Bergen told ""CBS This Morning"" Tuesday. So far, there have been more than 300 arrests of people involved in some kind of jihadist crime, of which an alarming number - four out of five - were American citizens and residents. In his new book, ""United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists,"" Bergen offers a comprehensive look at ""homegrown"" Islamist terrorism, including a portrait of American jihadists based on 330 militants studied since 9/11. At an average age of 29, one-third are married and have kids, 12 percent have served time in prison and 10 percent have mental health issues. ""They're as educated as the average American, similar incomes - these are ordinary Americans. American Muslims are well integrated into American society in a way that's not true in places like Paris or London,"" Bergen said. Bergen said he also tried to answer the ""puzzle"" to determine the root of radicalization and point in which an individual decides to carry out a terrorist attack - but said he found ""no common denominators."" ""Some people have personal disappointments, or object to American foreign policy. Some people are Islamic, very radicalized - each person is a little different..."" Bergen said, then added that it could also be a ""cocktail"" of several factors. According to Bergen, resolving this ""puzzle"" is also a challenge for the FBI in their efforts to counter terror plots and detect homegrown terrorists, but he assured their defenses are ""very good."" Before the 9/11 attacks, just 16 people suspected of ties to terrorism were deemed on the no-fly list. That number has now jumped to 47,000. In 2015, there were also 900 active investigations across all 50 states and 56 were arrested. Still, according to a recent CBS News/New York Times Poll, 63 percent of Americans are very concerned about terror attacks committed by people currently in the United States, and 59 percent are concerned about terrorists entering the country. ""You're 5,000 times more likely to be killed by a fellow American with a gun than you are to be killed by a jihadi terrorist in this country. Yet we're more afraid about terrorism than we should be,"" Bergen said. ""The government of both the Bush and Obama administration has done a very good job of containing this threat. It will be persistent, it's not going to go away, but it is managed and contained."" But some plots slip through the cracks, like the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino by American citizen Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, a Pakistani immigrant. Bergen explained that while authorities ""should've known more"" about warning signs, the fact that the attackers were a married couple - which eliminated the need for separate meetings to plot the attack - and appeared to be ""regular, outstanding members of society"" with kids and a good job - made it difficult to foil. Bergen also commented on the controversy surrounding President Obama's refusal to link ISIS with Islam. President Obama has taken heat from critics for taking pains to separate Islam from terrorism. Former President George W. Bush walked the same line following the 9/11 attacks. Drawing comparisons to the Christian crusades, Bergen said, ""It's an uncomfortable fact that this has something to do with Islam. I mean you can't just wish that away... Of course it's a cherry-picked version of Islam but it is something to do with Islam."" First published on February 2, 2016 / 1:42 PM © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

305,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/GmGeYufvNNs/,"Twenty-one-year-old Khalil Abu-Rayyan of Dearborn Heights, Michigan planned to attack a Detroit church with 6,000 members on behalf of the Islamic State, according to a federal criminal complaint. Abu-Rayyan is not currently facing terrorism charges, but was instead appearing in federal court Thursday on gun and marijuana charges, having been found with pot and a pistol when he was pulled over for speeding by Detroit police on October 7. The FBI revealed it has been investigating him since May of 2015 “regarding increasingly violent threats he has made to others about committing acts of terror and martydom – including brutal acts against police officers, churchgoers and others – on behalf of the foreign terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraqi and Levant.” The Detroit Free Press reports that federal agents have been monitoring Abu-Rayyan’s phone conversations and social media, including two Twitter accounts where he expressed support for ISIS and posted its propaganda, including “videos of a Jordanian pilot burned alive, Christians being beheaded, and men being thrown from buildings in executions.” In a series of online conversations with an undercover FBI operative, Abu-Rayyan “repeatedly expressed his desire to commit a martyrdom operation.” He had a few specific ideas for how he might “martyr” himself for the glory of ISIS. He talked about wanting to kill the officer who arrested him for speeding by shooting up the hospital where the policeman was recuperating from a heart attack. He also talked about planning a gun massacre at a 6,000-member church, one of the “biggest ones in Detroit.” He said he had purchased sufficient ammunition and was ready to strike, but his jihad plan was scuttled when his father searched his car and found his gun, bullets, and the mask he planned to use. He was also worried about having to constantly reload his six-shot pistol during a mass shooting spree. (However, the Detroit News reports that in other social media postings, Abu-Rayyan claimed to own an AK-47 with a 40-round magazine, similar to the type of weapon favored by ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria.) The FBI complaint noted that a church fitting the description of Abu-Rayyan’s intended target is located only half a mile from where he works. He told the FBI why he thought the church would make a good target: “It’s easy and a lot of people go there. Plus people are not allowed to carry guns in church. Plus, it would make the news. Everyone would’ve heard.” “Honestly, I regret not doing it,” Abu-Rayyan added. “If I can’t do jihad in the Middle East, I would do my jihad over here.” Other details from the federal complaint include Abu-Rayyan’s “dream to behead someone,” for which purpose he wanted to keep swords and large knives handy; his tendency to become “excited” when he heard about killings; a Twitter profile photo that shows him standing in his driveway and flashing the ISIS one-finger victory salute; and a photo of himself posing with a rifle captioned “Sahwat hunting,” which means he was fantasizing about shooting Iraqi tribesmen who oppose the Islamic State. Abu-Rayyan has a detention hearing scheduled for Monday afternoon, and has been assigned a federal defender, according to The Detroit News.

Tuesday, 02 February 2016 06:33 AM Study your surroundings. Find exits. Identify makeshift weapons. Americans are gleaning those tips and others as they pack classes on how to react to and survive a shooting. Such training is already common at schools, colleges and businesses, but sessions for the general public are the next step in confronting fears of mass violence that have been around for years and, for many, came to a head after the 1999 Columbine High School shootings. Police have offered the ""awareness training"" in Livonia, Michigan, and Douglasville, Georgia, while more than 600 people have attended classes taught by the Potter County Sheriff's Office in Amarillo, Texas, beginning about three years ago. Public demand increased dramatically after the mass shooting in December that killed 14 in San Bernardino, California, said Lt. Scott Giles, a class instructor in Amarillo. ""This is really just something that was born out of necessity,"" Giles said. ""Active shooter events just continue to happen."" Potter County is one of several sheriff's departments that provide training based on the CRASE curriculum: Civilian Response to Active Shooter Events. CRASE teaches an approach dubbed ADD: ""Avoid"" the situation by getting out, ""Deny"" by barricading inside a room, and as a last resort, ""Defend"" by fighting back. A class offered by Westerville, a Columbus suburb, filled up so quickly that a second had to be scheduled for later this month. The city of about 38,000, with a per capita income well above the rest of Ohio, regularly tops lists of the country's best suburbs. ""We just feel the world has changed. There's evil out there,"" said retiree Tom Madine, 67, who attended the first Westerville class last month with his wife, Sue Madine, along with dozens of others. People today understand that such threats are real and could happen in their own communities, said Police Chief Joe Morbitzer. Officers teach a ""Run, Hide, Fight"" curriculum similar to ADD. ""Part of the issue is that people don't know how to avoid becoming victims,"" Morbitzer said. ""In today's society that's bad, that you've got to practice victim avoidance, but you have to."" At the Jan. 28 Westerville class, officers Dan Pignatelli and John Jeffries emphasized ""situational awareness."" They mixed practical tips — for instance, the best exit in an emergency is not always the way you came in, and if you're hiding, always turn the lights off — with case studies from the 1999 Columbine shooting, the 2007 Virginia Tech killings and others. As a last resort, a weapon could be as near as the closest chair, pair of scissors or blunt object, they said. ""You've got to have a game plan,"" Jeffries, a 31-year police veteran, told the audience. His comment was part of a bigger point both instructors drove home throughout the two-hour class: that people must overcome inaction when something bad happens. Instructors in Ohio and elsewhere don't take a position on whether people legally allowed to carry a gun should intervene to stop an attacker. But they worry about what happens once police arrive. ""When a civilian, let alone a trained officer, opens up firing in an active shooter situation, there is a good chance that civilian may be mistaken for the shooter,"" said Philip Schaenman, a security expert who has studied some of the country's worst shootings, including Virginia Tech. Denise Bunsey attended the January class in Westerville with her parents. Afterward, the 36-year-old guidance counselor said the most important lesson was that people have options even in worst-case scenarios. ""Despite what's going on, you really have to have the mindset of, 'I will survive this and I will do anything I can to survive this,'"" Bunsey said. ""I never thought about it in that way."" © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

308,http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/conservatives-gun-control-and-distrust/408643/,"Liberals tend to blame the gun lobby for blocking new regulations, but they dismiss firearm owners’ fear of government at their own political peril. Here we are again: Another massacre, another discussion about gun control—not about instituting new gun controls, mind you, but about why such new regulations are almost certainly dead on arrival. An angry but resigned President Obama lashed out Thursday night. “We’ve become numb to this,” he said. “We talked about this after Columbine, Blacksburg, Tucson, Newtown, Aurora, after Charleston …. This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America.” While Obama has repeatedly called for new gun controls, those attempts have hit a wall in Congress. Furthermore, of the gun laws enacted at the state level since the Newtown massacre, more have actually loosened restrictions than tightened them. Firearm production and sales have also increased since Obama took office. The common liberal explanation for why this has happened is the entrenched power of the gun lobby—the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers. This isn’t wrong. The NRA’s power is considerable and it is carefully and effectively wielded. But focusing exclusively on the lobbying angle overlooks the very real fear and distrust with which many gun owners regard the government that drives much of the opposition to gun laws. Many of them simply don’t believe that enhanced background checks—or whatever other modest changes are proposed—are what they appear to be. Take it from Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia who was a prime driving force behind the failed early 2013 attempt to pass strong background checks. “They’re scared this is the first step,” Manchin said at New York Ideas that year. “When you say universal background check, the first thing that comes in the mind of a gun owner is that means registration, and registration means confiscation. ‘I haven’t broken the laws, why do you want to know everything?’” This distrust helps to explain one of the central paradoxes of the gun-control debate. How can it be that vast majorities of Americans, including gun owners, favor stricter background checks, and yet there’s not the political will to pass them? One reason is that theoretical support for checks is different than trust the Obama administration to institute them. Every time the president changes a stance or exercises presidential power—for example, issuing an executive order to allow DREAMers and their families to stay after saying he couldn’t—it adds fuel to the worry: Look, he said he couldn’t and wouldn’t do this with executive authority. Why should we believe he won’t do the same with guns? One thing Obama said Thursday particularly triggered this fear. “We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings,” he said. “Friends of ours, allies of ours—Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it.” After a 1996 massacre in Port Arthur, Australia significantly tightened its laws. The legislation “outlawed automatic and semi-automatic rifles, as well as pump-action shotguns. A nationwide gun buyback scheme also saw more than 640,000 weapons turned in to authorities,” NBC explains. (If you have progressive friends on Facebook, you’ve almost certainly seen the viral video of Aussie comedian Jim Jeffries talking about gun control down under.) The mention of Australia is coded language to conservatives, as the writer Charles C.W. Cooke noted: ""But why do you think Obama wants confiscation?"" ""Because he keeps praising it on national television."" Politically, this may seem absurd. Obama may personally think confiscating guns is a great idea, but there’s no prospect that he could get such a policy enacted into law—and if he did, the Supreme Court’s recent precedents on the Second Amendment make it unlikely the law would stand. No one needs to guess what policy Obama might actually back in Congress, because he already tried: It was modest. And it failed. Psychologically, however, supporters of gun control ignore this attitude at their own political risk. In fact, the professional advocates have already taken it into account—as Molly Ball reported in 2013, they’ve adopted language intended to be more value-  (and fear-) neutral: “gun violence,” “reducing gun violence,” “gun-violence legislation.” (Not that it’s helped them much.) Do gun lobbyists work to encourage and exploit this fear? Of course they do. Here’s a series of recent emails on the mailing list of the National Association of Gun Rights, which split from the NRA because it considered the older organization too soft: But even if these worries about confiscation seem politically misplaced, and even they are encouraged by political advocates (psychological persuasion is, after all, what political advocates on all sides do), that doesn’t mean they are fake or easily dismissed. Any attempt to reform gun laws will have to grapple with this fear of government.",2016-02-21 05:58:00,Why Conservatives Mistrust Even the Most Modest Efforts at Gun Control,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,lobbying and lobbyists,gun control,firearms",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

Dalton with six counts of open murder Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting announced the charges just before 1:30 p.m. Monday. Dalton, 45, also is charged with two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight counts of felony firearm use, Getting said. District Judge Anne E. Blatchford issued a warrant for Dalton's arrest at 1:45 p.m. today. ""The Kalamazoo community is reeling from these senseless acts of violence that took so many innocent lives from us,"" Getting said. ""And our hearts are saddened for all of the victims, their families and friends who are dealing with this on a much more personal level. We are reaching out to these victims and offering all the resources of the Prosecutor's Office to help them at this very difficult time."" Dalton is expected to be arraigned this afternoon via video by District Judge Christopher T. Haenicke. He faces a sentence of mandatory life without parole if convicted of open murder, felony murder or first-degree murder. Police and prosecutors allege Dalton's shooting spree began shortly after 5:40 p.m. Saturday in Richland Township when he shot Tiana Carruthers multiple times in the parking lot of Meadow Townhomes, off East G Avenue in Richland Township. Just after 10 p.m., Dalton is accused of fatally shooting Tyler Smith, 17, and Tyler's father, as they were looking at cars at Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive. Minutes later, police said Dalton opened fire again, killing four women and critically injuring a 14-year-old girl as they sat in two different vehicles in the parking lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant on South Ninth Street in Texas Township. Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda; Mary Jo Nye, 60, Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, and Barbara Hawthorne, 68, all of Battle Creek, were killed in the shooting at Cracker Barrel. The 14-year-old, whose name has not been released, was in critical condition at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo after the shooting.

Dalton is suspected of using in a mass shooting spree, authorities said Sunday. The weapon, a semiautomatic handgun, was recovered from Dalton's Chevrolet HHR after a Kalamazoo County sheriff's deputy spotted him in the parking lot of a downtown bar and took Dalton into custody. In the hours before his arrest, Dalton is suspected of opening fire at three different locations in Kalamazoo County, killing six people and seriously injuring two others. Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said ATF agents are helping investigators from his agency, Michigan State Police and the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office pinpoint the origin and the history of the alleged murder weapon. Hadley said investigators also are working to determine if Dalton had any other guns in his possession at the time of the shooting rampage. Crime lab technicians and sheriff's deputies searched for evidence Sunday morning at Dalton's house at 7031 Douglas Avenue in Cooper Township. County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said Dalton fired approximately 30 or more rounds Saturday between the three shooting scenes. He said the shell casings found at each scene matched the caliber of the handgun police recovered from Dalton's car. Getting declined to say Sunday what caliber of gun was found in Dalton's car. ""The evidence at each of the scenes is consistent with each other and it's consistent with the evidence recovered but that doesn't necessarily mean it's all the same gun and MSP will be checking comparisons,"" Getting said. Police suspect Dalton's alleged shooting spree began at about 6 p.m. Saturday when he shot a woman multiple times in Richland Township. The woman, who police have not identified, is expected to survive. Four hours later, police said Dalton shot and 17-year-old and his father in the parking lot of Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive and then, at 10:15 p.m., shot four women and a 14-year-old girl in the parking  lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant on South Ninth Street at I-94. The two men shot at Seelye Automotive and the four women shot at the Cracker Barrel restaurant were killed. The 14-year-old girl was clinging to life Sunday at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo. Police have said it appears Dalton picked his victims at random during the shooting spree and that the shootings were unprovoked. Rex Hall Jr. is a reporter at MLive.com.

An analysis conducted by the Los Angeles Country Commission on Human Relations discovered that hate crimes increased to nearly a dozen in the last two months of 2015, compared with one such crime during the comparable period in 2014. ""We expected there to be an uptick,"" said Robin Toma, the executive director of the commission, KNBC reported. ""We always hope and wish that we progress as a society [and] that people are less prone to acting out without thinking, and not generalizing an entire group or religion based on the acts of a few, but we know that not everyone is there yet."" During November and December in L.A. County, a middle school was spray-painted with anti-Islamic rhetoric, an Islamic school received a threat that everyone would be shot, a man who said he was from Saudi Arabia was physically assaulted, a man found his motorcycle defaced with anti-Arab language, and a mosque was vandalized.  The uptick in hate crimes targeting Muslims and Middle Easterners comes in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris and a mass shooting San Bernardino, California. In December, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors passed a motion to condemn the San Bernardino attack to recognize that ""no religion or race or ethnicity is responsible for these acts"" and that ""fear-based stereotyping and scapegoating creates an atmosphere conducive to Islamophobia, xenophobia, discrimination, hate and bigotry."" Furthermore, in January the Los Angeles Countywide Criminal Justice Coordination Committee created a task force aimed at promoting stronger relations and cooperation among police agencies and affected communities, as well as to prepare for any future incident that could result in an increase of hate crimes. Anti-Muslim rhetoric has been used this election season by several candidates, including Republican front-runner Donald Trump. At a rally in Virginia Monday, the billionaire businessman reportedly told a fictional story about an army general killing Muslim terrorists with bullets dipped in pigs’ blood. This rhetoric has played well with his fans but drawn condemnation from members of both parties.",2016-03-01 08:41:40,Los Angeles Anti-Muslim Hate Crimes Rise: County Sees Significant Spike,"religion and churches,islam,crime and criminals",41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

And that is also likely to be when the question ""Why?"" is answered, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Rick Fuller. But the answer is unlikely to be a satisfying, he said. ""He can come out and say, 'It was this or it was that,'"" Fuller said of why eight people were shot last Saturday night in Kalamazoo, ""but nobody's going to accept it and why should they believe him?"" ""What motive would be good enough?"" Fuller asked, referring to assaulting  completed strangers without provocation. ""And are we going to believe what he says? And then say, 'Oh, now I get it.'"" Jason Brian Dalton, 45, of Cooper Township, was arrested at about 12:40 a.m. Sunday in Kalamazoo in connection with a series of shootings in the area that have left six people dead and two badly injured. The married father of two is being held in the Kalamazoo County Jail on multiple charges of murder, attempted murder and felony firearms possession. Dalton was an insurance adjuster who also worked as a driver for Uber, the online taxi service. Police and witnesses say he transported Uber customers in his vehicle -- without harming them -- between stops at three locations where he inexplicably shot others with whom he had no apparent connection. According to news reports, Dalton was acting reserved and unusual earlier Saturday before the shooting began. Paul Vlachos, attorney for Dalton's wife Carol, told ABC News that Jason Dalton had been acting differently and seemed to be depressed and down. A neighbor said he argued vehemently with the teenage friend of her daughter for driving too fast through a driveway adjacent to his house. And there are other reports that he may have fired a gun behind his Douglas Avenue residence on Friday and Saturday. But Fuller suggested that people try to focus on ""the who, not the why."" ""Let's focus on those who were injured and help them,"" he said. ""The 'why' is a question that's human nature but motive will come out in court."" Abigail Kopf, 14, of Battle Creek, remained in critical condition Thursday night at Bronson Methodist Hospital. Her parents said she has been showing small signs of progress. Tiana Carruthers, the first person attacked when the shooting spree began at about 5:40 p.m. Saturday, remained in serious condition Thursday evening. The last shootings occurred at about 10:40 p.m. ""She's doing better,"" Fuller said of Carruthers, whose family has enlisted him to act as a spokesman. He said she is listed in serious condition. Carruthers has been reported to be 25 but that has not been confirmed. Killed during the shooting spree were: Mary Jo Nye, 60, of Battle Creek; her sister-in-law Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda; Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, of Battle Creek; Barbara Hawthorne, 68, of Battle Creek; Richard Eugene Smith Jr., 53, of Kalamazoo; and his son Tyler Daniel Smith, 17, also of Kalamazoo. Fuller said the investigation into the shootings has become an impressive team effort involved his department, the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety and the Michigan State Police. ""It's a team effort with no real lead agency,"" he said. The investigation work generally fell in line with the officers who responded at the three locations where the shootings occurred, he said. Detectives with the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office are primarily handling the shooting that occurred at The Meadows townhomes in Richland Township. Kalamazoo Public Safety detectives are handling the incident at the Seelye Automotive Group's Kia dealership in Stadium Drive in Kalamazoo. And detectives with the Michigan State Police are handling shootings that took place outside the Cracker Barrel restaurant off 9th Street in Texas Township. ""Those agencies took the initial investigation at each of those scenes and all of the detectives are working en masse,"" Fuller said. ""They are all working as one.""

316,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/technology/apple-wins-ruling-in-new-york-iphone-hacking-order.html?_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by By Katie Benner and Joseph Goldstein A federal magistrate judge on Monday denied the United States government’s request that Apple extract data from an iPhone in a drug case in New York, giving the company’s pro-privacy stance a boost as it battles law enforcement officials over opening up the device in other cases. The ruling, from Judge James Orenstein in New York’s Eastern District, is the first time that the government’s legal argument for opening up devices like the iPhone has been put to the test. The denial could influence other cases where law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help unlock iPhones, including the standoff between Apple and the F.B.I. over the iPhone used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year. Judge Orenstein, in his 50-page ruling on Monday, took particular aim at a 1789 statute called the All Writs Act that underlies many government requests for extracting data from tech companies. The All Writs Act broadly says that courts can require actions to comply with their orders when not covered by existing law. Judge Orenstein said the government was inflating its authority by using the All Writs Act to force Apple to extract data from an iPhone seized in connection with a drug case. The government’s view of the All Writs Act is so expansive as to cast doubt on its constitutionality if adopted, Judge Orenstein wrote. The All Writs Act is also being invoked in the fight over an iPhone in the San Bernardino shooting, which has publicly pitted Apple against the government. Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has refused to comply with a federal court order to help break into the phone, saying that he needs to protect the data of all customers. That has set off a far-reaching debate over privacy and security. Both the F.B.I. and Apple have called for Congress to step in to help settle the question of when law enforcement should get access to citizens’ private data. On Tuesday, Apple’s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, and James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, will testify about balancing privacy and safety before the House Judiciary Committee. “It’s important that a judge for the first time recognizes the All Writs Act doesn’t provide the lawful authority the government has been claiming in these cases,” said Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., which supports Apple’s position. “It demonstrates that when the government’s arguments are put to the test, a federal court has decided they were not actually right.” In a statement on Monday in response to Judge Orenstein’s ruling, the Justice Department said it would ask the judge to review the decision. Apple had previously agreed to help open up the iPhone in the drug case, and has complied with past All Writs Act orders, the Justice Department said. “This phone may contain evidence that will assist us in an active criminal investigation, and we will continue to use the judicial system in our attempt to obtain it,” the Justice Department said. A federal judge has denied the United States government’s request to open up an Apple iPhone in a drug case in New York. An Apple senior executive said Monday’s ruling makes clear that helping to open an iPhone is a constitutional issue that should be taken up by Congress. Judge Orenstein’s ruling stands out because the courts have largely been absent on the major questions of electronic surveillance and privacy of our day. While judges around the country have signed at least 70 orders at the request of the government compelling Apple to access data on phones, this was the first time that a judge and Apple have pushed back. The legal back and forth between Judge Orenstein, the Justice Department and Apple began last October, when federal prosecutors applied for a court order to force Apple to unlock an iPhone 5s seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration in a 2014 drug case, according to court documents. After federal prosecutors requested the order, Judge Orenstein argued in an 11-page memo last October that prosecutors were misusing the All Writs Act. The judge asked Apple to weigh in, and the company filed a brief that same month. In addition to agreeing with the judge, the company also said the request could create an undue burden and threatened to “substantially tarnish the Apple brand.” “This reputational harm could have a longer-term economic impact beyond the mere cost of performing the single extraction at issue,” Apple said in a brief. The government then called Apple’s decision to side with the judge a “stunning reversal.” Saritha Komatireddy, a Brooklyn federal prosecutor, said the government’s application in this case “was just a simple routine request for assistance in carrying out a valid search warrant issued by a federal court, as Apple has done so many times before.” During the case, Judge Orenstein said he found it puzzling that Apple had not previously resisted the use of the All Writs Act, including in other cases where Apple had complied with the order. “You have had apparently 70 prior instances where you have not taken the steps available to you,” Judge Orenstein said to Apple’s lawyers during a hearing. Ultimately, Judge Orenstein argued that the government couldn’t use the All Writs Act to ask Apple to help extract information from a device just because a different law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or Calea, addresses the issue and does not include an “information services” company like Apple. Congress has been debating whether to amend Calea to include tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Alphabet’s Google. Still, the decision is not binding for the San Bernardino case, said Eric A. Berg, a litigation lawyer and special counsel with Foley & Lardner, who is a former Justice Department lawyer. “From a technical, legal standpoint, it doesn’t really have much of an effect in the California districts,” Mr. Berg said. But “if you start with public opinion, this is going to be viewed as a victory for the privacy lobby and a defeat for the government in that battle over privacy.” Advertisement",2016-03-01 00:00:00,Apple Wins Ruling in New York iPhone Hacking Order - The New York Times,"law and legislation,tests and testing,computers and the internet,medicine and health,suits and litigation,decisions and verdicts",1,http://nytimes.com
317,http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/supreme-court-gun-rights/419160/,"Five years after its landmark gun-rights decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court is avoiding any cases about the Second Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court declines to hear thousands of cases each year, so in one sense, Monday’s announcement that it wouldn’t take up Friedman v. Highland Park wasn’t much of a surprise. But among the 130 cases the Court declined to grant certiorari on Monday morning, only one elicited a dissent from two justices. Arie Friedman challenged Highland Park’s assault-weapons ban, which prohibits residents from buying, selling, or owning some types of semiautomatic firearms. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Chicago surburb’s ban by narrowly interpreting the Court’s recent Second Amendment rulings, which focused on handguns. That ruling, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his dissent from the denial of certiorari, “eviscerated many of the protections recognized” by the Supreme Court. More importantly, he argued, the Court’s refusal to summarily reverse the Seventh Circuit or even hear the case at all risked “relegating the Second Amendment to a second-class right.” Justice Scalia joined his opinion without comment. Monday’s refusal to hear Friedman is the latest episode in the Supreme Court’s strange silence on the Second Amendment since handing down two landmark rulings, D.C. v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, in 2008 and 2010. As the national debate over the role of firearms in American society intensifies with each mass shooting or proposed gun-control measure, the justices have refused to hear a single major gun-rights case since they applied the Second Amendment to the states five years ago. The Court’s silence hasn’t been for want of a significant case. In June, the justices declined to hear a challenge to San Francisco’s requirement that handguns must be either disabled with trigger locks or stored in locked containers when not in use. The city ordinance was similar, though not identical, to the one struck down by the Supreme Court in D.C. v. Heller in 2008. Last year, the justices ignored two NRA-led cases challenging federal and state age restrictions on firearm purchases. And in 2013, the Court refused a case that sought to overturn New York’s strict regulations on carrying handguns outside the home. The cumulative effect of these denials (and many others) is a bizarre unwillingness to participate in a legal revolution that the Court itself ignited. First, some history. For most of the republic’s existence, the Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, only applied to the federal government. Then, in the 1927 case Gitlow v. New York, the justices ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause extended the protections of the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause to laws passed by state and local governments. The ruling sparked a slow-burning revolution in American constitutional law over the next half-century as the justices steadily began what constitutional scholars refer to as “selective incorporation”: the application of the Bill of Rights to the states, piece by piece. State constitutions already protected many rights in many states, but some of the Court’s incorporation rulings still led to seismic changes, especially in criminal law. In Mapp v. Ohio in 1961, the Court incorporated the exclusionary rule, a Fourth Amendment remedy that prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence during trials, to the states, where most criminal trials in the U.S. take place. Two years later, in Gideon v. Wainwright, the Court also incorporated the Sixth Amendment’s assistance-of-counsel clause and ruled that the states had to provide a lawyer for criminal defendants who could not afford one in felony cases, leading to the creation of the modern public-defender system. By the late 1960s, the Court had expanded most of the Bill of Rights to the states. But the Second Amendment remained an outlier. Only a smattering of cases had addressed it since the Civil War, and those that did often weren’t favorable to the gun-rights movement: U.S. v. Cruikshank, a Reconstruction-era case, explicitly stated that the Second Amendment didn’t apply to the states, and the 1939 case U.S. v. Miller upheld the restrictions of the federal National Firearms Act. As Michael Waldman noted in his recent history of the Second Amendment, virtually all judges and constitutional scholars believed until recently that there was no constitutional right to individual gun ownership. Chief Justice Warren Burger, a staunchly conservative Nixon appointee, called the idea “a fraud on the American public” in a 1980 interview. The most notable gun-related case of the Rehnquist Court, U.S. v. Lopez, struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for exceeding Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce, not for violating the Second Amendment. Then, in two successive rulings in 2008 and 2010, the Supreme Court dramatically reversed course. First, in a 5-4 decision in Heller, the Court ruled that, lo and behold, the Second Amendment did protect an individual’s right to bear arms. Scalia, writing for the majority, relied heavily on English legal history and colonial-era texts to outline the Founders’ intent to protect that right. At the same time, he dismissed those who noted that despite this historical record, the Court itself had never before found such a right. “Other provisions of the Bill of Rights have similarly remained unilluminated for lengthy periods,” he argued. “For most of our history the question did not present itself.” Heller was a triumph of the gun-rights movement, which spent decades dragging the idea out of the hinterlands of American constitutional thought and into the Supreme Court’s rulings. But despite the fears of some and the hopes of others, the decision was more restrained than it could have been. D.C.’s handgun law was among the strictest in the country, making it an easy target for legal activists but limiting its factual relevance for future challenges to other city and state gun laws. In his opinion for the Court, Scalia also indicated that Heller should not throw most of the nation’s gun laws into chaos. Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. For example, the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues. Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. More importantly, the decision only applied to D.C. itself and to the federal government; it would take another ruling to apply it to the states. Two years later, the same 5-4 majority of justices incorporated the Second Amendment to strike down Chicago’s handgun ban in McDonald. Citing the historical record, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that “it is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.” Throughout their opinions in McDonald, both sides braced for future legal challenges to gun laws nationwide. Justice John Paul Stevens complained that the Court “unleashed in Heller a tsunami of legal uncertainty,” citing hundreds of Second Amendment challenges filed in the lower courts in the previous two years. Alito countered those fears with the Court’s past reassurances. We made it clear in Heller that our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as “prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,” “laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.” We repeat those assurances here. Despite municipal respondents’ doomsday proclamations, incorporation does not imperil every law regulating firearms. Five justices formed the majorities in Heller and McDonald: Scalia, Thomas, Alito, Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Chief Justice John Roberts. All of them remain on the Court today. The Court does not identify how justices vote when granting or denying certiorari petitions, but four votes are required to grant a case. We can therefore logically conclude that at least two justices from the Heller/McDonald majority have refused to take a single Second Amendment case in the last five years. That does not mean that the same two justices voted against hearings in every single case—Alito and Thomas could have voted against some, for example, while Scalia and Kennedy might have voted against others. More than two justices could have also voted against hearings in some cases. In Friedman, for example, Roberts might have voted to hear the case but chosen not to disclose his vote or join Thomas's dissent. And it’s also possible that the entire Heller/McDonald majority is voting to block further Second Amendment cases with the help of one or more dissenters, though that seems unlikely given how many of the denied cases undercut Heller and/or McDonald. If the justices had accepted one or two firearm-related cases or their silence was limited to a single term or two, it would be irresponsible to speculate. But a five-year silence on the Second Amendment amid a number of major cases suggests something deeper is at work. Maybe it’s the high-profile mass shootings since McDonald. Or the rise in shootings in Chicago since they struck down the city’s handgun ban. Or maybe they’re waiting for more consensus to emerge among the federal circuit courts before revisiting the questions. Or maybe they’re just waiting for the right one.",2016-02-14 13:50:03,Supreme Court Declines Case on Assault-Weapons Ban,"law and legislation,suits and litigation,gun control,decisions and verdicts,firearms",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
318,http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2016/02/trump-racist-newsletter-south-carolina," While Sen. Ted Cruz was firing up conservatives at an arena in Greenville, South Carolina, on Thursday night, someone—presumably a supporter of Donald Trump—was leaving copies of a racist far-right newsletter on the windshields of cars parked outside the venue. Here’s the front page: The Conservative Action Report appears to be affiliated with the South Carolina Conservative Action Council, which “proudly” defends the “Confederate South” and the Confederate flag. (This weekend, the group will hold an event to commemorate the Union army’s “satanic” attack on Charleston.) One front-page story in the newsletter is headlined “Is Barack Obama a Muslim?” Another is called “Blacks and the Confederacy—the story the leftist mass media will never tell.” An op-ed in the newsletter refers to Gov. Nikki Haley by her birth name, Nimrada Randhawa, and attacks her for her “Stalinesque” decision to remove the Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds after last year’s mass shooting in Charleston. The newsletter, which endorses Trump and hails his proposed wall along the Mexican border, also slams Cruz (on trade) and Marco Rubio (on immigration). The South Carolina Republican primary this year has so far been bereft of the slanderous whisper campaigns that have marked elections of the past in the Palmetto State. And this isn’t exactly a “dirty trick.” But it is a glimpse of the far extreme of the Trump coalition, which may well carry the Muslim-bashing tycoon to victory on Saturday.

319,http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/14/omar-mateen-was-a-registered-democrat-but/,"Omar Mateen (MySpace via Reuters Pictures) If you’re wondering why the Democrats have been screaming about the NRA ever since the Orlando massacre, it’s because they don’t want to talk about the fact that the shooter was one of their own. Courtesy of Snopes.com, here’s Omar Mateen’s voter registration: Now, you may think that just because Mateen was a registered Democrat, that somehow means Mateen was a registered Democrat. But it’s not that simple, according to Snopes’ Kim LaCapria: What that lone fact means is the subject of a good deal of speculation, with possibilities ranging from Mateen’s being a supporter of Democratic ideology to his simply having chosen a random political affiliation when he initially registered. Mateen didn’t appear on the FBI’s radar until 2013, and it’s possible that in the ten years between 2006 and 2016 his political outlook (whatever it was to begin with) might have changed radically, even if his voter registration did not). In other words, we have a solid fact — Mateen was a registered Democrat — but it makes LaCapria and a lot of other people uncomfortable. So that fact becomes a “Mixture” of true and false. Just because Mateen was a Democrat doesn’t necessarily mean he was a Democrat-Democrat. You see, being a Democrat makes you a good person. How could a Democrat do something so awful? Well then, he probably wasn’t really a Democrat, even though he was definitely a Democrat. And that’s how you “think” like a Democrat. [dcquiz] We’re also learning that Mateen was a regular at that same gay nightclub for years, and he used a gay dating app. So, he was a gay Muslim Democrat. He hit the trifecta of victimhood. That means it has to be the gun’s fault, and the NRA’s fault, and the GOP’s fault, and Christians’ fault, and white people’s fault. It’s everybody’s fault but the gay Muslim Democrat who pulled the trigger. Katie Frates has a terrific piece on this cognitive dissonance among the Democrats. Read the whole thing. Their behavior seems baffling, until you realize that they have to tell themselves these lies just to get through the day. And then they rage at you for reminding them of the truth. If you’re gay and you think the Democrats give a damn about you, you’re wrong. They’re glad to ruin a baker’s life for refusing to make you a wedding cake, but when a Muslim terrorist comes after you for being who you are, you’re on your own. P.S. This weekend’s mass shooting in Orlando is another perfect opportunity for Congress to ignore common sense.https://t.co/2myKeufZrn — Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) June 14, 2016  A gay Muslim Democrat just killed a bunch of people.

          / CBS/AP WASHINGTON -- Some family members of victims and survivors of the San Bernardino attack will file court papers in support of a judge's order that Apple Inc. help the FBI hack into a locked iPhone as part of its investigation, a lawyer and others say. A Los Angeles attorney, Stephen Larson, said he represents at least several families of victims and other employees affected by the attack. He said the U.S. Attorney in the case, Eileen Decker, sought his help. Larson said he will file a brief supporting the Justice Department before March 3. The victims ""have questions that go simply beyond the criminal investigation ... in terms of why this happened, how this happened, why they were targeted, is there anything about them on the iPhone - things that are more of a personal victim"" view, Larson said. Robert Velasco, whose 27-year-old daughter Yvette Velasco was killed in the shooting, told The Associated Press that he didn't have to think long before agreeing to have his name added to the legal filing in support of the FBI. ""It is important to me to have my name in there,"" Velasco said. ""I lost my daughter in this and I want the court to see that I am seeking justice for my daughter."" Velasco said the phone could reveal other extremist plots or that other people were involved in planning the San Bernardino attack. ""The only way to find out is to open up that phone and get in there,"" he said. ""A lot of the families of the victims, we're kind of angry and confused as to why Apple is refusing to do this."" The appeal from victims' family members gives the Justice Department additional support in a case that has sparked a national debate over digital privacy rights and national security interests. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym ordered Apple last week to assist investigators by creating specialized software that would let the FBI rapidly test random passcode combinations to try to unlock the iPhone and view data stored on it. The county-issued iPhone 5C was used by Syed Farook, who with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people at an office holiday party in December before they died in a gun battle with police. The government said they had been at least partly inspired by the Islamic State. The couple physically destroyed two personal phones so completely that the FBI has been unable to recover information from them. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that the FBI's request is ""quite limited in scope"" and called it ""an effective way for the FBI to follow their regular procedure as they conduct this independent investigation, but also stay true to the kinds of principles that the president has discussed publicly about the need for robust encryption methods."" Earnest said the sides needed to hash things out in court and questioned whether Congress - as Apple and others have suggested - would be an effective medium for solving issues evoked by the court order. Farook had worked as a county health inspector. Larson said the government has a strong case because of Farook's diminished privacy interests as a ""dead, murderous terrorist"" and because the phone was owned by his employer, the county government. ""You're weighing that against the interest of enforcement in an investigation and the victims and their interest in obtaining this knowledge,"" he said. Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook has said that creating such software is a dangerous precedent that would threaten data security for millions by making essentially a master key that could later be duplicated and used against other phones. On Tuesday, former Solicitor General Ted Olson, who is representing Apple, said the company has invested heavily to design a secure phone and that if Apple submits to the government pressure in this instance, ""it will happen again and again and again."" Olson served as the government's top lawyer before the Supreme Court during the administration of President George W. Bush. ""We have a constitution and we have civil liberties in this country. Terrorists want to take that away from us,"" he said in an appearance on ""CBS This Morning.""  Gregory Clayborn, whose 27-year-old daughter, Sierra, died in the attack, said he hasn't been asked to join the case but believes Apple is obligated to unlock the phone. ""This makes me a little bit angry with Apple,"" Clayborn said. ""It makes me question their interest in the safety of this country."" Clayborn said he understands Apple's concerns, but unlocking one phone for the FBI, he said, is ""as simple as it gets."" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday expressed his support for Apple while in Barcelona, Spain, to speak at the Mobile World Congress, saying he believes in helping the government in its fight against terrorism but that encryption is important. ""I don't think that back doors into encryption is going to increase security or is in the direction the world is going,"" he said. However, Microsoft founder Bill Gates is siding against Apple - and many other technology companies - in saying the firm should help the U.S. government to hack into the locked iPhone. In an interview with the Financial Times, Gates took the position of the government, denying the case would set a precedent. ""This is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information. They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case,"" the newspaper quotes Gates as saying. ""It is no different than [the question of] should anybody ever have been able to tell the phone company to get information, should anybody be able to get at bank records,"" Gates continued. ""Let's say the bank had tied a ribbon round the disk drive and said 'don't make me cut this ribbon because you'll make me cut it many times.""' Gates also told the Financial Times that, as the newspaper put it, there are ""benefits to the government being able to enforce taxation, stop crime and investigate terror threats, but said there must be rules on when the information can be accessed."" Apple's supporters planned to protest the FBI's demands on Tuesday evening outside Apple's stories in about 50 cities in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Hong Kong. A Pew Research Center survey found that 51 percent of Americans said Apple should unlock the iPhone, while 38 percent said Apple should not - and that it should ensure the security of user information. The remainder gave no opinion. The telephone survey was conducted Feb. 18 through Feb. 21 among 1,002 adults. First published on February 23, 2016 / 11:08 AM © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

          / CBS/AP As police in Redlands, Calif., searched from house to house for suspects in Tuesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino, Americans at home watched something unusual: the tactical use of armored vehicles on a suburban street. Even in a country that regularly experiences mass shootings, the need for either military or non-military armored personnel carriers -- known as MRAPs and Bearcats -- is rare, experts told 48 Hours' Crimesider Wednesday. The vehicles became infamous in 2014 after they were used to quell protests in Ferguson, Mo., sparking an outcry and leading President Barack Obama to issue an executive order in January limiting police access to certain military surplus equipment. In California on Tuesday, they were used as most departments originally planned, to shield the police from people who had already killed and injured dozens, said Jim Bueermann, a former chief of the Redlands Police Department, and current president of the non-profit Police Foundation. ""That usage was exactly what those vehicles were intended to be used for. It was a way to get up to that SUV, where you had an armed person who had just killed a bunch of people, and was shooting at police,"" said Bueermann, whose organization provided recommendations to the White House before it issued its executive order. But Bueermann said one massive military vehicle used Wednesday was out of place, even in a volatile scenario like the one police encountered on the streets of San Bernardino. It's called the MRAP, it's built to withstand a war zone, and it has been provided free-of-charge to some local police departments as part of a program that rids the military of surplus equipment. ""It's not most chiefs' first choice, but they're free,"" said Bueermann, who testified before the Senate in 2014 about the military's surplus program. ""They're not really perfect for police work. Departments get them because they can't afford the hundreds of thousands for a Bearcat."" They also end up spending a lot to adapt them for police work, and to maintain them, said James Stewart, a former director of the National Institute of Justice. Both Stewart and Bueermann said in most places, armored trucks and SWAT teams should be shared among several police departments, instead of each town having its own military-style force. ""If you go to a small town and you have this gigantic thing, you'll find it's expensive just to maintain the tires. They dry out and crack, even when they're not in use"" said Stewart who now directs public safety research for CNA Corporation, an Arlington, Va.-based nonprofit security research firm that advises military and government agencies. ""You find it's a false economy to accept the military's sort of cast off equipment."" Bueermann said that ""false economy"" is what can cause police departments to overuse their armored equipment, leading to scenarios like the one seen in Ferguson, where SWAT teams road atop Bearcats, pointing their guns at protesters. ""You have an armored vehicle or SWAT, and you don't get a lot of use, you're going to get creative in how you use it, because your boss is going to ask why you're spending $80,000 a year,"" Bueermann said. In the day after the San Bernardino attack, police officials as far away from California as Michigan and Virginia highlighted the use of armored vehicles, and criticized the president's executive order limiting their access by police. But Bueermann said the order was ""attempting to strike a balance between the needs of police and the uproar that was coming out of communities."" Among the order's mandates is that police departments have to first receive approval from local legislative bodies, before they can acquire military vehicles. ""If you can't explain to your community why you need a bearcat then you have a problem,"" Bueermann said.

325,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/campaign-2016-final-poll-released-ahead-of-iowa-caucuses-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/,"Watch CBSN Live  Updated on:  January 30, 2016 / 11:32 PM
          / CBS/AP DES MOINES, Iowa -- The last major preference poll before Monday's Iowa caucuses showed a change at the top of the GOP race. The Iowa Poll, published Saturday by The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg, said Republican real estate mogul Donald Trump has the support of 28 perfect of likely caucus goers, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 23 percent and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 15 percent. It's the first time Trump has led this poll since August, pollsters said. Trump's support has risen by six points since early January, and 71 percent of his supporters say their minds are made up. The poll was taken beginning the day after Trump announced he would skip last week's GOP debate. It's not a decision that seems likely to hurt him -- 46 percent of likely caucus goers said they didn't care and 24 percent approved of his decision. Only 29 percent didn't approve.    Should voters have second thoughts, Cruz could benefit -- he leads the group who could change their minds, albeit by a small margin, over Trump and Marco Rubio. A plurality of Ben Carson's voters chose Cruz second. One troubling sign for Cruz, however, is that his favorability, though still quite high, at 65 percent, has dropped 11 percentage points since early January. On the Democratic side, the survey finds former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with 45 percent support to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 42 percent. Both candidates see an increase in support, with Clinton up by three percentage points since early January and Sanders up by two. Clinton leads among voters who say they are certain to caucus, and Sanders has an edge with voters who said they would probably caucus. Three percent of likely Democratic caucus goers chose Martin O'Malley, which shows a drop of a percentage point since January. The poll of 602 likely Republican caucus-goers and 602 likely Democratic caucus-goers was taken Tuesday to Friday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The candidates and their surrogates crisscrossed state Saturday in a frenzied weekend prelude to the first presidential contest of the 2016 race which has taken an unexpected turn with the emergence of outsider candidates who have challenged the establishment in both parties. Iowa offers only a small contingent of the delegates who will determine the nominees at each party's national convention in July. But Monday's caucuses will provide a test of whether the large enthusiastic crowds turning out at rallies for Trump and Sanders will turn into actual votes. The caucuses should also help winnow out the crowded Republican field and provide momentum heading into the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary.     Trump, the showman of the Republican race, made a dramatic entrance to a Dubuque rally as his jet flew low over a hangar half-filled by the waiting crowd and music played from the movie ""Air Force One."" There was more drama inside, as a small group of protesters interrupted him and Trump joined the crowd in chanting ""USA"" to drown out the discord. He asked security to ""get them out"" but ""don't hurt them."" Cruz directed much of his last-gasp advertising against Rubio, as he chugged across the state on a mission to visit all 99 counties before Monday's caucuses. Cruz's ads sharply challenged Rubio's conservative credentials. One ad said darkly of Rubio: ""Tax hikes. Amnesty. The Republican Obama."" ""A deceitful campaign,"" Rubio said in response to Cruz. ""Kitchen sink attacks,"" he said. ""That's what they throw at you."" Asked whether Rubio could win or come second, his senior strategist Todd Harris laughingly responded with an obscenity and said the goal in Iowa is third.     ""There's no question we are feeling some wind at our back,"" Harris told The Associated Press. But, he added, ""It's very hard to compete with the greatest show on earth and the greatest ground game in Iowa history. So we feel very confident that what we need to do here is finish a strong third. I don't care what any of the polls say, Ted Cruz is going to win this caucus."" Rubio is hoping to emerge as the favorite within the establishment wing of the party heading into New Hampshire, where he is trying to fend off challenges from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. In the Democratic race, Sanders spoke for many when at a Manchester rally he called the Democratic contest against Hillary Clinton a likely tossup, to be won and lost according to how many Iowans invest the time and energy to make it to caucus sites at schools, churches and even private homes. ""It's virtually tied,"" Sanders said, a reasonable summation of polls. ""We will win the caucus on Monday night if there is a large voter turnout. We will lose the caucus on Monday night if there is a low voter turnout."" The Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist said ""the eyes of America, in fact much of the world"" would be on Iowa, and the state could be a model for the future of American democracy.     ""When ordinary people, working people, middle class people, seniors, young people become involved in the political process, we can transform this country and we can win here in Iowa,"" Sanders said. Clinton has worked assiduously to avoid a repeat of 2008, when then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama scored a surprise win in Iowa. She finished third in the caucuses and her days as the prohibitive favorite for the nomination faded. She faced the prospect of escalating political heat from revelations Friday that the private email server she used when she was Obama's first secretary of state contained top-secret messages that should have remained within proper, secured channels. That heat was coming from Republicans; Sanders earlier declared the email flap a nonissue in his mind. However, Sanders has raised the issue of the large speaking fees and campaign donations that Clinton has received from leading financial firms and other corporations. At Sanders' Manchester rally, Ruth Lewin, a retired grocery store clerk and child care provider, said the latest news about Clinton's emails reinforced why she will be caucusing for Sanders on Monday. ""It's a matter of honesty, integrity along with other issues I have about her,"" Lewin said.  ""When you get $600,000 for a speaking engagement, I mean that's more than I've made in my entire lifetime."" Clinton emphasized the issue of gun regulations at a rally at Iowa State University in Ames, where she was joined by former Rep, Gabby Giffords, who was severely wounded in a mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly. The former secretary of state drew an implicit contrast between her push for stricter laws with Sanders' mixed record on gun control measures. ""How can we continue to ignore the toll that this is taking on our children and our country?"" Clinton asked. ""When you go to caucus Monday night please think of this."" The Clinton and Sanders campaigns reached agreement to hold a debate in New Hampshire this coming week and three more in the spring, supplementing a light debate schedule that has favored weekend slots when fewer people watch TV.

328,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/working-families-party/422949/,"The Working Families Party has pushed the political debate to the left in the states where it’s already active. Now—in the era of Occupy and Bernie Sanders—it’s ready to take that fight nationwide. At a recent private dinner in Manhattan, a small group of leftists plotted to take over America. The group, a dozen community organizers and activists from all over the country, had convened at a sushi restaurant in the Flatiron District with the leaders of the New York-based Working Families Party. They were heads of organizations from Boston to Albuquerque, with names like National People’s Action and Washington Community Action Network. And they were there to hear why their states should form their own chapters of the insurgent party, in order to capitalize on the country’s rising liberal tide and push the national conversation leftward. The party’s deputy director, Jon Green, a pale, bespectacled 42-year-old, made the pitch. “In 2010, we saw the Tea Party yank the entire political discourse way to the right,” he said. The Tea Party was powerful, he said, because it was boldly ideological; it recruited and groomed candidates; and it created a strong national brand. “Our view is that there isn’t anything analogous to that on the left, and there ought to be.” Heads nodded around the table. The Working Families Party’s agenda—frankly redistributionist and devoted to social equality—targets a class of Democratic elected officials who, in the view of many liberals, seem to listen more to their moneyed donors than to the left-wing rank and file. Aggressive, tactical, and dedicated to winning, the WFP would like to force Democrats—and the country—to become more liberal by mobilizing the party base, changing the terms of the debate, and taking out centrist incumbents in primaries. If there’s ever been a moment for this, it is now. Four years after Occupy Wall Street, with the socialist Bernie Sanders pushing Hillary Clinton leftward in the Democratic presidential primaries, liberal frustration with national politics has reached a boiling point. Enter the WFP: Since its founding nearly two decades ago, it’s become an influential fixture of Democratic politics in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Now, the party is going national. By mid-2016, the WFP plans to be in 11 states, with more on the horizon. Last month, the WFP endorsed Sanders after an online vote of its national membership. They may not yet be a household name, but a few years from now, they aim to be a national force. Many of the activists in the dining room that night were there because they thought their states’ liberals needed more edge. Javier Benavidez is the executive director of the Albuquerque-based South West Organizing Project, a community group that will help to launch the New Mexico Working Families Party later this year. In New Mexico, Benavidez said, labor and community groups had a good relationship. “But when it came to taking on corporate Democrats, there was a lot of hesitation.” Analilia Mejia, the crusading director of New Jersey Working Families, jumped in from across the table. “Here is what you say to them, verbatim: ‘Let us be the “crazy” left,’” she said. “‘Let us be the voice that creates the space that allows you to negotiate for more of what you want.’ You can’t be for raising taxes? Let us say, ‘Tax the rich,’ and then you can push harder.” From Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, to the Black Lives Matter movement and recent social-justice protests on college campuses, the activist left is enjoying a prominence not seen since the 1970s. The largest proportion of Americans now identify as “liberal” since Gallup began asking the question in 1992. As both cause and symptom of this moment, the WFP represents a sign of things to come for a Democratic Party still in the early stages of wrestling over what form it will take in the post-Obama era. Without the WFP, de Blasio, who may be the most powerful progressive in the country, would not likely be mayor. The party’s Chicago partner helped to force Mayor Rahm Emanuel into Chicago’s first-ever mayoral runoff as he sought reelection last year. It played a key role in increasing the number of blacks on the six-member Ferguson, Missouri, city council from one to three in the wake of that city’s police-brutality protests. WFP-supported candidates have defeated incumbent Democrats in legislative primaries in Connecticut, New York, and Oregon, and party-supported candidates serve on city councils from Hartford to Chicago. The party has been instrumental in pushing issues such as government-mandated paid sick leave and a $15 minimum wage to the forefront of the national Democratic agenda. As dinner wound down, the group traded war stories about disloyal Democrats and local fights. Charly Carter, the director of Maryland Working Families, complained that some elected officials seemed to lose the fire in the belly once they took office. “It can be a real letdown,” Carter said. “We are at war. And when you’re at war, you don’t need statesmen—you need gladiators. We elect them to be gladiators, and once they get there they want to be statesmen.” Her tablemates nodded in sympathy. The implication was clear: Their mission was to ensure that Democrats couldn’t get away with selling out their base. The Working Families Party’s bid for national prominence might seem like a long shot. But the party has succeeded in racking up electoral and policy victories in the places where it has long been active, starting with New York. In the Empire State, where it was founded, the WFP is undeniably influential. It’s a force in city politics, but also makes its presence felt in the state legislature. It arose as a result of the state’s unusual fusion-voting system, in which candidates can run on the ballot lines of multiple parties—so, for example, a voter for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg would find him listed on the ballot twice, as the Republican candidate and as the candidate of the Independence Party. The fusion system allows third parties to exert influence on the two established parties, offering them the chance to support major-party candidates rather than playing spoiler. The system has given minor parties an unusual role in New York politics, but while the Conservative Party has generally lived up to its name, the Liberal Party has not: In 1989, it endorsed Republican Rudy Giuliani. The betrayal outraged then-governor Mario Cuomo and prompted a revolt among a group of liberal union leaders and community activists. They formed the New Party in 1990; after some fits and starts, it became the Working Families Party in 1998. The party is controlled and funded by a board consisting of labor unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, and grassroots groups such as Moveon.org; its national president, a garrulous visionary named Dan Cantor, has a résumé that includes the Jesse Jackson presidential campaign and the now-defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN. Success for the nascent WFP came faster than its founders could have dreamed: In the 1998 election, the party’s endorsed gubernatorial candidate, the Democrat Peter Vallone, received more than 50,000 votes on the WFP line (despite losing the race), guaranteeing the party ballot access going forward. It immediately started scoring policy victories: the state’s first county-level living-wage ordinances; a statewide hike in the minimum wage passed over the veto of a Republican governor in 2004; and the first major reforms to the Rockefeller drug laws, set in motion by a WFP-backed African American candidate’s primary defeat of a conservative Democratic district attorney in Albany. In 2003, Letitia James won election to the New York City Council on the WFP line alone, beating the Democratic candidate in the race and becoming the council’s first minor-party representative in 30 years. That planted the seeds of the WFP’s plan to take over the council. By 2009, the party had helped seven challengers win city-council primaries, many of them defeating Democratic incumbents, and backed a progressive councilman named Bill de Blasio’s upset bid for the citywide office of public advocate. Once in office, the WFP-backed council members joined with liberals already on the council to form an 11-member Progressive Caucus which, despite being a minority on the 51-seat council, quickly proved capable of driving the agenda—and tormenting then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Christine Quinn, the city council’s speaker at the time, sided against the WFP on issues like paid sick leave, ending stop-and-frisk, and extending term limits; once seen as Bloomberg’s inevitable successor, Quinn was routed in the 2013 Democratic primary. Today, de Blasio is the mayor of New York, James is the public advocate, the Progressive Caucus numbers 18 members, and the speaker is a former caucus chair named Melissa Mark-Viverito. In short, America’s largest city has gone from being run by a billionaire mayor and a party-machine council to being steered by a progressive mayor and progressive-driven council. In place of debates between Republicans and timid, triangulating Democrats, the fight in New York is now largely between moderates and activists on the left. (Even de Blasio now finds himself to the right of the progressives on the council, particularly on criminal-justice issues.) This is what WFP would like to accomplish nationally—on city councils and county boards, in stage legislatures, and in Congress. “Here’s what I’d say is the bottom line about the Working Families Party,” Patrick Gaspard, the former White House director of political affairs who now serves as the Ambassador to South Africa, told me. As a young New York activist, Gaspard was a founding board member of the WFP. “They have values, they have high capacity for a relatively small organization, and unlike many on the left, they have a habit of winning.” (Gaspard stressed that he was speaking in his personal capacity and not in his current professional role.) The party relies on traditional labor- and community-organizing techniques. It maintains an army of paid canvassers year-round who can quickly mobilize voters for elections or initiatives. And it recruits and trains candidates at the ground level, seeding low-level local offices with sympathizers. In October, in a conference room on an upper floor of a Manhattan skyscraper, I watched a legal assistant named Francena Amparo dial for dollars in her reelection race to the Duchess County Legislature, the 25-person board that governs a Hudson Valley county more than an hour north of the city. “Hi, Wilbur, are you there?” said Amparo, a Bronx-accented 38-year-old with flowing hair and a gap-toothed smile. “It’s Francena, the county legislator from Duchess County. How are you doing?” Amparo had set aside two hours from her workday for fundraising calls—to family, friends, and even her doctor. She worked from a script—“I’m calling because I’m running for reelection and I need a boost in the home stretch”—and generally asked for $50 or $75. If she got a “yes,” she handed the phone to one of the two hipsterish young African American WFP staffers in the room, who took credit-card information and added the donation to a spreadsheet. The most important point in the script, highlighted and underlined and all-caps, was to stop talking once you make the ask—when you wait for the other person to fill the silence, they usually say yes. Amparo’s total fundraising goal was just $7,500, and fewer than 2,000 votes would be cast in the election in November, where she was running as both a Democrat and a Working Families candidate, listed on both ballot lines. The theory behind helping people like Amparo—a working-class, lesbian Latina who never saw herself as a potential officeholder until the WFP came calling—is that when seats open up for state legislature or Congress, it’s these lesser officeholders that the Democratic Party will draw upon. (Many New York politicos say the WFP is more organized and effective than the state Democratic Party, and Democratic candidates routinely draw on WFP staff for their campaigns.) In the municipal elections across New York State in November, 71 of the WFP’s 111 downballot candidates won—including Amparo, who beat her Republican challenger by just 21 votes. But the WFP’s story in New York is more complicated than this simple narrative of triumph. It has had a harder time outside New York City, particularly when it comes to the centrist Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, a skilled tactician who has repeatedly outmaneuvered the left. Fiscally conservative but socially liberal, Cuomo epitomizes the sort of “corporate Democrat” the WFP despises. In his 2010 gubernatorial election, he threatened to refuse to run on the party’s ballot line—a move that would have killed the party’s ballot access—unless the party’s leaders promised not to challenge his first budget. The WFP had no choice but to agree, and it was “incredibly disheartening” to the party’s leaders and supporters to stand by in silence as Cuomo successfully passed a package of tax cuts for corporations and the rich, one former WFP staffer told me. (A party spokesman didn’t dispute that the WFP gave Cuomo a pass on his first budget, but noted that the party successfully fought him later in the year on the expiration of a tax on high earners.) In 2014, when Cuomo stood for reelection, the party had recruited a candidate to challenge him in the Democratic primary—a law professor and Occupy Wall Street leader named Zephyr Teachout. But when it came time for the WFP to make an endorsement and bestow its ballot line, the party was badly divided. Its old ally de Blasio, now the city’s mayor (and, at the time, trying to curry favor with Cuomo to get his own agenda through the legislature), brokered a deal whereby Cuomo would get the WFP endorsement in exchange for a series of promises, such as campaigning for Democratic state-senate candidates and backing ethics and campaign-finance reforms. (Teachout nonetheless won a third of the primary vote, testament to the level of Democratic dissatisfaction with Cuomo.) Cuomo took the deal. But once he got the endorsement, he brazenly reneged, flouting his former promises and even seeking to undermine the WFP by starting a new ballot line called the Women’s Equality Party to confuse voters. In retrospect, WFP insiders view the Cuomo endorsement as a damaging miscalculation. But they take some encouragement from more recent developments: In a deviation from his usual fiscal conservatism, the governor recently came out in favor of a statewide $15 minimum wage. Coming from a pol seen as motivated purely by self-interest, Cuomo’s move was a sign this liberal cause had become a political winner. It is an irony of the Obama era that, despite having a liberal Democrat in the White House, liberals often feel irrelevant to the national political debate. As Analilia Mejia piloted her gray SUV down a New Jersey highway, she considered the question of what ideas are considered politically reasonable. There had just been another mass shooting, at a community college in Oregon, and the president had once again made a speech saying the gun situation was out of hand. On the radio, people were calling in to say that some things that might actually help—taking away people’s handguns, requiring them to register with the government—were obviously ridiculous, out of the question. But why? That’s what Mejia, the director of New Jersey Working Families, wanted to know. A longtime union organizer who actually postponed her wedding to work on the Obama campaign, Mejia had previously served as New Jersey political director of the powerful mid-Atlantic janitors’ union, SEIU 32BJ, whose 145,000 members can be found everywhere from Yankee Stadium to the Pentagon. The daughter of a Colombian garment worker and a Dominican laborer, Mejia, along with her younger sister, spent several early-childhood years with relatives in Venezuela after their father injured his back and could no longer support the family. “It was better to live on poverty-level wages in a shantytown in Venezuela than on a garment-worker’s salary in Elizabeth, New Jersey,” she told me as we inched forward in traffic. “That’s crazypants.” Union work was satisfying but limiting for Mejia. Given the dramatic contraction of the labor movement, which has fallen to just 7 percent of private sector workers (in 1984, it was 16 percent), she longed to improve the lives of all workers, not just those lucky enough to be in a union. (In this sense, the WFP represents a stab at an American labor party, a common feature of European democracies that the U.S. has historically lacked.) The WFP gives activists like Mejia an outlet for their frustration with national politics. It channels their anger at the constricting terms of the national debate into ground-level organizing—where the politics may seem unglamorously small-time, but there’s a chance to make a difference in people’s lives. “We’ve found ways of electoralizing our issues,” Mejia told me. “We make politicians walk the walk—and pay the price if they don’t.” The idea is to make Democratic politicians more accountable to their liberal base through the asymmetric warfare party primaries enable, much as the conservative movement has done to Republicans. “The rules are rigged against working people, so we have to think outside the box to find different ways to win at this game,” Mejia said. When the Democratic-controlled New Jersey Legislature wasn’t advancing a statewide paid-sick-leave bill, the WFP went to the municipal level to find a workaround; 10 New Jersey cities have now mandated paid sick leave. And when Governor Chris Christie vetoed a set of voting reforms—including automatic voter registration and restoring felons’ voting rights—the party set out to collect signatures to put it on the ballot instead, hoping to put the issue before voters in November 2016. Mejia has also spearheaded the party’s role as Christie’s chief harasser—a task the state’s sclerotic, Christie-co-opted Democratic Party originally hesitated to take up. The WFP’s protests, ethics complaints, and calls for Christie’s resignation helped put the Bridgegate scandal on the map, severely wounding the presidential hopes of the man once considered a top 2016 GOP contender. The party also worked to elect Ras Baraka, an opponent of education reform, to succeed Cory Booker as mayor of Newark over a better-funded candidate. (WFP-style liberals generally side with teachers’ unions in viewing education reform, which the Obama administration and many Democrats have championed, as a corporatist plot to undermine public education.) Arriving in West Orange, Mejia pulled up to the venue for the evening’s New Jersey Working Families gala, a banquet hall with a strong Jersey vibe: mirrors, marble, patterned carpet. Bumper stickers reading “Kicking Ass for the Working Class” were available at the check-in table. The evening’s speakers included Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, a liberal New Jersey lawmaker the WFP has championed since she was in the state assembly, and Representative Keith Ellison, the Minnesotan who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. One testament to the party’s growing local clout was that attendees included the chair of the New Jersey Democratic Party, John Currie, and the mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop, whom many local observers expect to be a top Democratic prospect for governor when Christie leaves office in 2017. Just as even mainstream Republican politicians now feel obliged to kowtow to the Tea Party, the WFP, in the states where it is strongest, has begun to bend the Democratic establishment in its direction. “There has been a changing of the guard,” Currie, the chairman, told me. “Many more of our elected officials are very progressive now.” Fulop, whose city was the first in New Jersey and the sixth in the country to adopt paid sick leave, told me the WFP represented the first “collective voice for the middle class” that New Jersey had seen in his memory. Until the party came along, he said, Christie had largely succeeded in a strategy of “divide and conquer” to “get Democrats to give up on our core values in the name of compromise,” such as by agreeing to pension reform. Though he declined to tell me whether he was running for governor, it was clear that he saw cozying up to the WFP as the best way to signal his progressive allegiances in a potential Democratic primary. “The Working Families Party provides a balance,” he said. “That was missing, very much so.” Why would the left want a Tea Party? Mainstream Democrats and Republicans alike tend to see the right-wing movement as a pernicious force that has gridlocked national politics, simultaneously stymieing the president and hurting the GOP’s image. But to the leaders of the WFP, the right-wing movement’s sudden rise was a revelation. “I watched the Tea Party achieve our goal in reverse,” Dan Cantor, the WFP’s national director, told me one day in his New York office. “They were able to pull the country hard to the right without a single ballot line.” The Tea Party showed that you could be a political party-type actor while still operating mainly within the two-party system, through primary challenges and activism. It convinced Cantor that the WFP’s incremental, fusion-based strategy was too limited, and that there were other ways to wring ideological purity from a party that was in the habit of selling out its most loyal supporters. Then, in late 2011, the Occupy Wall Street protest movement erupted across the country. This was another eye-opening jolt for Cantor: “It raised the possibility of a new progressive moment,” he said. The energy, he saw, was there to be tapped—it just needed organizers who knew how to channel it. Organizers, perhaps, like the WFP. The WFP, Cantor explained, doesn’t expect to overthrow the two-party system—nor does it want to be a hopeless cause like the Greens or the Libertarian Party. “Every good idea in American history started with a third party: abolition, the eight-hour day, women’s suffrage, child-labor laws, unemployment insurance, Social Security,” he said. “These didn’t start with the Democratic or Republican Party—they started with the Free Soilers and the Liberty Party and the Populist Party and the Socialist Party. That’s where these things germinate, and then when you do well, they get adopted by one of the major parties, or in very rare cases the major party collapses. “So we’re not naïve,” he continued. “The Democratic Party is not about to collapse. But we think there’s a huge number of people inside the Democratic Party that actually agree with us, and we want the Democratic Party to be feistier, tougher, and more focused on the needs of ordinary people, not the preferences of their donors.” It was in this spirit that the WFP made its presidential endorsement, of Sanders, in December. It was a move that had even some WFP allies scratching their heads: Why align themselves with a presidential candidate who is likely to lose, prompting questions about the WFP’s clout and potentially alienating Hillary Clinton, who has tacked to the left in ways that satisfy many progressives? Clinton has also been endorsed by some of the WFP’s stakeholder unions, putting them in a difficult position. The WFP risked coming across as the Bernie Sanders of political organizations: loud and angry, but ultimately a sideshow. The WFP’s stated goal is to help Sanders win. It decided to back Sanders after a vote by its governing board and an online survey of rank-and-file members, 87 percent of whom chose Sanders. But internally, party members see an upside to the endorsement even if he doesn’t prevail. It’s about expanding the party by tapping the energy Sanders has roused—and giving those new activists somewhere to go once the Sanders campaign has ended. In 2013, the WFP was active in just four states—New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Oregon. Since then, it has opened chapters in Washington, D.C., Maryland, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Rhode Island, with New Mexico expected to join this year. “We wait for people to call us,” Green, the deputy director, who is spearheading the national expansion, told me with a laugh. Usually, they’re people who feel abandoned by their local Democrats. “They’re organizations that used to feel like they had power, mostly labor unions,” Green said. “Public-sector unions used to feel like the Democratic Party had their back. Maybe that wasn’t ever really true, but they’re certainly seeing it’s not true now. And low-income communities that once felt that the Democratic Party was the logical place for them to situate their politics—they see the Democratic Party drifting ever rightward, and being fine with the oppression of black people.” Green has firsthand experience with this process. In 2003, he was the director of the newly formed Connecticut WFP, the party’s first foray outside New York, when leaders of the Democratic-controlled state legislature teamed up with Republican Governor John Rowland on a budget that resulted in layoffs for 2,300 unionized state workers. For the state employees’ union, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, “it was an awakening,” Green told me. It was one thing for the Republican governor to float such a proposal, but the unions had counted on the Democrats to block him. “They felt like, ‘These are the people that have our back. They’re Democrats—they’re going to be there for us.’ And they weren’t.” Elsewhere in the country, the Tea Party is a model for what the WFP is trying to do. But in Connecticut, the WFP predates the Tea Party—and its clout is such that in 2010, when the Tea Party was rising nationally, a Connecticut Tea Party affiliate cited the WFP as an inspiration. The current majority leader of the state House launched his career with WFP backing. In 2009, in the wake of the financial crisis, New York and Connecticut were two of the only states to fill their state budget holes by raising taxes on the rich rather than merely cutting spending. In Connecticut’s 2010 Democratic gubernatorial primary, an underdog mayor named Dan Malloy attacked the front-runner, Ned Lamont, for his opposition to paid sick days, making it the subject of a blitz of TV ads. Lamont, formerly a liberal darling for his 2006 primary defeat of Senator Joe Lieberman, led in the polls right up to the eve of the primary—but Malloy ended up beating him by 14 points. Paid sick days had been proposed but blocked by the Democratic legislature in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Once Malloy took office in 2011, he quickly signed the nation’s first statewide paid-sick-days mandate. There's Something About Bernie These days, Green gets a lot of calls from frustrated liberals looking for a way to pressure the Democratic Party from the left. In Wisconsin, the newly formed WFP wants to oust the Milwaukee County executive, Chris Abele, a wealthy businessman and ostensible Democrat who opposes tax hikes and supports privatizing government services. In Baltimore, the party is training candidates to take on city-council incumbents; in D.C., it is working to put a $15 minimum wage on the ballot. In Chicago, the same election that forced Emanuel into a runoff saw the council’s progressive caucus increase from seven to 11 members. Now, Emanuel faces mass protests and a recall threat for his handling of police violence in the city. The WFP has also succeeded in pushing its pet issues to the forefront of the Democratic agenda. One signature cause is government-mandated paid sick leave, a once-fringe idea that in the past year was mentioned in President Obama’s State of the Union address, presented as a centerpiece of Hillary Clinton’s economic agenda, and championed by Nancy Pelosi. Similarly, the party was an early champion of the $15 minimum wage, once considered unthinkable but now a reality in several large cities. Is all this enough to deserve the “Tea Party of the left” label? That may be premature. Democratic divisions have yet to develop into the sort of government-shuttering national drama of the GOP’s fractures, and the party’s presidential primary has turned into a tedious coronation. The WFP’s victories to date have been numerous but small-bore—a far cry from the Tea Party’s attention-getting mass rallies and defeats of veteran U.S. senators. But the WFP would argue that, with Congress gridlocked and in Republican hands, more effective policymaking happens at the state and local level. The WFP’s focus on municipal office also represents an attempt to leverage Democrats’ concentration in urban areas. Like the Tea Party, the WFP bedevils mainstream Democrats. One Democratic elected official in a jurisdiction where the party is active lamented that its absolutist demands sometimes make governing impossible: “They’re bomb throwers.” But the Tea Party and WFP alike view the traditional mode of bipartisan governance as a corrupt bargain. Making that harder is the whole point. In mid-November, WFP staffers from across the country gathered for their first-ever national gala. Held in a dimly lit foyer of the national AFL-CIO headquarters, two blocks from the White House, the event featured a modest bar and forlorn-looking cheese tray. To one side, an imposing, 1950s-era, gilt-heavy mural of heroic laborers with a motto from Virgil (“Labor Omnia Vincit”); to the other, a canvas banner color-printed with WFP activists, carrying signs like “The Seas Are Rising & So Are We,” “Hands Up Don’t Shoot,” and “I Am a Woman.” A plaque identified the venue as the Samuel Gompers Room. Heather McGhee, the president of the leftist think tank Demos, kicked off the proceedings. “You ain’t seen nothing yet from the Working Families Party,” she said. “We’re electing leaders, we’re winning on issues, and most importantly, we’re changing what’s politically possible.” McGhee, a black woman with long light-brown dreadlocks, ticked off the party’s victories, starting with minimum-wage hikes and paid sick days. “We took down the Rockefeller drug laws, we won police body cameras, and we helped stop the abuse of stop-and-frisk,” she said. “We stood up to the hedge funders who look at our schools and see dollar signs, from Bridgeport to Newark, from Philadelphia to Chicago. “We’ve been working day in and day out to win on these issues and change the debate,” she added. “And this here, tonight, what you’re at, is our coming-out party. Because we are the people who believe that our economy should be measured in the health, happiness, and security of our families, not in corporate profits. We are the people who believe that democracy is for the people, not the super PACs. We are the people who know that economic inequality in America has always been built on the scaffolding of racial injustice.” At this, there was applause and shouts of “Amen!” “We are the people who believe that the future of our planet is worth more than the profits of oil and coal executives,” she added. “And you know what? We deserve a political party, too.” A few minutes later, a slender, elegant, dark-skinned woman in a black silk gown took the stage. She was Diana Richardson, a member of the New York State Assembly from Crown Heights, Brooklyn; in a May special election, she became the first-ever New York state legislator elected solely on the WFP ballot line. Her campaign hinged on railing against gentrification and the “greedy developers” leaving the neighborhood’s historic residents behind. Speaking in a Brooklyn accent of Rosie-Perez-in-White-Men-Can’t-Jump proportions, Richardson proclaimed, “The local Democrats didn’t want someone like me. Listen to my voice—it’s very strong! You can’t push me around.” The audience laughed and cheered. “But another party did want me,” she added. “The Working Families Party.” Richardson exuded a powerful charisma—it was clear why her constituents had seen her as a champion, even if it was also clear why she wouldn't necessarily fit a major-party mold. If the Working Families Party gets its way, the future of the American left will look a lot less like Hillary Clinton—and a lot more like Diana Richardson.",,The Tea Party of the Left,"politics and government,united states politics and government",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

On April 20, 1999, Sue Klebold’s initial reaction to the mass shooting at Columbine was like so many other parents of children at the Colorado high school. “My first thought was Dylan may be in danger,” she told Diane Sawyer on 20/20 on Friday night as part of her first television interview in the nearly 17 years since the shooting. “Who are these people that are hurting people?” But then the news came. It was Dylan, her son, and his friend Eric Harris wielding the guns. She began hyperventilating, she said, trying to talk herself down. “The police were there, and the helicopters were going over, and I remember thinking, ‘If this is true, if Dylan is really hurting people, somehow, he has to be stopped,’” she told Sawyer. “At that moment, I prayed that he would die. That God, stop this! Just make it stop—don’t let him hurt anybody.” Her eyes welled up. She bit her lip on the last line, and stared ahead, silent, quivering. That admission, the most breath-taking of the hour, wasn't actually new. Sue Klebold had previously confessed that ghastly prayer to Andrew Solomon, in slightly different words, in an interview for his remarkable 2012 book, Far From the Tree. I recall my incredulity when I first read it then: Hard to believe a mom could even think that way. Did I believe her? Yes. So disarmingly candid—but it was a struggle. Hard as I tried, I couldn't picture her actually saying it. I could not picture Sue at all. I accepted it as an act of faith. On Friday night, watching Klebold try to hold it together, grasping for the Kleenex box at moments, doubt never even nudged me. I saw a complete mom. All the peculiar fragments of Sue Klebold fit now. That’s the power of TV. Despite covering the shootings for nearly 17 years on and off, and spending several hours on the phone with her last February when she interviewed me for her own book, I now had a solid image of her. Previously, I had only caught sight of her a few times in the media. A scared, ashen-faced shot of her in 2003, when all four Harris and Klebold parents met in a downtown Denver courthouse to be privately deposed in the case. (We will read their answers in 2027—a judge ordered them sealed until that date.) At the time, a prominent Denver journalist described the crush of paparazzi there to snatch photos of the parents—only to discover no one seemed to know what they looked like. The blind fascination was understandable. They occupied a new, if tragically growing, rank in the American consciousness—School Shooter’s Parents. Sue Klebold and Kathy Harris were two of the earliest, and most notorious members. A prominent poll showed 83 percent of Americans placed blame partly on the women and their husbands for Columbine. Rev. Don Marxhausen, who performed Dylan‘s secret funeral, famously described Tom and Sue Klebold as “the loneliest people on the planet.” Sue has actually come to us in startling glimpses in text three times before Friday night: a David Brooks column in the New York Times in 2004, her own O Magazine essay in 2009, and a chapter in Solomon's book, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction. Finally now, she is telling her whole story, in her book A Mother's Reckoning, to be published by Crown on Tuesday, thus the 20/20 interview. Sue Klebold had no big bombshells left to drop about who Dylan was, or what drove him. Most of what we’re likely to ever know has already been told. But in the Sawyer interview, she offered an onslaught of shocking details and stirring insights, and in the process provided one thing we have been waiting for all these years: a gripping portrait of what it was like to witness a slow, fitful descent to murder, and the parallel vision of what she thought she was witnessing at the time. We saw the agony of a mom living with those two visions of her boy, struggling to reconcile them even now, too late to stop him. All the evidence points to the charming but sadistic Eric Harris as the driving force behind the attack. Dylan was the shy follower, descending into debilitating depression. Both of them hid those qualities, from Sue and nearly every adult that mattered. After the murders, Sue and Tom fled their home briefly, she said, and she thought about moving and changing her name. “I can’t run from this,” she decided, and several weeks after the tragedy she returned to work helping disabled community college students. “I would turn on a radio and people would be talking about me and calling me a disgusting person,” she said. She confided to a journal that she worried she was losing her link to sanity. Later, she wrote, “All I want to do is die.” The biggest impact to her family, Sue delivered off-camera. Sawyer conveyed it halfway through the show. After nearly 30 years of marriage, Sue and Tom divorced: “driven in different directions, by grief,” Sawyer said. A marriage so private, we were unaware it no longer existed. That privacy likely changed for Sue Klebold last night. She could walk anonymously through Safeway or sit quietly undisturbed inside the Columbine Memorial, as she has so many times. Never again. Sue also revealed that she was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years after the murders, and it was that fight that helped her put the despair behind her and regain the will to live. “I can’t, I can’t stay with this level of intensity,” she said. ""I have to let some of it rest and say, ‘I didn’t kill these people! Dylan did—it wasn’t me!” It was a rare flash of anger. She clenched her fist as she spit out his name, and then wilted, dabbing a crumbled tissue under her nose. It’s the same idea, essentially, that she tried to convey to David Brooks 12 years ago, that got her in so much trouble with some of the survivors. Brooks flew out to interview Tom and Sue in 2004, and summarized a wide range of responses in an 800-word column. It was clearly sympathetic, and Brooks told me privately at the time that he was impressed by couple. The column included this paragraph: The most infuriating incident, Susan said, came when somebody said, “I
forgive you for what you've done.” Susan insists, “I haven't done
anything for which I need forgiveness.” That quote rankled some of the families. It didn’t seem very humble. And it was still bothering a few when I checked in throughout the last week. Overall, their anxiety was high, but most were supportive, even gushingly so. Again, her assertion that she hadn’t killed anyone wasn’t necessarily a new idea, but on Friday, but she showed us how she got there. Completely different effect. And she showed us she got angry at Dylan too. That probably helped. Though she spent most of the interview discussing Dylan, it was Sue who finally came into focus last night. But she filled in a few blanks on Dylan, too—gradations of the portrait previously undisclosed.  I was shocked to hear how unrepentant he was about his felony arrest for breaking into a van a year before the murders. Based on the prior evidence, including the lengthy police file, I had pictured Dylan cowed. But Sue said he acted like he had done nothing wrong. She lectured him, tried reason, even the Ten Commandments, but he was unmoved. She revoked privileges. Sue did not elaborate on the punishment last night, but I previously reported that both boys were grounded for a month, and forbidden contact with each other for awhile. (Eric also had computer access revoked.) ABC played video of Dylan shot the same day as the break-in in January 1998, which I’d never seen before. (The broadcast did not say who provided the tape.) It is startling how ordinary Dylan appears in it, smiling and joking around. It struck me that in all the footage I've seen of Dylan, this was the first where he seemed so blissful and unaffected. Much of the video released by authorities came from short fictional films where the boys were acting, but even in the real-life moments they captured driving around, they were very aware of the camera. (If this is more representative of Dylan, and there is more video like that, release it, please.) Retired FBI profiler Mary Ellen O’Toole provided expert guidance throughout the broadcast. O’Toole authored the Bureau’s school shooter report and is widely regarded as one of the smartest people alive on such perpetrators. I spoke to both her and Jefferson County's lead investigator Kate Battan by email Saturday morning, and neither recalled seeing that video before. O’Toole was as stunned as I was by how different Dylan appeared: relaxed and casual and comfortable on camera. He also looked older and more mature to both of us—despite actually being a bit younger. Was that the real Dylan? She's going to watch it again. I was also surprised hearing Sue Klebold, who appeared so gentle now, describe a fit of anger she unleashed on Dylan a few months after the arrest. He was withdrawn, skipping out on his chores and she decided he needed some discipline, so she pushed him up against the refrigerator and yelled: “‘You’ve got to stop being so selfish!’ I gave him the old mom lecture, and then I said, ‘And by the way, today’s Mother’s Day, and you forgot it!’” She choked up on Mother's Day, and fought to compose herself, whimpering into her hand. It was a somewhat confusing story, with edits, but the gist seemed to be that Dylan pleaded with her not to push him too hard, and she wondered if she had. Then he got her a little gift of African Violets. “I thought everything was fine—because he was so . . .” She sobbed and smashed her fist against her forehead. “He was so sweet!” Dylan's sweetness is unmistakable in the journal he kept periodically for the last two years of his life. All that is well known. The journal was released in 2006. (I've scanned a few dozen pages from it here.) We know how well Dylan hid this from his friends. Most were forthcoming in their police reports, also released years ago. Last night we discovered how well he had hidden it from his family, too. One of the most interesting elements of the Sawyer interview, was the tale of two journals. Sue, as noted, had been keeping one as well. Sue, after Dylan's sophomore year: “Things have been really happy this summer. Dylan is yukking it up and having a great time with friends.” Dylan had been contemplating suicide for months in his journal and wrote in July, “i feel so lonely, w/o a friend."" Sue also answered a question I get asked relentlessly about her by other moms: Why wasn't she searching through his room? She said she had looked through his things most of his life, but senior year, she decided to respect his privacy. She said she regrets that now, desperately, though I’m not sure what she would have found, particularly if Dylan knew she were snooping. All the evidence suggests that Eric Harris had collected the equipment, assembled the pipe bombs and tested out various napalm recipes and so forth, and seems to have done most or all of it at his house. One of the biggest curiosities about the Klebold and Harris families is whether they confer with each other—I get asked that all the time. Now, we have an answer. Yes, periodically, Sue said, though she didn't feel comfortable representing them, and wanted to respect their privacy. One of Sue's more jarring revelations was that Dylan asked her to buy him a gun. She scoffed and declined, and said she did not permit guns in her house. Before the broadcast had even ended last night, I had gotten my first appalled tweet: “Red flags everywhere that were missed.” But this is Colorado. Lots of teen boys have guns. It's not necessarily a sign of something nefarious. Throughout the interview, Sawyer ceded not just center stage but nearly all of it to Klebold. Sawyer got her talking, and then mostly retreated into the background. Klebold was pretty introspective without prodding, but Sawyer knew when to interject. Right at the beginning, Klebold expressed how sorry she was to the other families, and lamented how inadequate that was. “There is never a day that goes by where I don’t think of the people
that Dylan harmed. And I—” “You use the word harmed.” “Harmed. I think it’s easier for me to say harmed, than killed. And
it's still hard for me, after all this time.” “Is that about a certain need to deny what happened, or . . .?” “I don’t know. Perhaps. Perhaps. It is very hard to live with the fact
that someone loved and raised has brutally killed people.” Klebold has met with at least three sets of victims’ families, which I first reported in 2010. She ended the interview by extending that offer to the others—or anything else that would help. “I don't want to impose myself,” she said, a bit meekly. The program closed with Klebold filmed in the serenity of the Columbine Memorial, a short walk from the school in spacious Clement Park. She likes to visit there alone from time to time, unrecognized, yet a bit unsettled. “I feel kind of unwelcome there,” she said. “That perhaps I’m intruding. . . . Sometimes I just sit there, and think. And I tell them 'I’m sorry.' But . . . yeah.” She trailed off. Correction (9:12 P.M.): As first published, this article misidentified which boy asked Sue Klebold to buy him a gun. It was Dylan.

Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Recode. Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Re/code by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Re/code. Apple has drawn a line in the sand over keeping its customers’ iPhones encrypted and secure. It’s fighting the FBI in a California court over the Bureau’s demand that it create a special, weaker version of iOS that would make it easier for government computers to crack the passcode on a phone and thus reveal its contents. This week, the company won a big victory when a federal judge in New York strongly upheld its objections in a similar case. But the battle is far from over and is likely to be settled in either the Supreme Court or Congress. The special software sought by the FBI — which Apple, with its marketing flair, is calling ""GovtOS"" — is, in essence, a backdoor to the encrypted phone, because the passcode is the user’s encryption key, and Apple has deliberately designed the iPhone so the company itself lacks any other key to decrypt it. Even before the court order in California ignited the current fight, I opposed the idea of any encryption backdoor on grounds that it could also help criminals and repressive foreign governments. And I stand with Apple in its dispute with the FBI over the demand for special passcode-cracking software, for the same reasons. But there’s an exception, a loophole, in Apple’s unyielding stance on privacy and encryption: its iCloud service, and, specifically, iCloud Backup — the convenient and comforting automatic way in which iPhones and iPads back themselves up to the cloud daily. Unlike the iPhone hardware itself, Apple retains the ability to decrypt most of what’s in an iCloud backup. And the company on occasion turns the contents of iCloud backups over to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies when a proper legal warrant or court order is presented. In fact, in the California case, which involved an iPhone used by a terrorist in a horrific mass shooting, Apple gave the FBI the last iCloud backup it had for the phone, which was made about six weeks before the attack. It has said that a fresh iCloud backup would have given the FBI what it needed (it turned out that, due to a password change by local authorities, a fresh backup wasn’t possible. The FBI disputes that the backup would have been sufficient.) Not only that, but if you use other companies’ cloud services on your Apple device, anything you store on most of them as well may either be unencrypted or subject to decryption by keys the provider holds. And all cloud services are potentially vulnerable to things like phishing attacks, password-reset tricks, and of course major hacks and attacks. For instance, celebrity nude photos stored on iCloud were leaked via a targeted attack on user credentials in 2014, even though Apple denied the attack involved a ""breach"" of iCloud. And too few people use two-factor authentication, offered by Apple and many others, which adds an extra layer of security. One solution to maximizing your security: back up your iPhone locally. Why does Apple treat iCloud differently from the phone itself? According to an Apple official familiar with the company’s philosophy on privacy, Apple sees the privacy and security issues with the phone itself as being different from those surrounding iCloud. The company says its security policies for the phone are based on the fact that it’s a physical object that can be lost or stolen, so the need to protect the mass of personal data a typical iPhone contains compels the strongest possible measures. However, in the case of iCloud, while security must also be strong, Apple says it must leave itself the ability to help the user restore their data, since that’s a key purpose of the service. This difference also helps dictate Apple’s response to law enforcement requests. The company’s position is that it will provide whatever relevant information it has to government agencies with proper, legal requests. However, it says, it doesn’t have the information needed to open a passcode-protected iPhone, so it has nothing to give. In the case of iCloud backups, however, it can access the information, so it can comply. This isn’t so different from the position of some other companies. I asked a Google spokesman, Aaron Stein, if Google can turn over a user’s data from Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Calendar. He emailed: ""We are able to comply with valid legal requests [for] data in Gmail, Drive, Docs [and] Calendar."" In a further email, he elaborated: ""If we get a valid legal request from law enforcement (for example, a warrant), we're able to decrypt this data and provide it. In other words, Google retains a 'key.'"" But, he added, echoing Apple: ""That's to be distinguished from a full-device encrypted Android phone, for example. Even if we get a valid legal request in that case, we're not able to remove data that is stored locally on that device and provide it. Only the device owner has a key; Google doesn't."" And Dropbox states: ""Like most online services, we have a small number of employees who must be able to access user data for the reasons stated in our privacy policy (e.g., when legally required to do so). But that's the rare exception, not the rule."" What exactly is in an iCloud backup? In an interview with ABC News, Apple CEO Tim Cook said ""you can think of it as making a picture of almost everything on the phone — not everything, but almost everything."" According to the company, some things aren’t included in iCloud backups because it’s assumed the user can easily restore them via other means. These things include email stored on servers and cached content that can be easily restored, like books stored by the Amazon Kindle app. In a few other cases, information in iCloud backups is considered so sensitive that, like information on the phone itself, Apple includes it but can’t decrypt it. Such things include Wi-Fi passwords, Apple Keychains (encrypted collections of passwords) and passwords for third-party services. But, in general, an iCloud backup is, as Mr. Cook says, a good picture of what the phone contains. For instance, any iMessages and texts stored on the device are backed up and can be decrypted. (This only refers to messages you save on the phone, not those in transit or ""at rest"" on the end server. Apple can’t get your texts if you delete them before a backup.) I don’t want to give the impression that Apple turns over iCloud backup data to governments frequently or casually. Apple’s published explainer on government data requests says only 6 percent of them were related to account information, versus stolen phones. It adds that ""Not only are a minuscule number of accounts actually affected by information requests, but our stringent review meant Apple only disclosed content in response to 27 percent of the total US account requests we received during the period from July 1st, 2014 to June 30th, 2015."" But what if you’d rather not trust Apple with your backup, for any reason? You can take your iPhone’s backup out of Apple’s hands, by doing it the old-fashioned way, via a cable and a Mac or PC. As most of you know, you can back up an iPhone or iPad locally, to your own computer, using Apple’s iTunes program. In fact, that was the only way to back up your iPhone before Apple introduced iCloud Backup in iOS 5 in 2011. It was originally introduced with the iPod many years before. This method is clumsy, slow, and requires you to remember to use it. But it still works. You can even opt to encrypt this local backup. And it keeps the contents of your phone available for restoring, but out of the cloud and out of Apple’s control. Of course, using a local backup won’t and shouldn’t shield your data from a legitimate US law enforcement request. The government would just have to serve its papers on you, instead of Apple. And I am in no way advocating any solution that would evade a properly executed court order. But there’s no doubt that iCloud backups, and other cloud services, while convenient, aren’t as secure as the latest iPhones are. So this might be a good time to review your use of iCloud and other cloud services, and reconsider your own balance of convenience, security and privacy. And you should definitely turn on two-factor authentication.  Subscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.

331,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/technology/apple-unlock-iphone-fbi-san-bernardino-brief.html?ref=technology&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by By Katie Benner, Eric Lichtblau and Nick Wingfield SAN FRANCISCO — The legal wrangling over a federal court order requiring Apple to help law enforcement break into an iPhone intensified Thursday, with the company filing its formal response and asking the court to drop its demand. Other technology companies — Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo — also moved to throw their weight behind Apple in court. The companies said they planned to file one or more briefs backing Apple next week in federal court in California. The flurry of legal activity by the companies came as the F.B.I. also escalated the matter, calling on Congress to settle the question of when law enforcement should get access to citizens’ private data. Apple earlier this week had also asked for Congress to step in. “The larger question isn’t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn’t be,” James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. director, said in a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee earlier on Thursday. “It’s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.” The day’s events were among the most active yet in a case set in motion last week by Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California. Judge Pym ordered Apple to weaken its security functions so the United States government could unlock the iPhone used by one of the gunmen in a mass shooting in December in San Bernardino, Calif., to help the investigation. Apple immediately said it opposed the order, prompting a heated back-and-forth in a situation fueling a debate over privacy and civil liberties versus security. The fight is an important moment in the growing tension between tech companies that have access to huge amounts of private customer data and the government, which has long sought greater access to that information. Apple has said customer data must remain accessible only to customers to protect their civil liberties. Law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey say that increasingly robust encryption technology is hurting their ability to fight criminals. The case may eventually end up before the Supreme Court. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has said, “We would be prepared to take this issue all the way.” In Apple’s formal response to the court on Thursday, which was filed a day ahead of a Friday deadline, the company said the court should drop its order because it oversteps an existing law known as the All Writs Act, as well as Apple’s First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights. “Apple strongly supports, and will continue to support, the efforts of law enforcement in pursuing justice against terrorists and other criminals — just as it has in this case and many others,” the company said in its filing, known as a motion to vacate. “But the unprecedented order requested by the government finds no support in the law and would violate the Constitution.” Apple added that the order had broad implications that would “inflict significant harm — to civil liberties, society and national security — and would pre-empt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the president.” Specifically, Apple argued that the All Writs Act, a statute from 1789 that the government has used in the past to request user data from Apple, does not give the court the power it seeks in this case. While the F.B.I. has previously used the All Writs Act to obtain information from Apple, the company said “Congress has never authorized judges to compel innocent third parties to provide decryption services to the F.B.I.” A Justice Department spokeswoman said investigators had long held the power to secure court orders that compel outside parties like Apple to assist with search warrants. “The Justice Department’s approach to investigating and prosecuting crimes has remained the same,” said Melanie Newman, the department spokeswoman. “The change has come in Apple’s recent decision to reverse its longstanding cooperation in complying with All Writs Act orders.” Apple also argued that if the government forced it to create new code to unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino gunman, that would amount to “compelled speech and viewpoint discrimination,” both of which are violations of the First Amendment right to free speech. The company also said the court order violated the company’s Fifth Amendment right to due process because it deprives Apple of the right to be free from “arbitrary deprivation” of its liberty by government. Legal experts said it was unlikely that a judge would rely on constitutional arguments to make a decision in this early stage. “But given the likelihood that this will move to an appeals court and even further, Apple needs to include all of its arguments in the lower court if it wants to raise them again in a higher court,” said Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy. Even as Apple was preparing to formally respond to the court, other technology companies — which have until now been cautious in their support of Apple — were preparing to be more forceful in court. Earlier Thursday, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, speaking at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, said the software maker would file a brief backing Apple next week. Mr. Smith in particular took aim at the All Writs Act, which was passed in its current form in 1911, as being too antiquated to be used now in situations with modern technology. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, he placed on a table an adding machine from the early 1900s that he had purchased on eBay. “The leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,” he said. Press officials from Google, Facebook and Twitter confirmed that the tech companies would be filing a joint brief supporting Apple. Yahoo said it also would file a brief. Last week, Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, wrote on Twitter that law enforcement demands to hack customer devices and data “could be a troubling precedent.” Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, also wrote on Twitter in support of Apple. This week, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, also said he supported Apple. “I don’t think building back doors is the way to go, so we’re pretty sympathetic to Tim and Apple,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. It is unlikely that a divided, gridlocked Congress will offer clear answers to questions about security and privacy anytime soon. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey on Thursday said that they weren’t sure where to draw the line between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement. Obama administration officials had drafted legislation in 2011 that sought to address the privacy issues now being raised, but the proposals were effectively shelved after the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden leaked information about the government’s mass surveillance programs. Next Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing titled “The Encryption Tightrope: Balancing Americans’ Security and Privacy.” Those set to testify include Bruce Sewell, Apple’s general counsel, along with Mr. Comey and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R.

333,https://www.thewrap.com/apple-vs-fbi-6-testy-moments-from-congress-five-hour-slugfest/,"A marathon Capitol Hill hearing spurred talk of guard dogs, picked locks and that mysterious missing Malaysian plane Getty Images Apple and the FBI made it clear that even after weeks of debating a terrorist's locked iPhone, they haven't run out of things to say. In a hearing that stretched five hours, U.S. representatives on the House Judiciary Committee grilled FBI Director James Comey and Apple General Counsel Bruce Sewell Tuesday about their standoff. The fight pits the world's most valuable company against investigators digging for clues in the country's deadliest mass shooting in years. At the heart of the debate is an iPhone used by one of the shooters in December's San Bernardino, California, attack, which killed 14 people. Earlier this month, the FBI and the Department of Justice secured a federal order forcing Apple to help law enforcement bypass security protections on the device. Apple cried foul, saying it would be compelled to create programming that could put the privacy of millions of consumers at risk. Also Read: Apple vs. FBI: Different Judge Says Apple Is Right Also Read: Apple vs. FBI: Different Judge Says Apple Is Right Tuesday, both sides and a bevy of lawmakers got a chance to rehash the arguments, air grievances and grandstand to the public. Here are some of the most noteworthy moments from the hearing: Apple has repeatedly said the federal order would essentially force it to build a backdoor into iPhones, which the government could potentially use in unintended ways and which malicious third parties could exploit to hack into any iPhone users' data. Comey dismissed that. ""There already is a door on that iPhone,"" he said. ""We're asking [Apple] to take away the guard dog so we can pick the lock.""

A panel of experts on cybersecurity and law enforcement weighed in as well. Manhattan district attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. highlighted the potential criminal repercussions of encryption, which scrambles digital information so that's its indecipherable without a key to decode it. Vance called Apple's iOS 8 operational programming ""warrant-proof,"" creating zones of information even search warrants cannot access. It's something criminals exploit, he said. ""They are quite literally laughing at us, and they are astounded they have a means of communication totally secure from government reach,"" he said.

""When the Malaysia Airline plane went down, within one hour of that plane being declared missing, we had Apple operators cooperating with telephone providers all over the world, with the airlines and with local law enforcement [and] the FBI to try to find a ping, to try to find some way we could locate where that plane was,"" he said.

Police received the initial call at 4:43 a.m., reporting an active shooter at a house near 51st Avenue and Cactus Road. Before midmorning, all five family members would be pronounced dead and swaths of the tri-level house would be reduced to ashes. Dead were Vic Buckner, 50, and Kimberly Buckner, 49, husband and wife, and their daughters Kaitlin, 18, and Emma, 6. The suspected shooter, Vic and Kimberly’s 26-year-old son, Alex, was fatally shot by police after a confrontation inside the home. A police spokesman said Alex had leveled his weapon at officers, but it was unclear whether he unloaded any rounds before he was struck. AZCENTRAL Montini: Another mass shooting to shrug off? Police on Tuesday evening were still searching for a motive in the rampage, and by 5 p.m. were just beginning to execute a search warrant inside the scorched house. Sgt. Trent Crump, a spokesman for Phoenix police, said Alex had no notable criminal history and no documented history of mental illness. Some family members had, however, told police that Alex had a history of drug abuse that had “changed him,” but not to the extent that they could foresee this type of violence. “They didn’t see this coming,” Crump said. “It wasn’t one of those (instances) where they were worried or concerned about it.” The family's dog, Bob, was rescued from the 2,360-square-foot home. The dog was trembling but seemed uninjured when he was carried away from the house by an investigator midmorning and handed off to a relative. The relative declined to comment. Diana Marie Buckner was shocked to learn about the tragedy that took the lives of her grandchildren, son and daughter-in-law. “Vic and his wife loved their children more than anything,” she said. “They lived in a house that was full of love.” Diana is Vic’s stepmother, and married his father, Arthur, nearly 50 years ago. Diana, who lives in the rural eastern Nevada town of Ely, reviewed the Buckners' history. She said the family lived in Nevada when her granddaughter Kaitilin was born. Kimberly worked in the front office of a medical clinic, and Vic was maintenance man for a school district. The family moved to Oklahoma, where Vic took a job with AAA and the family settled in a Tulsa suburb, Owasso, before relocating to metro Phoenix earlier this decade. Family dog, Bob, was rescued from north #Phoenix home this morning after fire, 5-person shooting pic.twitter.com/0LlW7nv9BE They returned to metro Phoenix to be closer to Kimberly Buckner’s family, Diana said. Vic Buckner again held a position at AAA before taking a job with his current employer, Ducts Inc., a heating and air-conditioning installation and repair business based in west Phoenix. They bought a house in the 4800 block of West Sunnyside Avenue in February 2013. Diana Buckner said that her grandson, Alex, had been diagnosed with a behavioral-health condition about the time he graduated from high school. While he struggled at times, she said, he was able to hold a job as a truck driver. “He was a responsible person,” she said. “I just don’t know what happened recently to create this.” Diana said her two granddaughters were extremely close despite the age difference. The older granddaughter was a doting, loving big sister, Diana said, recalling a family trip to Southern California about two years ago. The Buckners visited Universal Studios, attended a baseball game and relaxed on the beach. “We had a really nice time with all the family,” she said. “I didn’t realize it would be the last moment of joy we’d all have together.” On the west side of Sunnyside Avenue, a group of five young women stood outside the police barricade Tuesday night. They had been student assistants at the preschool program at Moon Valley High School that Emma had attended two years ago.Sylvia Avila, 19, and Paulina Bustamante, 18, remembered the girl as a spirited child who wanted to be a ballerina. They said the family was happy and loving but knew little of the child's older brother. Both young women described Kimberly Buckner as being a nurturing figure who was ""always willing to help out"" and encouraged them to seek opportunities in school and financial aid for their studies. They said the victims were like family. ""I've never had someone so close to me pass away,"" Bustamante said. ""I don't know how it's going to be without them around."" Emma celebrated her sixth birthday last month, they said. Bustamante added she babysat the child and brought her along for shopping trips and eating out in addition to helping her as a student teacher once a week during the preschool program. Avila said she never expected anything like this to happen. ""It literally seemed like they had no problems. Domestic violence is something I would not expect."" Neighbors interviewed by police after the shootings reported hearing an argument 30 minutes before police were called to the house, Crump, the Phoenix police spokesman, said. Tuesday’s attack is believed to be the city’s most lethal shooting spree since April 2015, when another Phoenix family was gunned down by one of its own. The shooter, Driss Diaeddinn, turned the gun on himself after killing brothers Dodi Fayed, 56, and Reda Diaeddinn, 38, his mother, Kenza Benzakour, 76, and his sister-in-law, 26-year-old Meriem Ben Yahia. The massacre was reportedly sparked by a dispute over how to run the family’s limousine business. Whether Tuesday’s attack is considered a mass shooting depends on who you ask, as there are various definitions on what types of incidents qualify. MassShootingTracker.org, a popular crowd-sourced database of incidents, defines a mass shooting as four or more people killed or injured by gunfire, including the shooter. Mother Jones includes only incidents in which at least four people are killed, and that occur in public places. Anti-gun-violence organization EveryTown for Gun Safety tracks mass shootings using the FBI definition — at least four people murdered with a gun. In a study of 133 mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2015, the organization found that 57 percent were related to domestic violence, according to research director Ted Alcorn. The organization continues to maintain the database since the study. “Today marks the 144th mass shooting,” Alcorn said.

An Indianapolis man only identified only as Derek, told NPR he, his wife and his parents-in-law got a ride from a local brewery to a hotel after midnight Saturday. Dalton was apprehended by police at 12:40 a.m. in downtown Kalamazoo. Derek and his family, after hearing of a shooter in the area, decided it was better to take an Uber instead of walking back to their hotel after attending a show at Bell's Eccentric Cafe, his mother-in-law, Sheri Casper of Auburn, Ind., told MLive and The Kalamazoo Gazette. ""I jokingly said to the driver, 'You aren't the shooter, are you?' And he either shook his head or said no, and I said, 'Are you sure?' And his response wasn't like what you would expect, like a laugh, like a 'No, not me.' It was just very calm and quiet. 'I'm just tired. No, I'm just tired,'"" NPR reported. The man's reported experience with Dalton wasn't the only customer experience with the mass shooting suspect on Saturday. A Kalamazoo man said he got a ride from the suspect between shootings, and a woman posted a warning to others after she said Dalton drove erratically with her fiance in the vehicle shortly before the shootings started. Uber confirmed Dalton was a driver-partner with Uber who had passed a background check. ""We are horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence in Kalamazoo, Mich.,"" Joe Sullivan, chief security officer at Uber said.

KALAMAZOO, MI -- A Facebook post claiming the suspect in a shooting rampage was an Uber driver and was giving people rides around the times of the Saturday evening shootings is being shared widely. Mackenzie Waite posted on Facebook at 5:33 p.m. that a driver by the name of Jason who matches the description of the suspect was ""not a safe ride."" Jason Brian Dalton, 45, of Cooper Township, was arrested around 12:40 a.m. Sunday after reports of a man driving around Kalamazoo County and shooting people at three different scenes. In all, six people died and two people were injured in the spree that lasted more than six hours. Waite's post was just a half hour before the first shooting was reported, where a woman was shot in a townhome parking lot at about 6 p.m. in Richland Township. Waite said her fiance got a ride with him and he was ""driving VERY erratically."" ""They sideswiped a car blowing through the stop sign at Henderson Castle and West Main Hill, and the driver continued driving,"" Waite wrote. ""Then this man proceeded to drive 80 mph down West Main swerving in and out of oncoming traffic."" Waite posted that the man was acting ""completely normal"" while driving erratically, and that her fiance pleaded with the driver to pull over but he refused. ""911 was called but surprisingly they didn't seem all that concerned,"" Waite wrote. ""I'm thankful that no one was hurt yet. Hoping this man will be arrested or hospitalized soon if he has a medical condition causing his behavior."" This photo of the Uber driver appears to be Jason Dalton, suspect in Kalamazoo mass shooting. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said Sunday that he would not comment on the post, other than confirming law enforcement knows about it. ""We've seen the Facebook post,"" Getting said. ""Law enforcement is aware of it."" Getting continued, ""There's a lot about this. Everyone's in a hurry to hear as much as they can as fast as they can. I get the frustration and the desire (to know) but we've got to make sure we do this the right way,"" he said of the investigation in Dalton and the shooting spree.

Tyler Smith, 17, was killed in the parking lot of Seelye Kia, 4102 Stadium Drive, along with his father, Richard, said Robin Buchler, Mattawan school district superintendent. The father, 53, and son were looking at cars shortly before 10:30 p.m. when police say Jason Brian Dalton shot and killed them in a parking lot. It was the second of three shooting scenes in Kalamazoo County where, police say, Dalton shot eight people, killing six and injuring two. Buchler said social media is ""exploding"" with Mattawan students expressing disbelief about Smith's death. ""We have a lot of kids that are just really panicking a bit,"" Buchler said. ""It just doesn't make sense to them. There's just a feeling of fear and not wanting to really venture out right now. I think it's just because there's just no logic that it would happen."" Smith has been a student at Mattawan schools since eighth grade. Buchler said he's enrolled in the marketing entrepreneurship program at the tech center and also at the high school Buchler said her son, also a senior, had a senior seminar class with Smith. ""He was really a great kid and really well liked,"" Buchler said. ""It's just so traumatic, just heartbreaking."" Buchler said she will meet with her crisis team from the school district this afternoon. She said counselors will be available for students and staff to talk to at school Monday.

The shooting happened at 10:24 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 20, when, police say, Jason Brian Dalton, 45, of Cooper Township, approached a Chevrolet Cruze and an Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan in the parking lot of Cracker Barrel, 5581 Cracker Barrel Blvd., in Texas Township. Dalton allegedly shot all four occupants of the Chevrolet Cruze, and the driver of the Oldsmobile, who was the single occupant of the van. The victims in the Chevrolet Cruze are: Mary Jo Nye, 60, of Battle Creek, the driver; Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, of Battle Creek, the rear driver-side passenger; and Barbara Hawthorne, 68, of Battle Creek, the rear, passenger-side passenger. The driver of the minivan, Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, Mich., also was killed.

At approximately 5:42 p.m. on Saturday, the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office was called to the Meadows Townhomes on G Avenue near Comstock for a woman who had been shot multiple times in the parking lot. The woman remained in serious condition at Borgess Medical Center Sunday morning. The Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department is leading the investigation into that shooting. The second shooting was reported at approximately 10:08 p.m. at the Seelye Ford Kia Dealership on Stadium Drive in Kalamazoo.

341,https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2016/02/mass_shooting_suspect_did_not.html#incart_big-photo," Gallery: Several people dead in multiple Kalamazoo County shootings KALAMAZOO, MI - The man accused of killing six people at random during a shooting spree in Kalamazoo did not have a license to carry a concealed weapon, authorities said. Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Pali Matyas said he confirmed Tuesday Jason B. Dalton, 45, is not a concealed pistol license holder. That confirmation answers one of several questions that have surrounded Dalton since he was arrested Sunday morning in connection with a shooting rampage Saturday that left six people dead and two others, including a 14-year-old girl, seriously injured. For example, Matyas said he doesn't know how many guns Dalton had registered to him at his Cooper Township home and investigators have not said when Dalton purchased the alleged murder weapon - a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun - or whether the gun was properly registered and owned legally. ""As part of their investigation, the police will be looking at whether he legally owned the firearm that was seized ... as well as any other firearms that may have been seized during the course of this investigation,"" Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said. ""... In addition to the gun that was seized, there were other items of evidentiary value seized from his person and the car."" Dalton, who is being held without bond in the Kalamazoo County Jail, appeared via video in district court Monday, where he was arraigned on six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight counts of felony firearm use. Detectives who obtained an arrest warrant for Dalton prior to his arraignment said Dalton admitted to fatally shooting a father and son from Mattawan at 10:08 p.m. in the parking lot of Seelye Automotive on Stadium Drive. He also admitted to being at the scene of a shooting at 10:24 p.m. at a Cracker Barrel restaurant a few miles from there, where four women were killed and a 14-year-old girl was critically injured. Additionally, detectives said Tiana Carruthers, who was shot multiple times outside The Meadows townhomes on East G Avenue in Richland Township at 5:42 p.m. Saturday, later identified Dalton in a police lineup as the man who shot her. The detectives' testimony Monday shed no light on why Dalton, who did not have a criminal history, allegedly went on the shooting rampage and Dalton provided no clues when he was in court. Getting also said Monday that investigators do not know Dalton's motive. After the shooting in Richland Township, the next round of gunfire came after 10 p.m. when police say Dalton shot and killed 17-year-old Tyler Smith, of Mattawan, and Tyler's father, Rich Smith, 53. A little more than 15 minutes later, police say, Dalton shot and killed Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, and Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74; Barbara Hawthorne, 68, and Mary Jo Nye, 60 in the Cracker Barrel parking lot. Abigail Kopf, 14, was also wounded in the shooting at the Cracker Barrel. She was listed in critical condition at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo following the shooting. On Monday, Abigail's parents, Gene and Vicki, said their daughter is ""fighting for her life."" Rex Hall Jr. is a reporter for MLive.com. You can reach him at rhall2@mlive.com. Follow him on Twitter.

To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. View on Facebook Here’s the right way to start the week: watch this inspiring video of a special White House visit. Virginia McLaurin, a 106-year-old black woman, had dreamed of meeting President Barack Obama. More than a year ago, she recorded a YouTube video expressing her wishes to visit the White House while the nation’s first black president inhabited it. Her wish was recently granted: the White House on Sunday night released a video of McLaurin dancing into a reception room to meet with Obamas, and her joy and pride is infectious. She was invited as part of the White House’s Black History Month celebrations. When the president asked McLaurin if she would like to meet Michelle Obama, the centenarian began dancing over to greet the First Lady. The president, at first, appeared almost concerned about her excitement, suggesting she “slow down now.” “I want to be like you when I grow up,” the First Lady told McLaurin, who said that it was an “honor” to be invited. According to a Facebook page set up in her honor, McLaurin was born in 1909 in South Carolina, and moved to the nation’s capitol in 1941. “I didn’t think I’d ever live to see a colored president,” McLaurin said in the video she posted in 2014. “I am so happy. I pray for you every day of my life.” By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.  More from Vanity Fair Contact © 2021 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

On Monday, a federal judge in New York ruled against the U.S. government in a case that would have compelled Apple to help bypass a locked iPhone’s passcode security. The ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein is part of a case against Jun Feng, who pleaded guilty to drug charges last year. When searching Feng’s house, law enforcement found an iPhone 5S, to which Feng claimed to not remember the passcode. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration then asked the F.B.I. to figure out how to unlock the phone. The F.B.I. tried to use the All Writs Act to force Apple to unlock Feng’s iPhone last year, but Apple refused to comply. ""We’re being forced to become an agent of law enforcement,"" an Apple lawyer said in court at the time. Judge Orenstein, siding with Apple, said in his 50-page ruling that the law does not “justif[y] imposing on Apple the obligation to assist the government’s investigation against its will.” The All Writs Act, a 200-year-old law, is used as justification for many government requests to get data from tech companies. It’s the same law the F.B.I. is currently attempting to use to compel Apple to help unlock an iPhone connected to last year’s San Bernardino terrorist attack. Apple’s battle against the F.B.I. in the San Bernardino case is similar, in some respects, to the Jun Feng case. A federal judge issued Apple a court order that would let the government access the data on an iPhone 5C used by one of the killers in the recent San Bernardino mass shooting. Apple C.E.O. Tim Cook then published an open letter in response to the federal court order, in which he said Apple wouldn’t cooperate; doing so would set a legal precedent giving the government access to encrypted Apple data, he argued. The battle rages on, with tech big shots like Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg, Google C.E.O. Sundar Pichai, and Bill Gates jumping into the fray. Some family members of victims and survivors of the San Bernardino shooting have come out in support of Apple, too. F.B.I. director James Comey and Bruce Sewell, Apple’s senior vice president and general counsel, will testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday, discussing matters like encryption, national security, and privacy. Apple feels it should not have to unlock any one of its devices, because it would go against its customers’ expectations of privacy; the F.B.I. argues that unlocking one device is an isolated incident related to national security. The New York ruling is not binding and will almost certainly be appealed, but it is a victory for Apple that’s expected to have implications if the San Bernardino case eventually makes its way to the Supreme Court. It’s the first decision that directly addresses these issues between Apple and the U.S. government, and, “What today’s ruling proves is that Apple’s objections to the order aren’t frivolous and indeed might well be meritorious,” said Steven Vladeck, a professor at American University’s Washington College of the Law. A senior Apple executive, speaking anonymously, told reporters on a call Monday that the Jun Feng case is similar to the pending San Bernardino case. As such, this executive said, the New York ruling will likely have a “persuasive effect” moving forward, setting a legal precedent that will have implications if and when the San Bernardino case reaches the Supreme Court. Apple will likely cite the district court’s ruling in its petition to the Supreme Court, and during its argument. By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

344,http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/02/goldie-hawn-amy-schumer,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories By Katey Rich Goldie Hawn, an Oscar-winning actress and comedy icon, has not starred in a movie since 2002, in the sadly forgettable The Banger Sisters. This is clearly a grave injustice that can only be fixed by one person: Amy Schumer. The Trainwreck star and unstoppable comedy force has reportedly recruited Hawn to play her mother in an upcoming action comedy, to be directed by The Night Before’s Jonathan Levine. Hawn is in “early talks” for the role, according to The Hollywood Reporter, which had been rumored for Frances McDormand and Sally Field at various points, and is very central to the film. The story, originally scripted by The Heat’s Katie Dippold and recently re-written by Schumer and her sister Kim Caramele—follows a mother and daughter caught up in a crime during a vacation gone wrong. As two very famous blonde comedians born about 30 years apart, Schumer and Hawn make an instant “oh, of course” mother-daughter team. But Schumer’s frank “trainwreck” comedic personality could be a fascinating contrast with Hawn’s famously flighty style—it’s impossible to imagine Schumer, say, as a stuffy heiress a la Overboard, which makes us all the more fascinated to see her and Hawn share the screen. But more importantly—Goldie Hawn is coming back! We’d probably be happy even if it was just a one-line cameo in, say, Wes Anderson’s next star-studded romp, but the idea of a full-fledged lead role is even better. While we wait for Schumer and another famous blonde to bring us their collaboration, this is the best possible way to pass that time.

2.3.2016 12:08 PM Did police avert a mass shooting in the picturesque mountain town of Whitefish, Montana when they apprehended a young man following a string of disturbing social media posts? A handful of citizens and activists believe so. ""We do a lot of hand-wringing and praying and calling for action after school shootings. Here's a case where, potentially, a school shooting was averted,"" says Francine Roston, one of two rabbis living in Montana's Flathead Valley. Roston believes she was a potential target of David Lenio, a 29-year-old short-order cook who moved to the area so he could snowboard the slopes. He often camped out in his van and, apparently, liked to use Twitter. It all began on February 15, 2015, when publicist and political activist Jon Hutson began tweeting in the wake of mass shootings at a Copenhagen cafe and synagogue. Hutson noticed a series of anti-Semitic and conspiratorial tweets directed at him from a user named Psychic Dog Talk Radio. It was Lenio's account, and once Hutson dug deeper, he found that Lenio had spent the previous few days tweeting about killing Jews and fantasizing about perpetrating school shootings. ""Best way to counter the harm #jewish #policies is causing [sic] is #ChapelHillShooting styling killing of #jews till they get the hint & leave,"" read one such tweet. In another, Lenio complains about being a ""wage slave"" and says he's ""not even opposed to shooting up a random school like that sandy hoax stunt only realer."" Hutson reported him to the authorities, who apprehended Lenio the next day and charged him with two felony counts: defamation and intimidation. It was the first charge that caught the attention of UCLA law professor and Washington Post blogger Eugene Volokh. ""Speech can't be suppressed because of the ideas it expresses,"" says Volokh. ""No matter how offensive and wrong we might view those ideas to be."" Montana's defamation statute is so broad that it outlaws any speech that subjects individuals or groups, classes, or associations ""to hatred, contempt, ridicule, degradation, or disgrace."" The county argued that by making statements such as ""The holocaust has been proven a lie,"" Lenio defamed all Jewish people. Lenio's public defender challenged the law as overly broad, pointing out that if one can defame a ""group, class, or association"" regardless of size, that almost any statement that a person finds offensive could be deemed illegal. ""It could be people named 'John,' it could be public defense attorneys… Any group, any size,"" says Getty, who also challenged the statute's legality on the basis that it doesn't require the defamation to occur ""with malice."" The judge agreed with Getty's argument and ruled the statute ""overly broad."" After five months awaiting trial in jail, Lenio walked free and now lives with his parents in Michigan while he awaits his trial for the 2nd charge of intimidation, or making threats. Roston believes that the judge made the right choice in protecting Lenio's free speech in her ruling against the defamation statute but believes that the state much convict Lenio for the safety of the community. ""If this speech is not defined as threatening, then we're in danger,"" says Roston, who points out that Lenio had retrieved some guns from a storage locker in the days preceding the tweets. But Getty believes that Lenio's Twitter posts, which just as easily could have washed away into the ocean of online vitriol had Hutson not noticed it, were simply the juvenile rantings of a frustrated young man and points out that they were not directed at a specific target. ""It'd be the equivalent of, back in colonial days, someone yelling on the street corner,"" says Getty. ""And that's the biggest problem with the state's case, that these are not directed at a specific person."" For deeper look at this case and its implications for free speech in the social media age, watch the Reason TV video above, and check out Elizabeth Nolan Brown's previous coverage.

Oh well, there goes whatever miniscule chance he might have had to win the nomination. Bill Clinton was smart enough to tell Sharpscum and his gang to go fuck themselves, and even Obama is smart enough to try and keep most of their meetings secret. Meh. For every moderate/rational vote this costs him he’ll pick up an identity vote. Also, perhaps wisely hedging his bets in the event of a Clinton indictment. Hello. Good morning Rufus. Slut! Rufus, that is. Nightmare scenario #1 is Sanders winning the nomination and beating whichever ass clown the GOP posts on its side. Welcome to USSA. You know Sanders endorsed Jesse Jackson for Prez back in ’88? And that Bernie supporters use that fact as an endorsement for Sanders? The identity politics movement wasn’t as strong in ’92 as it is now, signalling isn’t just a thing, it’s the only thing. Bernie’s on the right side of this. 148) Holy cow, Slate’s feminist blog actually makes a point I agree with. Apparently, the CDC is recommending all women of childbearing age abstain completely from alcohol unless they’re on birth control. To me, this sounds actually insane, if you actually try to consider it as medical advice. One of the things that really bothered me when my wife was pregnant with our two kids was how much license it gave busybodies to go around telling us what we could do. People who would never offer unsolicited advice at other times were all of a sudden coming up to us and telling us all kinds of dumb things, or feeling free to criticize my wife for having a glass of wine or something. (Okay, a lot of these were family members, but still?) Practically every day, some article on Slate complains that conservatives are trying to control women’s bodies, so it’s nice to see they can recognize and call out an actual attempt to do so. The CDC exceeded its mandate a while a ago. I think it happened when they decided that preventing chronic disease was a valid goal. “First they came for the mosquitoes” Ah, but did they recognize there was a larger issue with government control, per se? You’re silly. The most vocal people on child rearing are the ones with no kids. Yes Yeah, since I’ve had kids, I’ve largely given up on the idea that parents actually have much influence on how their kids turn out. Maybe extremely poor parenting will have a negative effect. But basically, I’ve come around to the view that so long as you’re pretty much average, your kids will turn out the same. Trying to over-parent will only cause resentment. Someone’s read ‘The Lonely Crowd’. http://www.amazon.com/The-Lone…..0300088655 Good. I hope you enjoy parenting. Just make sure I never see or hear your children in public, ever, though. You won’t, until the inevitable mass shooting that they’ll blame on their dad’s bad jokes. since I’ve had kids, I’ve largely given up on the idea that parents actually have much influence on how their kids turn out Beginning a parent led me to the opposite conclusion. I don’t believe that parents can help their kids develop into some sort of super-amazing admirable person. I fully believe that parents are capable of turning their kids into horrible assholes. I believe that most parents don’t have much influence on their kids because their kids spend more time in front of a daycare attendant, public school teacher, and their messed up peers than in front of their parents. My only parenting advice is DON’T. So many Florida Men should follow this. Well, if you parents would just do a better job, we wouldn’t have to. But seriously, I’ll tell people what I think if it comes up, But it’s really none of my damn business. I’ve been blaming all of your parents for years in my head. The most vocal people on child rearing are the ones with no kids. Oh HELL No. You think the nazis on Jezz are bad? Try reading some mommy blogs. At some point parents- especially some moms- became absolutely obsessed not just with raising great kids, but also getting the world to raise kids the way THEY raise them. They are vicious. God forbid you let your kid have some high fructose corn syrup, or let them climb a tree free of anti-gravity harness. And God forbid you NOT doing exactly those same things. There are a dozen mommy blogs all cross linked and deep quoting rants about every possible facet of parenting. And it isn’t just commentary- it’s shaming and vilifying of differing viewpoints all the way down. The most insufferable commentators are the ones with one child. They have exactly one data point that worked out for them, and they won’t let you forget it. They’ve never had to mediate between multiple kids in the house and can spend all their time scheduling and shaping their special snowflake to the ends of the earth. And if you don’t validate and celebrate their personal choices to the high heavens, you, sir, are a disgrace to humanity. Except for the One Bad Mother group. They are doing God’s work. Only if you are double counting my vociferous demands to “shut your fucking kid up in this plane/restaurant/movie.” 😉 The only time I have gotten any static was from some teenagers. I’ve seen some 20-something DINKs roll their eyes before, but never had any problem. With the teenagers, I could give a shit. I tolerate so much of their cliquey tomfoolery and terrible driving that they have no place to stand on this earth complaining about people inconveniencing them in public. Paging Nikki the worst. Nikki the worst please pick up the white courtesy phone…….. As opposed to the BLACK DISREGARD PHONE? Racist. When my wife was pregnant we ran into this all the time, even from doctors. The elephant in the room that only a few doctors will acknowledge is that the studies done on fetal alcohol syndrome are structurally flawed. There are issues with the sample population, metrics, all sorts of stuff. Pearl-clutching Puritans stand ready to attack anyone who admits this and who might dare to tell mothers-to-be that alcohol in moderation is fine, and no doctor wants to risk a lawsuit from a boozehound mother who believes moderation means only a case of Natural Light a day, so you mostly hear that no alcohol consumption is safe. The best medical advice we got was that as a rule of thumb anything you do to your body you’re doing to your kid. So, you want a beer? Have a beer. Just don’t get drunk. Right, it is the lawsuits that kill doctoring in this specific case. We don’t know why sometimes some pregnancies turn out bad. But that won’t stop an ambulance chaser from trying to pin it on anything the doctor may have allowed. And the doctor knows that nearly every mom disregards at least one piece of advice throughout the pregnancy and can defend himself by saying, “Hey look, they didn’t do everything I told them!” The breastfeeding Milk alcohol content studies pretty much put the end to the “no safe amount” shit. The placenta is at least as good a filter as the breast tissue. My wife breastfed for awhile, and the funny thing is the best doctor we saw basically told her that the only issue with drinking post-birth for breastfeeding was that alcohol in the bloodstream could potentially make it into breast milk, but that only happens if you’re breastfeeding while hammered and currently guzzling a martini. She said that basically the healthy human liver will process alcohol pretty quickly, and even when there’s excess alcohol in your blood it’s not the same as pouring a shot of Jameson’s down your kid’s throat. Unless you’re a raging alcoholic in the middle of a bender, worst-case scenario is you get your kid buzzed and feel like a horrible parent. Rounding out the top five GOP candidates were Ohio Gov. John Kasich with nearly 16 percent of the vote… NH didn’t like the movie Fargo, either. Kasich in second? Srsly? A nice enough guy, no doubt, but he comes across as an unexceptional and characterless MOR type. IOW, has “VP” written all over him. But Bernie will need a woman/minority running mate, and Hillary may wish to round out her ticket with a racial/ethnic minority. He held over 100 townhalls in NH. If you watched the most recent Republican debate (only one I’ve seen so far, as it was on network), he mentioned that fact about once every 45 seconds. No, didn’t watch. What was it he was mentioning, VP? The townhall thing. Like Bear says below, he was basically all-in on NH, but it seems unlikely he can repeat that anywhere else I think he went all in for NH. There is NO way he could repeat that in several other states coming up. If anyone looks like VP material to me, it’s Rubio. He practically has “Dan Quayle 2.0” tattooed on his forehead. Took the words right out of my mouth. Kasich is a responsible VP choice. I’m sure he’d be a good caretaker if he had to move up to the big chair. Rubio, on the other hand, is a “don’t assassinate me” choice for VP, a la Quayle, Biden, etc. In other words, he’s a shoe-in. Kasich is from Ohio, I’m from Ohio. The difference between us is Kasich keeps going back to Ohio. I apologize for being a dumbass, but it took me a while being from Ohio rather than in Ohio to realize just what a terrible place it is. About all you need to know about Ohio is Ohio is called the “Mother of Presidents” because more Presidents came from Ohio than any other state – and Ohio is actually proud of that distinction rather than being deeply ashamed of it. Yeah, but those were good Preezies before the media ruined the office for us!!!!! I live in Ohio. It’s okay. The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Obama administration’s regulations on emissions from coal-fired power plants. We’ll be flooded by Gaia’s sweat and tears! The Drought is solved! What goes up, must come down Spinning wheel got to go round Good Morning, Fist. While only temporary, this is a hopeful sign. Kasich? KASICH? Who? I know, right? #feelthekasich eww All potential Kasich voters should be forced to read ENB’s article where she wrote about Kasich’s experience watching Fargo, and listening to The Roots. Link for the lazy? Ugh. What are you, a Sanders supporter? The Unbearable Smugness of John Kasich That’s not the right one. Ugh. I blame everyone else. I guess she did not write the pop culture piece. I have been wrong before, like when I sunk all of my money into No Fear. LOL. No way, dude. But thanks for the linky. That was Jesse https://reason.com/blog/2015/08…..pper-years Thank you. Thanks, ENB. Damn. Srsly? So, he’s a Tipper Gore level humorless nanny. Great. Yes. And, as the ENB piece I linked to states, he is a jerk, which in theory I do not have a problem with, but when you are a humorless jerk, you are just awful. Science Finally Explained My Resting Bitch Face to Me RBF is frustrating to live with but finally science has brought some answers. Last year, two behavioral researchers, Jason Rogers and Abbe Macbeth, used a technology called FaceReader to determine whether RBF is actually a thing, or just a delusion in the eye of the beholder. FaceReader scans more than 500 points on the human face and assigns an expression based on eight “basic” emotions: happy, angry, sad, scared, surprised, disgusted, contemptuous, or neutral. To create a baseline, Rogers and Macbeth ran “normal” faces through FaceReader and found that most people’s resting faces register as “neutral.” Then they ran photos and videos of celebrities most often accused of RBF?Kanye, KStew, etc. What the pair found is that these faces registered far higher “contempt” than the normies. That sneering, condescending emotion accounts for around 5.76 percent of the resting expression for those afflicted with RBF. I’d say I have resting bemused face. Or resting meh face. I have resting “Did you really ignore my advice and take the complete opposite course of action and now you’re fucked” face. I display that face at least 6 times a day. I think we can officially start using scare quotes around the word “science” now. Wow. Dennis Prager (one of my favorite socons, has a small libertarian streak) once said: “(Not withstanding hard science and technology, all studies either confirm what common sense already said, or they are wrong.” all studies either confirm what common sense already said, or they are wrong Every study should confirm what I already believe, or it must be wrong. Well, he did say it was a socon. I have resting O face. A 23-year-old Black Lives Matter and anti-hunger activist who was honored at the NAACP Image Awards in Los Angeles last week shot himself in the head on the steps of the Ohio Statehouse Monday. If he didn’t believe in his cause why should police? You got in while I was agonizing over which phrasing was least tasteless. What had you come up with so far? “Should have just called the cops for the same result”? “Black Lives Splatter” “Black Gray Matter” Yep, you went there. Well played BTW Oh my. Brains Laying Motionless Brainless (Literally) Moron (golf clap) You people are giving Nicole a run for her title this AM. *leaves Tonio in charge of narrowed gazes, returns to work* I knew I could depend on someone to come up with something more beyond the pale than I was even expecting. “A 23-year-old Black Lives Matter and anti-hunger activist who was honored at the NAACP Image Awards in Los Angeles last week shot himself in the head on the steps of the Ohio Statehouse Monday.” He was then arrested for impersonating an officer. I have a niece near Columbus who is familiar with the guy’s group and she says he wasn’t the normal “activist” type – he actually went out and did the work himself and got people interested in volunteering for his cause, he didn’t just spend all his time hectoring the government to do something and figuring out a way to get paid to hector the government to do something. (She belongs to an activist church that preaches the lord told “you” to feed the poor and clothe the naked, he didn’t say to go out and bug the crap out of somebody else to do it. The lord helps those who help themselves, not the people who whine about somebody oughta do something. Which is kinda nice.) Just one more black-on-black shooting to add to the pile. They hate that award. Stay away from that award. They give it to typical bastards. I came here based on the “SJW shoots self” tagline, not the more depressing real headline, and so I offer the following: “Well, that’s a start.” And while, generally, I’d love for this to be the new favored protest method for people who describe themselves as advocates of “social justice”, whatever the fuck that is, my mother, who was bipolar, killed herself when I was a toddler. While I can’t understand the mindset of someone who has the wherewithal to post to Facebook, “Hey, sucks, I’m gonna go ahead and kill myself because the ‘demons in my head’ won,” I can understand and absolutely sympathize with the people who get left behind. It’s a mentality I’ve never gotten either. I’ve had depression and panic attacks that have damn near lasted more than a week, but those have always resulted in me being terrified of dying not wanting to die. Some people though, just don’t consider death as such a bad thing though. It’s on the table of options even if they aren’t religious and don’t think there will be anything better (it’s creepy fucked up, and I don’t think I’ll ever understand it). I mean, there were a couple of times in my life where the thought had crossed my mind, but not because of “demons” or whatever. Twice in my life, very briefly, I thought to myself, “Man, I can’t deal with situation X, maybe I should just call it a day.” Obviously I didn’t, but my point is that it was always in response to external stuff, and it was a product of weighing alternatives. And both times my conclusion was a combination of “yeah, but, what if death is worse” and “I’m not gonna give the bastards the pleasure.” I’ve had shit in my head bad enough I’ve thought a lobotomy might be preferable to thinking “what if this doesn’t stop and I get desperate enough to shut my brain up with a bullet?” Drugs are a wonderful thing when your brain doesn’t work quite right, when the chemicals and the electrical signals get a little too messed up. Zoloft and Klonopin in my case. My wife was very sick for years. She could have gotten a transplant and been ok, but by that time she was just tired of being in pain, and couldn’t handle the thought of one more surgery. She didn’t actively kill herself, but she allowed herself to die. I’m still pissed at her. I had a very good friend and an uncle do one round of chemo and say “meh, I’d rather be dead” and go ahead and die. I don’t judge them, but it does make me wonder how godawful bad chemo must be that you’d rather be dead. I’m hoping I never have to find out. Activists of all stripes really need to see non-activist therapists. I’ve noticed way to often people trying to fill in despair holes caused by depression or other major issues in their life with politics. It’s one thing if the person realizes that their sudden interest is just a reaction to emotions they can’t control, but so many don’t seem to understand what is happening to them. But what are your thoughts about yaoi? *sits to listen* Hmmmm, I’ve moved away from Yaoi over time. I really like it as a teen, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve moved more towards western animation and comics. Thus slash is more my territory now. Japanese animation and comics in general have an issue of being very very similar. There are a couple that will stand out (Blood + for example), but their tropes are so ingrained that a lot of their stuff feels like watching the same character in a different situation with a different hairstyle. I realize that western entertainment has similar issues, but we have so much more media that it is easier to find the exceptions. Plus from a comics point of view, we don’t let comic characters die with the authors. In Japan, you will get one popular comic, then anyone that wants to explore that situation (even within the same company) will have to come up with a thinly disguised knock off. In America, we allow multiple authors and artists to work on the same character. This allows us to give the character a history and depth that is hard to replicate without hundreds of different hands touching the same character over seventy years. This really allows fandom to flourish in a way that’s not seen in elsewhere. Because the characters have been around so long you have multiple generations writing fanworks for the same characters. Their histories are also long and winding with multiple different dynamics, which provide a lot more fodder for nearly any type of story you might want to write. Instead of dying off when the new craze hits these fandoms just continue to build upon themselves taking inspiration mostly from the newest work, but thanks to the continued audience, stuff based upon earlier works will also find a warm welcome that encourages it to still be made. So yeah, I’m a Slash fan more than a Yaoi fan nowdays. I would encourage anyone interested in either to look at the stuff made for the comics fandoms. You’re bound to find something you will enjoy, and it’s really common to find works that are bigger than the Lord of the Rings and well written. Sorry for the late response. I’m sick today. I’m spending a lot of time napping. Man should have read his Hoffer. But barring some evidence that the guy was a monster, I’ll just treat it as sad. Hey man … nice shot. Both my son and I had the same thought at the same moment. I’m a bad, bad father 😛 A near textbook case of mental disorder coming to a logical conclusion. The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Obama administration’s regulations on emissions from coal-fired power plants. They’ll wait for a lull in the news cycle to remove the block. Dictators don’t listen to no steenking courts. You really ought to look into the arguments in the case. This may be the signal we’ve been looking for that SCOTUS may be about to go back on the whole “deference” thing. They may be listening to Clarence Thomas, the one I think most forceful on the idea that “deference” is a big bag of shit when it comes to executive branch agencies and the unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats that run them. Somebody needs to be over-seeing them and keeping them in check and it sure as hell ain’t Congress or the President. That’s what the Supremes are supposed to be doing – acting as a check on government over-reach, not just shrugging it off as “not our job to be telling Congress or the President how to do their jobs”. Yes, it is your job, goddammit. You don’t have a problem overturning laws passed by Congress and signed by the President based on their being unconstitutional – both Congress and the President are forbidden from doing unconstitutional acts so where’s the deference that “hey, Congress and the President must not think it’s unconstitutional so who are we to judge?” 600-pound pig escapes from NH farm, tries to go vote An escaped pig weighing over 600 pounds strolled up to the door of a polling location in Pelham, New Hampshire on Tuesday morning, police said. Naw, that’s just Chris Cristie. The pig was running from Chris Christie. We’ve found Chris Christie’s sole vote in NH. You win this round, UCS. And when I say round, I’m really referring to Chris Christie. A UUUUUGE vote for Trump! Porcine Vote for America to be Great Again! It was just Rosie O’ Donnell. This weird fetish for getting everyone voting the past few years had already gone too far. Did they give the pig an “I Voted” sticker? Yep, and they recorded the ballot for Clinton. And this is such an obvious option for second choice of Vote or Die. Who doesn’t love 600 pounds of bacon? Oh, come on, Pigs are not made entirely of bacon, there’s a quarter ton of other tasty goodness in there just waiting to be seared or barbecued or smoked or cured… The Christie jokes are too obvious. It was Lena Dunham urging people to vote for Hillary. +1 for originality Live Free or Fry Pigasus! The FBI has been unable to unlock the phones of the couple responsible for the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, because it’s encrypted?fueling government demands for a “backdoor” into encrypted phones. If only they had a backdoor into those phones the massacre could have been averted! Route all cell traffic through FBI servers listening for select keywords, flagging positives for active surveillance. Hey, if you’re not an evil terrorist you’ve got nothing to hide, right? The “every FBI agent is Jack Bauer” fallacy. The reality The reality Anybody else suspicious of the claim that the FBI has been unable to unlock the phones? Is Anonymous laughing and saying “give us those phones for 5 minutes you dumbasses and we’ll show you how easy they are to unlock”? Not that I don’t completely trust the FBI to not be just making shit up to suit their own purposes, but I’d be a little bit less suspicious if we had an independent authority on hacking verify the un-hackability claim. Supreme Court puts the brakes on the EPA’s Clean Power Plan Tuesday evening, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay, halting implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan pending the resolution of legal challenges to the program in court. The CPP is arguably the Obama administration’s signature environmental initiative, representing the EPA’s most ambitious effort to control greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Five separate stay applications were filed by more than two dozen states and numerous industry groups. Other states, environmental groups and some energy companies opposed the stay. Thank god, it’s nice to know we’ve got a reprieve. fueling government demands for a “backdoor” into encrypted phones. I think the fuel is always there. How Low Can Central Banks Go? JPMorgan Reckons Way, Way Lower In September 2014, when the ECB’s deposit rate was minus 0.2 percent, Draghi was saying “now we are at the lower bound.” As recently as December, Kuroda said “we don’t think we should institute” negative rates. The rethink is global, even in places where rates are still positive. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney conceded in November that his benchmark could fall below the current 0.5 percent if needed, while Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said last week that negative rates were “working more than I can say that I expected in 2012.” Citigroup Inc. economist Willem Buiter says even China could shift below zero next year. The worry had been that probing below zero risked hurting the profitability of lenders, forcing them to pass on the cost to borrowers. Other fears included bank and currency runs, the hoarding of cash or gridlocked money markets. Anything to prevent the liquidation of bad debt. Seriously, this will not end well. It is going to end extremely badly. With negative rates why shouldn’t I open my own bank? After taking a deposit All I have to do is stuff the bills in my mattress and wait. No reserves needed. Hmmmmm. The good news is, it doesn’t look like the Fed has the authority to impose negative interest rates. Negative interest rates are actual, overt capital destruction. It is the equivalent of taking money out of the capital stock of the country and lighting it on fire. How capital destruction is supposed to be good for the economy is a total mystery to me. How capital destruction is supposed to be good for the economy is a total mystery to me. That’s because you’re one of a small percentage of people who knows what capital is. Trump and Sanders are essentially campaigning – and winning – on the idea that destroying capital is good so long as it is the capital of hated people. Unarmed naked black teen, 17, is shot and killed by Austin police after refusing orders and ‘charging’ at a veteran officer David Joseph, 17, was shot and killed by Austin police after ‘refusing orders and charging’ at an officer Police said Officer Geoffrey Freeman, who is also black, fatally shot Joseph Freeman responded to multiple calls about a naked black male chasing another through an apartment complex Monday morning In-car dashboard cameras failed to capture video of the shooting, but audio of the incident was picked up http://www.dailymail.co.uk/new…..icer.html# Obey or die. David ‘Slurp’ French approves of this message. From what I witness at the gym, there are a few too many police officers who are so physically unfit that shooting someone is the only way they can defend themselves. That’s what Tasers and batons are actually supposed to be for. But instead of self-defense, they get used for “compliance”. …Citizens United[sic] was a bad decision because it allows Republicans to criticize her. Hillary will be, like all on the left, a champion of free speech. Free to say anything flattering to the administration? WELL WOULD YOU PREFER REQUIRED TO? Her fingernails are always clean. I’m keeping this compliment in my hip pocket, it may keep me out of the camps one day. Not only “free” to say something flattering, but perhaps even muscled into it by our most muscular of candidates. Byron York: Decisive Trump victory sends GOP establishment reeling What was extraordinary about the gathering was that I talked to a lot of people there, politically active Republicans, and most of them told me they personally didn’t know anyone who supported Trump. Asked about the Trump lead, one very well-connected New Hampshire Republican told me, “I don’t see it. I don’t feel it. I don’t hear it, and I spend part of every day with Republican voters.” Readers of the story came to one of two conclusions. Either New Hampshire Republican leaders were so out of touch that they couldn’t tell something huge was happening right under their noses, or there really weren’t very many Trump voters, and the Trump phenomenon was a mirage that would fade before election day. Now, with Trump’s smashing victory in the New Hampshire primary, we know the answer. There really were a lot of Trump voters out there, and party officials could not, or did not want, to see them. Bah. Trump will win the open primaries with his unregistered rubes, He’ll lose the closed registered-Republican only primaries as long as the rest of the vote isn’t spread among too many others. So this is the right’s Pauline Kael moment? Or he’s bringing the non-establishment Republican voters who are normally disengaged until it comes times to vote against the Democrat. What really gets me is John Kasich doing so well. This is the guy that said if you want to scale back the welfare state, you’re probably going to go to hell. Socialism is apparently ordained by his god. I hear people say he managed the state well. Maybe he did, maybe he didn’t. Be he has a streak of David Brooks’ like communitarianism that I can’t fucking stand. I’m in his state. He brought us shit like that law where you’ll be convicted as a drug runner for having hidden compartments in your car. In any case, I loathe government “managers”. He thinks he’s the indispensable captain of this love boat, he thinks the government is the soul of a society, he believes in the divine right of welfare recipients, he loves unaccountable police and yes, he’s a communitarian bordering on socialist in all but name. Fuck him and his ambitions. Cheap-ass Rams owner Stan Kroenke buys ginormous Texas ranch for $725 million. What a punk. Good on St. Louis for telling this guy to piss off. How is he cheap? Well if he can buy a big-ass ranch he could build a stadium. But if you can get the taxpayer to foot the bill that’s not cheap, it’s savvy. Why do you think he has $725 million to blow on a ranch? Not that LA will completely avoid pitching anything in to his new stadium, but he did turn down St. Louis free money to pay for the LA stadium himself. He’s moving to a facility in LA he’s paying for. No taxpayer funding in the LA project, unless I’m wrong. That ranch is right outside my hometown. I worked there a couple summers. I’m sure they still remember me as the worst tractor driver in the history of the ranch. Dick Morris: Clinton deploys B Team Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign is falling apart. Bernie Sanders soared in New Hampshire and now two polls have him tying her nationally. It’s a disaster. Now she’s called in the B Team ? the cynical, paranoid and wacky twins Sidney Blumenthal and David Brock ? to bail her out. And here comes the elderly, diminished and livid former President Bill Clinton to lead the duo’s frantic attacks on Sanders. The attacks are rooted in nothing more than a list of dirty names they call the Vermont senator every day. Having found little in his record to attack, they have consulted the thesaurus to turn up ugly sounding accusations. Having found little in his record to attack… In all fairness it is rather hard to attack a blank record. ? Dude’s got decades’ worth of votes. Exactly. More like a record they refuse to attack because they want Sanders’ voters. They won’t vote against Hillary in the general, but they could just stay home. She can’t attack Sanders record because she would do more of the same if she had a “mandate” and was able to set aside enough pork for those who have heard her secret speeches. Oh, Nikki, can’t you just let me have my little jests? Sure, thousands of votes, but he’s only had like four sponsored bills pass, right? So his record is one of ineffectual spear-carrier, not leader. I clearly cannot! But yes, you’re right about that. For sure. But that’s eminently attackable. Maybe my math is wrong but if The A-Team couldn’t get it done, how will The B-Team succeed? The b-team has more experience committing felonies and executing blackmail campaigns instead of shooting the scenery and building chop-job vehicles. +1 Mr. T Uh, (delegate) Scoreboard, Dick. Uh, (delegate) Scoreboard, Dick. SO NICE I SAID IT TWICE. In San Francisco, 77 percent of security cameras on BART trains are fake or don’t work. Probably better than the security *personnel*. [golf clap] I bet a fake security camera is probably as effective at deterring crime, and a lot cheaper. Sounds like a good strategy on BART’s part. It probably is as effective as a deterrent. Lots of businesses use fake cameras like that. But (obviously) they are pretty useless for investigation. ^This. How effective will they be now that people know so many of them are fakes? I doubt they are that effective, because stupid criminals on trains are too stupid too pay attention to cameras. Yup. I’m surprised anyone believed otherwise. The upside is that they aren’t watching even the law-abiding citizens. Ramesh Ponnuru: What’s the Anti-Trump Strategy Now? Trump won big: At this writing it looks as though he will have gotten more votes than the next two candidates combined. He also swept nearly every demographic category. He won young and old, men and women, independents and Republicans, first-time voters and returning ones, moderates and people who call themselves “very conservative.” He carried every education group, albeit with a narrow margin among those with advanced college degrees. He won, as well, in that Republicans who don’t want him are not much further along in finding a champion than they were before the Iowa and New Hampshire contests. John Kasich, who took second place in New Hampshire, does not have a national organization and is considered too moderate by many to win. Many anti-Trump Republicans are at least as hostile to Ted Cruz, the third-place finisher. Neither of the next two Republicans, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, have any reason to leave the race now. What’s the Anti-Trump Strategy Now? They’re still in the pants-shitting phase. The anti-Trump strategy for us is voting for Gary Johnson, and resigning ourselves to a Hitlery presidency. Hi, Hiawatha! Haven’t seen you here in a while. You’ve been missed, bro. Thanks Tonio! I’ve missed you guys and Reason.com too. I think I may start visiting the AM/PM links threads more often from now on. ^This^ As worries mount, European banks face sell-off more savage than 2008 Big European bank stocks, mired by a seemingly endless list of investor concerns, are being sold-off more brutally than they were at the start of the financial crisis in 2008. Europe’s lenders have lost nearly a quarter of their value – over $240 billion – since the start of the year, faced with the reality that spiraling macro-economic worries could undo eight years of cost cuts, safer balance sheets and risk averse strategies. Slumping oil prices, soaring technology costs, a slowdown in China – and the global market volatility that has followed – are just a few of many factors making investors jittery about banks. There are also fears that the industry is undercapitalised for bad debt, and that negative interest rates will soon gut net interest margins and force lenders to charge for deposits. It’s estimated that European banks hold a trillion dollars worth of bad debt. 30% of European government bonds are yielding less than zero. This is the under-reported story of the year so far. We are headed for an epic global meltdown. But the bailouts worked, and austerity kills babies…how can this be true?!? Planned PArenthood changed it’s name to ‘Austerity’? They want to be hated by both the Right and the Left. You can only delay the inevitable. So Obam will leave a worse mess than he complained about inheriting ? Who woulda thought that possible? It’s the do nothing Congress that is to blame for this. Or the inevitable result once you stop injecting 90 billion dollars of imaginary liquidity into the money supply. There are also fears that the industry is undercapitalised for bad debt, and that negative interest rates will soon gut net interest margins and force lenders to charge for deposits. In a way a catastrophe could be good in the long run if it means the end of fiat and central banking. Most people, including economists and investors, cannot imagine a system without a banking cartel at the center of it all. So the only means of undoing the giant clusterfuck of Wilson’s making might just be some objective mathematics, that progs will try to skew and distort like they do everything else. “The FBI has been unable to unlock the phones of the couple responsible for the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, because it’s encrypted?fueling government demands for a “backdoor” into encrypted phones.” Why? Surely they have quite enough evidence to charge the two. Hearing the FBI can’t break the crypt is actually something of a relief. I don’t think charging them is much of an issue at this point. I’m very skeptical of this. The NSA has had the capability to break most cellular encryption for several years, and even the newer stuff is already cracked. And I mean using like standard desktop PCs. I agree. Someone who knows more this issue than I do (I think Carl does…answer Carl), is the FBI’s statement they cannot break the encryption plausible? Or, maybe the NSA just doesn’t want to, or won’t share the technology? It might be an issue of jurisdiction or procedure as well. As in, “the NSA doesn’t have jurisdiction for the vast majority of domestic law enforcement actions that the FBI wants this capability for.” I would think that the link to ISIS, tenuous as it may be, would be enough to move this into JTTF territory, which would provide the legal cover to use NSA crypto capabilities, wouldn’t it? I’m not an expert on this stuff, so I don’t know, I’m just going by random stuff I’ve read over the years. I agree with you on this one. Something tells me the FBI is looking to bootstrap this situation to their desire to make it easier for them to go asking the NSA to crack encryption in strictly domestic law enforcement situations as well. Yeah, this smells a lot like, “How do we know they’re not connected to ISIS unless we can decrypt their phones?” Frankly the whole investigation smells a bit off, but I’m a paranoid anti-government nut, so what do I know? And wouldn’t FYTW cover any other assists the FBI might ask for with tech? If it is an iOS or Android device with full disk encryption enabled (default on the former since 8 IIRC and the latter since 5.1 [?] but sometimes disabled by the manufacturer) and it is not powered on, it is plausible. If it is powered on, it is not likely. Thank you. If it is powered on, it is not likely. “Not likely that the FBI cannot get at its contents,” to be clear. This is not true. The newer encryption- especially the encryption added to android and iOS is pretty tough. That said, the NSA has enough computing power to target individual phones (they just can’t slurp and decrypt the billions of devices out there). However the FBI likely doesn’t have access to that equipment. The FBI types like to go on about high tech shit. But I believe (and mind you, I have absolutely NO empirical data to back me up here) is that most investigations that are successful usually revolve around old fashioned shit. High tech encrypted phones, but somebody signed a credit card reciept. Latex gloves with outers for no fingerprints, but the perp bought a fancy piece of jewelry that stands out. Remember box cutters on 9/11? The fact is that I seriously doubt that in most of these cases the criminals (even the sophisticated mafia types or drug cartels) were capable of some John LeCarre level of sneakiness regarding technology. Oh sure, they may hire some serious bad-ass hacker types. But the folks pulling the trigger or setting up the crime are the ones who leave the clues. I think this whole “Clinton is falling apart” is a bit over-blown. Unless they indict her, she has the nomination locked up True, but we get the entertainment of watching her, her slimey clan, twist and rage at a socialist dinosaur. I hope so. Clinton may be dangerous…but sanders and his idiocy (i am going to help you by jacking up taxes and government spending) is even more so. I saw a couple of minutes of Sanders speech last night. It was pure class warfare and envy. That is all it is each and every time. I have not seem do anything other than go on controlled diatribes (where no one can question him). He is a bitter, angry and senile old man. he also strikes me as full of greed along with the obvious envy Has he ever interacted with actual people? It is like he is a robot. The big question is really…when the idiot Republicans loose, which is a very real possibility, of the two who will they do the most to block every damn policy they propose? I’d be far less worried if the Republicans had acted like a real opposition party these last seven years instead of the whining pork gobblers that they have shown themselves to be. Cockroaches don’t die. Once again I had pro-bernie morons at the local paper. This one was ranting about how individual taxes were too high, then ended the rant by calling for people to vote for sanders. I was stunned by the sheer levels of doublethink required for that statement to be rendered. Yea see that is why i think sanders and his ilk are so dangerous. They are extremely vocal, so give the appearance of greater numbers than they actually have. I think enough Americans realize that Sanders will bankrupt us that he won’t win the general. I hope you are right. It amazes me how stupid Sanders and his supporters are. He also comes off as the give me your money cause i know what is best for you. He’s winning the “youth” vote because most youth pay little or no taxes. That’s it. He would get slaughtered in the general, don’t worry about it. Almost his entire platform is boiled down to “I’m gonna make your evil rich uncle pay for all this shit you like and don’t currently have.” I don’t know the northeast and left coast would go for him. Plus i can see some swing states are. The general tends to bring out typical not caring people who want free stuff. And the dems are uncle sugar I don’t know the northeast and left coast would go for him. Plus i can see some swing states are. The general tends to bring out typical not caring people who want free stuff. And the dems are uncle sugar Plus, he has squirrelzzzz!!!!!!! Because they have the support of idiots? To be fair, Idiots are the largest demographic in this country. Yep they clearly don’t think thru any of his proposals….free stuff for me is all they see! That about sums it up. They are waiting for the implosion of the entrepreneurial classes. As an increasingly small number of people have any experience running a business, even a micro business like pet-sitting or lawn-mowing, people are losing touch with economic reality. And the death of that experience dovetails so well with other leftists goals: regulation of every facet of the economy, making parents afraid for their kids to have any time unsupervised by agents of the state, etc. True and a lot of this is directly related to the over licensing and regulation now embedded throughout our “free market” system. It really irks me when these morons lament the horrors of capitalism and the free market while truly believing that accurately describes our current economic system. Yep which is why i worry…he either is really stupid or is engaging in a sinister plot. The funny thing is…his useful idiots will then wonder why all the goods and services they love are gone. I think there are a very small minority who like it like you say….but the useful idiots are useful. I’d love to see a clip of him, after winning some primary somewhere, in front of his supporters jubilantly shouting “Who wants cake?”. They all do, Tejicano, they all want cake. TAXES ARE TOO DAMN HIGH! Now where’s my free lunch and education bitches? Apparently people actually believe that all that socialist crap can be paid for by taxing the rich only. And that excessive taxes will drain production. Money is only worth something if there are goods and services to buy. Why would people want to produce if all their money goes to taxes? Turkey detains 34 people with explosives, suicide vests at Syrian border – media The Turkish military detained 34 people and seized up to 15 kg of explosives and four suicide-bomber vests as they tried to enter Turkey from Syria, Turkish media reported the army as saying on Wednesday. The private Dogan news agency and other media outlets said the group, consisting of four men, 10 women and 20 children, was detained on Tuesday night in the Oguzeli district of southeastern Gaziantep province, across the border from an area controlled by Islamic State militants. We really haven’t heard much lately from Obama and the Democrats about bringing more Syrian “refugees” into America, have we? Ah, but are they *doing* it? Don’t know, but it wouldn’t surprise if they were. Why, no, we haven’t. Wonder what’s up with that? We have no idea if these people were involved with ISIS. Maybe they were pro-democracy Syrian freedom fighters who were merely trying to sneak around the border to kill Assad? Did anyone think of that, huh? close to home: 4 hurt in shootings outside Muskegon Heights High School Authorities are conducting at least two separate investigations following at least two shooting incidents outside Muskegon Heights High School that left at least 4 people injured. Muskegon Heights interim Police Chief Dr. Joseph Thomas told FOX17 they believe the situation started following a fight in Grand Rapids sometime last week. He said authorities received information that individuals involved with the incident last week might try to ‘settle the score’ at a basketball game hosted by Muskegon Heights High School vs. Ottawa Hills on Tuesday evening. Precautionary measures were taken prior to tonight’s basketball game according to Chief Thomas, including having officers from the Michigan State Police and the Muskegon County Sheriff’s Department in the area. Another mass shooting that could have been stopped by banning guns with the shoulder thing that goes up. No, no, no. It is that thingee on the front that holds the knifey-thing. And the fact that kids can get machine guns easier than books, or fresh fruit. Is that fresh fruit GMO? Because if so I have it on very good authority that it is even more dangerous than a gun that is painted black. OMFG, dude, I absolutely love the fact that amongst gun paranoiacs one of the deciding factors of whether or not a rifle is too dangerous to be allowed in general circulation is whether or not it has the capability to be turned into a crappy spear! It’s like taking a broom and duct taping a chef’s knife to the end immediately makes it an assault broom. Hand that broom to Hillary and she instantly transforms into Manfred von Richthofen. Go get her Snoopy! That imagery is absolutely priceless. And the ones that have the rectangle thing that falls out of the gun and has more than 10 brass cylindrical thingys that go boom. COMMON SENSE According to one lefty Congresswoman once that rectangle thingy is out of bullets it is no longer useful so we must ban the sale of those thingys. She said it in a public speech. Her minions jumped up and started whispering in her ear as soon as she said it. To watch the red rush into her face and the look of panic as she realized how stupid she exposed herself to be was priceless.

YELLEN SAYS PACE OF FUTURE RATE HIKES COULD BE SLOWED “The actual path of the (Fed’s key interest rate) will depend on what incoming data tell us about the economic outlook,” Yellen said. “These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices could provide some offset,” she said. Once again — just WTF does Janet Yellen *do*? Bagholder. I suppose. The stuff coaches spew about how they’re planning to win the game has much more substance than Yellen’s crap. She does lack a certain inspirational quality as a leader. I have a pet theory that she won’t last much longer. Just fill the position long enough to try to maneuver some of the toxic leverage out of the system, before they bring in someone sexier on the speeches circuit. As far as I can tell, it involves gutting an animal, offering the carcass as a burnt sacrifice to the gods, and trying to read the future by examining the entrails. Of course, had they been raising rates since the recession ended in 2009, there wouldn’t be an issue. I think yo meant 2003. U.S. to Send More Troops to Aid Afghan Forces Pressed by Taliban The United States Army will deploy hundreds of soldiers to the southern Afghan province of Helmand, where government forces have been pushed to the brink by Taliban militants, a military spokesman said Tuesday. It will be the largest deployment of American troops outside major bases in Afghanistan since the end of the NATO combat mission in 2014. Though the military insists that the soldiers will not take active combat roles, American Special Operations forces have increasingly been drawn into the fighting in Helmand as one important district after another has fallen or been threatened by Taliban insurgents. the military insists that the soldiers will not take active combat roles If they did, they’d be violating the CoC’s orders. I’m surprised at this point the term “soldier” is still being used. hmm… maybe advisers? /Vietnam flashback Yep, my first thought was that this is exactly how our involvement in Vietnam started. I was thinking it was exactly backwards from our involvement in Vietnam. This time we spent 15 years waging a war there and THEN we sent in advisors. Factually correct. But this feels like how the Vietnam war started. Oh, I’m sure more war is coming. War never changes. Well, at least we aren’t actually putting “boots on the ground”. Don’t forget, Afghanistan was the “good war”. So glad Obama ended that war. North Korea executes army chief of staff: South Korean media North Korea has executed its army chief of staff, Ri Yong Gil, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday, which, if true, would be the latest in a series of executions, purges and disappearances under its young leader. The news comes amid heightened tension surrounding isolated North Korea after its Sunday launch of a long-range rocket, which came about a month after it drew international condemnation for conducting its fourth nuclear test. A source familiar with North Korean affairs also told Reuters that Ri had been executed. The source declined to be identified, given the sensitivity of the matter. Ri, who was chief of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) General Staff, was executed this month for corruption and factional conspiracy, Yonhap and other South Korean media reported. executed this month for corruption and factional conspiracy It’s cute that they bother giving a “reason”. Slightly OT, but when did the retards in charge of editing news copy decide that it made sense to put the attribution at the end of the headline instead of at the beginning. For example: South Korean media: North Korea executes army chief of staff versus North Korea executes army chief of staff: South Korean media It makes it look like “South Korean media” is the story. I’m no lexicographer, but I don’t think that’s how the colon is supposed to work. (But I’m very familiar with how my own is supposed to work.) Also, I can’t wait to hear the method of execution method. They’ve already used “pack of angry dogs” and “anti-aircraft gun,” so my bet is on “strapped to ‘satellite’ rocket” like Wile E. Coyote. In San Francisco, 77 percent of security cameras on BART trains are fake or don’t work. As I trudge back to the fondue mines, I wonder if I could just install a fake me there and hang here all day instead? I think I’ve reached the point where I’ll vote for the first name not from New York on the ballot in November. I assume you are considering Hillary to be from New York. Well, so did the majority of voters there as they did elect her to be senator for their state… I lived in western NY at the time and my wife got to meet her when she visited the engine plant she worked at. My wife, an electrical engineer but now management, was the only woman in a sea of dudes. So, she got to show her to the rest room. Even so we still won’t vote for her. She embodies pretty much every aspect of slimy politician one can imagine and yet is still adored by a hard core group of followers. Kind of makes me want to retch. If a candidate used me as his restroom attendent, I’d be disinclined to vote for him, too. 😉 they did elect her to be senator for their state She beat the awful Rick Lazio (after Giuliani dropped out) with a not very impressive 55% of the vote. Yes – I assume Hillary is a New Yorker. And Bernie could never convince me he’s not also a New Yorker. A 23-year-old Black Lives Matter and anti-hunger activist who was honored at the NAACP Image Awards in Los Angeles last week shot himself in the head on the steps of the Ohio Statehouse Monday. #Firstworldproblems Was it the guy who said he’d shoot any racist in the head? Noyce. Frankly, if his own life didn’t even matter to him, I’m not sure why it should matter to me. Yeh, he went all existential on people. #doesitmatter? He wasn’t aiming for the black part. Look at how gun culture is killing black Americans! I’m narrowing the fuck out of my gays, here. What’s your problem with bears? You’re doing it wrong. Likes em tight. Rubio blames the media “What happened is obviously Saturday night the debate went the way it went, and then just the media coverage over the last 72 hours was very negative about it and so forth,” Rubio said Wednesday on “Fox & Friends.” “So the last thing voters heard going into the booth yesterday was, you know, something bad happened Saturday night. And so it made it very difficult for us to get any other message across.” Rubio was excoriated following Saturday’s debate after Chris Christie called the Florida senator out for his “memorized 25-second speech” ? a line Rubio used several times in the debate about how President Barack Obama “knows exactly what he’s doing” and vowed to keep using on the trail despite the harsh criticism. Please. The campaign for NH starts about a week after the mid-terms. I seriously doubt media memes from the final 72 hours had any impact. Someone doesn’t want to be president any more. a line Rubio used several times in the debate Timmaaaaaay! Why Obama wants to spend millions relocating entire U.S. communities Oh, this is too easy. You know who else… Abraham Levitt? GE? The world governments after Ender and co. defeated the aliens? Andrew Jackson? Robert Moses. Brainiac? (Well it was Kandor, but what the hell) Hey, it’ll cost *billions* to relocate California. And now, Obama’s budget request to Congress includes a proposed $ 400 million “to cover the unique circumstances confronting vulnerable Alaskan communities, including relocation expenses for Alaska Native villages threatened by rising seas, coastal erosion, and storm surges.” Uh-huh. This is very close to peak derp by the choco jeebus. As a rural Alaskan villager, I would be pretty enthusiastic. Relocation? What about, I don’t know, somewhere in the middle of… California? Right along the coast, so we can, uh, continue our traditional living. We’ll build our homes on stilts this time. +1 Styrofoam igloo. I’m guessing for the same reason Deblasio wants to spend millions to relocate (or kill) the horse-drawn carriage industry – to reward a donor. Need to clear out room in American Siberia. People can’t move on their own? Jesus. Who drops out of GOP race after NH? I suspect Carson and Fiorina know they are done, but does Christie’s ego let him stay in for one more chance? Bush, too, should stop wasting his supporters’ money. That leaves Kasich, Cruz, Rubio to compete against Trump. I get the impression that Kasich peaked in this primary. He spent all his money and effort in this one spot, leaving him as “who?” in a lot of later states. Kasich will not win any primaries, except maybe Ohio. And that’s a big maybe. He will linger on as long as he can in hopes of a veep nod. Somewhat OT, but not really: I hate the schedule of primaries. It makes me feel so left out. Michigan’s voting date is post- Super Tuesday, so usually the race has narrowed so far by that point, that it doesn’t matter for whom I vote. http://www.uspresidentialelect…..-calendar/ Don’t sweat it. Our lovely state will reliably vote D in the fall… ‘xactly I’ve decided to not vote this year… though I do get to pull the lever for Amash. Hmm… Jealous. I haven’t voted in a few years. Although I was tempting to vote for the fundie who was banging the congress lady from the west side and tried to come up with a gay sex coverup. Fun. I think she’s still on the ballot or something scandalous like that. I know. Except for those misfit counties in the West side of the state. This is one year in which the races are likely to have some ups and downs, so later may be better. The primary system is totally idiotic. Why can’t they just have a national primary day in say April and be done with it? Why the hell does Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina effectively get to decide whom the rest of the country can choose to be President? This. Though it appears that the country cares less and less what these states do. If you’re going to have a staggered schedule like this, the order should at least rotate and not be the same every damn time. It’s crazy. JEB!, in particular, needs to drop. That would be the best thing for the remaining non-Trump, non-Cruz candidates. I think Christie is done at this point, too. I can’t think of a decent fat joke right now, so feel free to substitute your own. Christie always comes back for thirds? Half marathon update: Last night I hit the fundraising minimum with my already collected donations. I also hit the point that my company matching will cover up to my stretch goal. Thanks again to all the Reasonoids who donated! Training is almost complete. I’ve got one long (12 mile) run left this weekend, then it’s a short taper run the following week. I’m not sure when I started thinking of 7 miles as “short”. The tendinitis I had seems to be resolved, though I’m going to wait until after the race to test if it will still be okay without tape, inserts, and foam rolling. Race day is just over 2 weeks away. Oh, the bad thing is that this 12 mile run is at Heartbreak Hill. At least the actual course in New Orleans has a maximum height of 9 feet. Oh man I totally forgot you were doing New Orleans — R&R, right? I kept almost-almost-almost deciding to register for that last-minute because it falls right when it would be convenient in my training but not so much in my other life. Anyway, you’re going to have an amazing time I’m sure. Seems like training has gone well. Try not to get too jittery during the taper! Yeah, it’s the R&R Half. Good luck, Auric. Awesome! Donald Trump loves winning, and he won just about every group in New Hampshire Godzilla Trump, stomping his way across the state. How dominant was Trump? He tied John Kasich for the most support among people who think undocumented immigrants should receive amnesty. Given Trump’s hard-line immigration stances, that’s basically like saying that Donald Trump won voters who identify as not wanting to Make America Great Again. But they asked about that, too. Among voters who think that the next generation will be better off than today, the generation that will live through Trump’s great America, he won 4 in 10 votes. If there is a Libertarian case for Bernie Sanders, an avowed socialist, as Robby Soave claims, is there a Libertarian case for Trump? Remember, Sanders is every bit as committed to closing the borders as Trump. In fact, likely more so. Trump is an opportunist who was never known to be anti-immigration until he figured out it might be a way for him to become President. Sanders in contrast has held the position consistently for his entire public career. The real upshot is the Democrats don’t have a chance in the general. We’re headed full steam into a structural bear market and the Democrats have held the presidency for the last 8 years. It’s going to be too large to spin. I hope so. An avowed socialist/Marxist rises to near front runner status in the Democratic Party and the Beltway Libertarian response seems to be at best “meh” or at worst “hey look how socially liberal he is”. It is quite revealing. We’re going to get a full display of what happens to socialist/corporatist countries in the next 2 years. Europe is going to implode and there isn’t anything they can do to stop it. With any luck, we won’t follow suit. What amazes me is that we are seeing this big support for a socialist right when we are also seeing Europe start to fall apart. We’ve got a great cautionary example to look at, happening right now, and they all seem to be saying “let’s have some of that”. I don’t get it. Useful iditots are useful. Do you think sanders is just stupid or really is sinister? Y..Yes? I think Sanders is really stupid and is suffering the long-term mental consequences of his 1970s activism. The guy was praising Cuba well into the late 1980s, and had the nerve to hang a USSR flag in his office. As much as I want to see him buried 6 feet under in the nomination and general election, I’m very worried he will win both. His history makes me think he is sinister. He would like to see the US like that. I don’t know, I wouldn’t mind seeing a good ol’ fashioned implosion in the US. Break people’s confidence in the institutions of government and it’ll last at least a generation. Both of my grandfathers grew up during the Depression (in Philadelphia and Birmingham, respectively). One kept coffee cans filled with every single nail, screw, nut, or bolt that came near the house, and the other would cut the mold off cheese. Both retired making six figure salaries. With any luck we might see a generation of people who instinctively shun government involvement in their day-to-day lives. The Great Depression gave us the New Deal and cemented the cultural fixation with the government as national problem solver. Why on earth do you think another depression will produce anything good? +1 Crisis and Leviathan Fair point, John. Progressive government is like an ideological tarbaby. If it fixes problems then it’s obviously the best solution; if it doesn’t, you obviously didn’t use enough. TARBABY!!!! YOU RACIST!!!!!!1!!!!!!ELEVENTY!!!!!! Yep agreed with John. the progs will double down on the progressivism What do you suppose it reveals? That they are actually all secret Marxists and the whole libertarian thing is a ruse? I always sort of figure that it goes without saying on a libertarian site that the socialist is just wrong. I’d like to see more articles on how horribly wrong Sanders is on all things economics related. But they seem more interested in the horse race. What do you suppose it reveals? That they are actually all secret Marxists and the whole libertarian thing is a ruse? It reveals how much they let their cultural prejudices cloud their opinions. It is not that they are really Marxists or would support much of anything Sanders would do. The reason why Sanders doesn’t illicit anywhere near the intensity of opposition from them is because Reason considers his supporters to be part of their culture and class and Trump’s supporters to be from an inferior and alien class and culture. Again, a bunch of retarded college students fall in behind the cause of destroying capitalism and Reason takes solace in their social liberal views. A bunch of working class people from the sticks fall in behind about any political cause and reason thinks the dark night of fascism is falling on America. The difference is the Bernie supporters may not be libertarians but at least they are not “one of those people”. I guess I don’t see them as being as flattering to Sanders or his supporters as you do. But I do agree that some more substantial coverage of the awful ideas that he espouses would be nice to see. It would also be nice to see some more analysis of how many people actually buy the socialistic shit and how many are just fed up and desperate for something different. I suspect there might actually be some significant overlap of young people who support Sanders and who supported Ron Paul last time. There were a lot who didn’t seem to really get the principled arguments, but just wanted someone who really seemed different and opposed to the status quo. Yes Zeb. I would also like to hear them call Sanders a racist for supporting closing the border. They fell over themselves to do that to Trump. In Sanders’ well documented views on the subject are completely ignored. The reason why Sanders doesn’t illicit anywhere near the intensity of opposition from them is because Reason considers his supporters to be part of their culture and class and Trump’s supporters to be from an inferior and alien class and culture. I think there’s a lot to this. I think that, out of frustration with the utter inability to actually shrink government and increase economic and legal liberty, they have retreated to a cultural focus. I think that’s how they justify their claim that liberty is increasing, which seems laughable to me, and why the focus so strongly on culture war issues, because there at least they might pick up a few “wins”. Sadly, this places them in the trenches alongside progs and miscellaneous crypto-totalitarians. RC, Those are all good points. I think also it is the divide between Washington journalists and the rest of the country. The conservative Washington media’s response to Trump has been even more over the top and irrational than reason’s. As I say below, if you objectively look at his positions, Trump is exactly the kind of candidate the Republican media has been telling Republicans they need to nominate for 20 years. Trump is left on social issue and rarely mentions them or relies on them for his appeal and he holds very centrist middle class focused economic views. Yet, they are all reaching for their inhalers basically because they are assholes and can’t stand the thought of someone who is not part of the club being elected. The libertarian case for Trump is related to Reason pageviews. The month long pants shitting fest they did over Trump’s rise in the polls stands in stark contrast to their measured response to Bernie’s rise. I don’t think they realize how classist they are. A bunch of college student retards stand up and demand the dismantling of the entire capitalist system and the reason staff thinks, but they support abortion rights and gay marriage too. Meanwhile they have a collective panic attack over Trump, who isn’t even a social conservative. They don’t hate Trump, they hate his supporters. The Cosmo war on the Yokels continues on… “Reason writers aren’t overly focused on culture and anyone who thinks so is a stupid hillbilly” Sanders seems honest about his intentions while Trump doesn’t? The only possible libertarian case for either of them would have to be entirely pragmatic as they are both utterly unlibertarian. The only case I can make for either of them right now is that at least it’s sort of entertaining to watch the parties fall apart like this. I get the pragmatic issues. My point is that if there is a pragmatic lesser of two evils case for one, then you have to think there is a pragmatic case for the other. Moreover, if you are going to panic over the rise of Trump, I would think you would really panic over the rise of Sanders, who is by any objective measure even worse. Yet, that doesn’t seem to be reason’s view. I’m not going to panic over any of it. But I would say that I do find Sanders’s popularity particularly troubling. In the areas where presidents have something approaching unilateral control, e.g., foreign policy, Sanders is “good.” His bad policy issues won’t get off the ground, especially if Republicans retain control of Congress. That’s a much more reasonable libertarian case for Sanders than there is for Trump. I have yet to read a single article at Reason accusing Trump of being a war monger. The objections to Trump are that is he anti-immigration and a lover of big government and corporatism. Sanders is just as bad on immigration and a hundred times worse on the other stuff. They didn’t panic over Trump because of his foreign policy positions. So that excuse doesn’t wash. Yeah, I could see that being the least bad option. Maybe. Especially if he doesn’t get reelected. The part that really bugs me is how many people believe the shit he says and how hard it is to disabuse people of those ideas. His bad policy issues won’t get off the ground, especially if Republicans retain control of Congress. The same argument could be made for some of Trump’s ideas, too. Deporting illegals, forcing Mexico to build a wall, etc. That isn’t going to happen. Right. But Congress can’t stop Trump from waterboarding terrorists and having their families assassinated. Yes Crusty, And don’t forget, Sanders wants to close the border as well. People seem to have forgotten that Sanders is also anti-immigration and has been for years. Who has forgotten that? It only makes Sanders and Trump equally bad, in that dimension. And Sanders doesn’t call people pussies for not torturing, so he’s kind of winning there. Who has forgotten that? It only makes Sanders and Trump equally bad, in that dimension. And Sanders doesn’t call people pussies for not torturing, so he’s kind of winning there. Yeah he just wants to dismantle the capitalist system. I am sure that won’t get out of hand or he won’t resort to God knows what extreme measures to punish the wreckers and saboteurs once his idiotic policies end in disaster. It is not like that hasn’t happened every single time socialists have gained power. But he might not close GUITMO or waterboard someone. Yeah, Nikki, that makes it all better. Yeah he just wants to dismantle the capitalist system. I am sure that won’t get out of hand or he won’t resort to God knows what extreme measures to punish the wreckers and saboteurs once his idiotic policies end in disaster. And what, exactly, would you say Trump wants to do, to help support every fucking jackass without a job who wants to start manufacturing iPhones in the US? And what, exactly, would you say Trump wants to do, to help support every fucking jackass without a job who wants to start manufacturing iPhones in the US? Put a bunch of center left economic policies through Congress that would not be good but have nothing like the effect of going full socialist. Trump isn’t a socialist. I know it makes you feel good to think him and Bernie are the same but they are not. And you just look like a nut for saying so. I get it that you hate Trump’s supporters and want them to die off. But you should stop letting that hatred cloud your view of reality. Right. But Congress can’t stop Trump from waterboarding terrorists and having their families assassinated. Obama promised not to do any of that stuff in 2008. How did that work out Nikki? Let me remind you Bernie Sanders is a Marxist. If he stopped doing that stuff, he would be the first Marxist in history who respected anyone’s rights after being elected. Maybe Bernie is different kind of Marxist, and maybe I start farting rainbows too but I doubt it. Do you actually think someone who claims to be a socialist will have any respect for civil rights once they are in office? Do you kid yourself that much. I don’t expect you to support Trump but you have lost your mind if you don’t think Bernie is a thousand times worse. Trump is also a socialist. If I have the choice between a socialist who actively talks shit about people who don’t like torture, and a socialist who doesn’t ever seem to want to torture, why would I think the latter was a thousand times worse? Trump is also a socialist. Only if you define the word so broadly as to make it meaningless. Trump is not a libertarian but he is not a socialist in anything approaching the same way Sanders is. Sanders is a Marxist who honestly believes people having more than two choices in deodorant is wasteful and exploitative. This debate is not about Trump. It is about you and a lot of other people having your heads so far up your ass and being so fucking terrified of not fitting in that you think someone with views nearly identical to Dick Gephart is the same thing as an actual Marxist. Yeah, I’m worried more about fitting in than about how disgusting it is to hear the words that come out of Trump’s mouth. What people like you don’t seem to get is that there are some people just don’t like people who act like Trump. It’s not political correctness: we actually don’t like people who act like dicks. What people like you don’t seem to get is that there are some people just don’t like people who act like Trump. It’s not political correctness: we actually don’t like people who act like dicks. So we now judge people based on some arbitrary standard of civility rather than by their actual views? You know what is acting like a dick? Saying that socialism is the answer and that capitalism is the root of all our evils. That is being a bigger dick than anything Donald Trump has ever said. If a socialist doesn’t offend you Nikki, you need to seriously reconsider your views about things. There is nothing more offensive than the idea that free enterprise should be a crime, and that is exactly what Bernie says every single day. Bernie is one of the biggest dicks ever to be in public life. “What people like you don’t seem to get is that there are some people just don’t like people who act like Trump” It’s all about the feels, John. Sanders is enough of a true believer that he could very well attempt to cut Congress out of decisions altogether and rule by fiat. Woo hoo, civil war! Trump won in New Hampshire because it is an open primary and Trump has massive appeal with moderates and independents who are not registered Republicans. Basically, Trump is what the GOP establishment claimed McCain and Romney were; a moderate who eschews social issues and appeals to the mushy middle and middle class. Yet, the nerds over at National Review and the Weekly Standard, all of whom happily shilled for McCain and Romney are all reaching for the asthma inhalers over the thought that someone who is not a real conservative might get the nomination. Its almost like they care more about people who are part of the Washington Club getting nominated than they do about the nominee being an actual conservative. Correction: There are more moderates and independents who will show up to open primaries to vote for Trump because they’re strong Trump supporters, but there are also far more independents and moderates who utterly despise Donald Trump and will vote for anyone before they’d vote for Trump. Trump will actually damage the Republicans with non-Republicans. He’ll get people who wouldn’t otherwise have voted Republican to come out, but there will be even more fence sitters who run screaming in the other direction and vote for anyone but Trump. That’s why the ‘nerds over at National Review’ are accurately noticing that Donald Trump will do serious damage to the Republican party and can’t possibly win a general election. Trump also has all sorts of ideas opposed to the positions of the Weekly Standard and National Review. It’s ridiculous to argue they should support Trump rather than support the positions their magazines actually hold. Attacking Trump is a principled stand by National Review since many of his positions are in stark contrast to NRs. I hear what you are saying Irish, but the polls don’t show that. I am not saying that to debate the merits of Trump. I am saying that as a statement of fact. Does Trump have high negatives? Sure. But so does or will every other Republican after the media is done with them. The fact is Trump has attracted a ton of people who normally don’t vote or don’t vote Republican. Every poll I have seen shows him getting 25% of the black vote in a match up against Hillary. Trump hurts the Republican party’s image with two groups; people who already hate Republicans and the beltway douche bag vote. Everyone else either likes him or is ambivalent. Trump has the highest unfavorable rating of any candidate from either party. He’s going to lose the general. It will be a total wipe-out with Trump vs. Clinton or Trump vs. Biden. Trump vs. Sanders could be more unpredictable, but if it comes to that, you might as well kiss the next 8 year of the Republic goodbye. Trump and Clinton have nearly identical negative numbers. It is hardly clear Hillary can beat anyone at this point. A Trump/Clinton election would be interesting in that a whole lot of votes would be based entirely on who is more hated. a whole lot of votes would be based entirely on who is more hated. I think that’s the norm. Nah. The norm is only mostly based on who is hated more. Trump vs. Sanders could be more unpredictable, but if it comes to that, you might as well kiss the next 8 year of the Republic goodbye. Kiss what’s left of the Republic goodbye forever, because following 8 years of Obama with that would push it past any possible point of no return. I disagree WTF. Winning solves all. Most voters don’t give a shit and would be fine with Trump winning. The only people having a fit are the douche bags in the Republican media. And those ass clowns love power too much not to fall in line and learn to love a Trump Presidency. I was going to actually say that, but thought it was really pessimistic, so I qualified that by saying the next 8 years. I really hope it’s not yet another undoable lurch towards tyranny. Btw, my reply was to WTF’s comment on kissing the Republic goodbye forever. Given Trump and Sanders’ dominant performances, why the fuck did the Free State Project pick New Hampshire again? They seem a bit hostile to libertarianism. No according to Robby Soave. It is a bit curious they picked a Northeastern state instead of somewhere like Wyoming Alaska where people might have been receptive to their ideas. They were hoping to influence the nomination of the President because of NH insistence on being the first actual primary. Really? I don’t think they thought that through very well. I don’t either. A western low population state would have been better. Yeah, forcing your way en masse to share space with a bunch of cantankerous people seems like a strange plan. I think they picked New Hampshire because the Free State Project was comprised largely of urban libertarian hipsters who wanted to live somewhere kind of cool, rather than in Butte or Anchorage. They picked it for cultural reasons and ease of living, rather than their stated goal of actually impacting state politics. In fairness, they have gotten several free staters elected already, I just think they would have been much more effective in Nebraska than in New Hampshire. Apparently they picked only states with populations under 1.5 million, which ruled out Nebraska because it’s 1.8 million, but New Hampshire strikes me as being a mistake. Me too especially when you remember that the majority of the population in New Hampshire are in the Southern end of the state and are just relocated Massholes. Manchester is just a bedroom community of Boston. I believe that part of the calculus was proximity to large urban areas with tech, professional and managerial jobs. Boston far better than Billings, Lincoln or Cheyenne (and I had to look at a map for that one because I couldn’t remember the name of any cities in WY). And the demographics of libertarianism are what they are. The movement would be different if it were composed largely of ranchers. The movement would be different if it were composed largely of ranchers. Yeah, it might actually accomplish something. Might have occupied a Federal souvenir shop. Also NH has a large statehouse – easier to win offices there. The way politics works in NH was a huge reason for picking it. The place is truly unique in that. I think the anti-Trump vote is too divided. If some of the laggards dropped out, there may have been a semblance of pro-freedom voting on the GOP side. “I think the anti-Trump vote is too divided. If some of the laggards dropped out, there may have been a semblance of pro-freedom voting on the GOP side.” Not ‘pro-freedom,’ but I think there would have been an establishment win if there weren’t so many establishment candidates. Kasich, Bush, and Rubio combined for huge numbers, they just split the establishment vote. Just a general question to you and other Reasonoids. If you were to pick one GOP candidate as nominee (besides Rand Paul), who would it be? Ugh. At this point I have no idea. Rubio is a mouthpiece without an idea in his pretty head, most of the rest of them are establishment goons. I would have said Cruz, but he’s basically ejected all of his semi-libertarian ideas at this point, even on issues like sentencing reform that he previously supported. I’m leaning Cruz myself, but I will wait until I finish reading his Amicus Brief in the DC vs. Heller case. The guy is definitely brilliant, and the question is, how much of his pandering to SoCons and authoritarians is just pandering vs. actual belief. And if it is actual belief, how much damage can he actually do? He claims to want a limited executive, but Obama did that as well in 2008, and we know how that movie turned out. Nobody who is actually running. I have been wavering a bit, but basically I am going all in for Cruz at this point, unless i hear or see something else VERY significant from him. If Rubio got the nom, I may vote for him in the general, but I don’t know. If it is Trump vs. Hilary, I may even pull the lever for Trump. But if it is Trump vs. Bern, I will prob go Gay Jay or just stay at home and get drunk. I’d go either Cruz or maybe Fiorina. I still think Fiorina should be the VP – I think she’s an excellent campaigner. I’m a little mystified by why she didn’t get more traction. I’m a little mystified by why she didn’t get more traction. Me too. She was far more appealing than 4 or 5 that are still at the big boy’s table. ” Fiorina should be the VP” Attack dog face. amirite? What are my criteria? Electability, or who do I personally think is the least bad in terms of libertarian values? I’m not entirely convinced that Trump couldn’t win a general, but depending on who gets the Dem nod I actually think Kasich could do well in the general as a middle-of-the-road “moderate” Republican. Seriously, if the Dems nominate Bernie, all of a sudden Kasich becomes the reasonable, adult vote to Bernie’s wild-eyed radical vote. Personally, I’m not wild about any of them, but I think Cruz could be the least-worst option. And frankly it comes down to issues that impact me directly (e.g. gun control) and his making very libertarian-esque noises about economic policy. I personally don’t care that he’s a socon; sociocultural issues are easily comprehended by most people and therefore difficult to force through law, whereas most people don’t know or care about economic policy, which makes it much easier for the political class to manipulate. Who is the pro-freedom GOP candidate? H-h-hitler? G-g-godwin! I admit, I am impressed with his campaign. Now that Rand is gone, I think Cruz is the best bet. I’m still going to vote for Gay Jay regardless, but I will root for Cruz if he is the nominee. The thought of another 4 anti-Second Amendment justices appointed by a Democrat is straight up scary. I didn’t vote for NH because I realized pretty quickly after I moved to NH that the combination of the underlying culture being Puritan and lots of folks from Massachusetts moving to the state would not be conducive to the Free State Proiject’s goals. Besides, with that much snow the roadz will already be shitty enough before we subtract government plows from the mix. They seem a bit hostile to libertarianism. I’m not sure why party primaries are indicative of this. The majority everywhere is hostile to libertarianism. Where were the libertarian options? It’s worth reminding people that when there was a libertarian option in 2012, he did quite well. As much as I like to defend NH, Wyoming probably would have been a better choice. But NH is probably the easiest place to get elected to the state legislature. I don’t think anyone ever claimed that NH is very libertarian. Just that it’s not too far gone, and a good place for libertarians to get an electoral foothold. The majority everywhere is hostile to libertarianism. ^This. They’re just not that into us. While one of our issues may occasionally resonate with the greater populace, the thought of actual freedom is too scary. Society is roughly divided into socons and free-stuffers. I was recently castigated online for being a “rugged individualist” A former federal judge is asking President Obama to pardon a man he sent to prison for 55 years after making three marijuana sales to a police informant. He received five years for the gun in the car; 25 years for the second gun charge, having one in an ankle strap; and another 25 years for a third firearms charge, the gun police found in his home. He got one day for the marijuana. In 2004, when Cassell sentenced Angelos, he wrote a lengthy opinion, comparing Angelos’s sentence (738 months) with the guideline sentences for the kingpin of three major drug trafficking rings that caused three deaths (465 months), a three-time aircraft hijacker (405 months), a second-degree murderer of three victims (235 months) and the rapist of three 10-year-olds (188 months). Meanwhile his six-year-old is now eighteen and his infant daughter is a teenager. Was that his first offense? The evil DOJ just stacked the gun charges like that? As if he was somehow more dangerous for having more guns, because I guess he could fire all of them at once or something? It’s the exploding into space afterward that makes him a true threat. +1 true nature’s child The sentence Angelos received as a nonviolent first-time offender fell under a law called 924(c).Federal drug laws require 5- to 30-year mandatory minimum sentences for possessing, brandishing or discharging a gun during a drug-trafficking crime. For each subsequent gun conviction, there is a mandatory sentence of 25 years that must be served consecutively. This is often referred to as “gun stacking,” which is why Angelos received 55 years without parole. Certainly he’s more dangerous than a child rapist. I mean, the rapist left his victims alive. This guy could have murdered his customers. Remember it was the US Attorney who stacked those charges. This guy should be pardoned and the US Attorney who did that should be disbarred and spend the rest of his life doing penance in the hope there isn’t a hell. Just horrible. I wonder whether the Holder memo actually had an affect on charging habits. I haven’t heard anything about it since, what, 2013? I would bet a lot of money it didn’t. DOJ has a long ingrained culture of abuse and arrogance. It is a bipartisan disgrace. No way in hell did that memo have any effect on a culture that rooted in an organization. Sup biotches. Long time no see. How’s everyone doing? Welcome back. Waiting, hoping, praying for a clinton breakdown and/or indictment. How ’bout you? Pretty good, my friend. I quit praying and waiting for a Hillary indictment, given Obama’s comments from a few weeks ago thumbing the scale against Sanders. 🙂 If she does get indicted, I’m putting my money on Biden jumping into the race to save the party from the socialist. Hello Injun. Are you doing your duty to your motherland by scalping Marc Andreessen* on Twitter for saying Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades, by which he definitely meant India should have stayed under British rule? *a douchey venture capitalist** **redundant? Naah. I heard something about it but don’t know enough, so I’m staying out. I generally like Marc, despite his dumb tweet. Heh, didn’t think so. It’s dumb. He was ranting about Facebook’s Free Basics being banned, and made that (ill-advised) tweet. It’s patently obvious that he meant it in the sense that nationalists who oppose benign foreign interests on “anti-colonialist” grounds are bad for the economy, but now has a headline on Bloomberg about his “Pro-Colonialism Tweet”. It’s like Netscape breeds crimethought or something. Concern trolling over body armor Former police officer Brian Murphy was shot 15 times at the Sikh temple massacre in Wisconsin in 2012. Now he works for Michigan-based Armor Express and sells the same brand of bulletproof vest that saved his life. But only to cops. He doesn’t think civilians should have them. He said that criminals who wear bulletproof vests “change the whole dynamic” for cops, who are trained to shoot at the torso, because it’s a large target with vital organs. Cops are civilians, asshole. Sorry, I forgot the warning. Auto-play video. Worse than Hitler Brian Murphy. Interesting that there are two categories in Brian’s mind: cops and criminals. Says a lot, I think. A 23-year-old Black Lives Matter and anti-hunger activist who was honored at the NAACP Image Awards in Los Angeles last week shot himself in the head on the steps of the Ohio Statehouse Monday. He should be held forth as a role model to all BLM activists. Has anyone posted this yet? It’s a great, short read. Read and weep for our country. Glenn Reynolds: Washington’s culture of corruption rots on When bureaucrats are above the law, ordinary Americans may want to follow suit. You didn’t post it either. “A 23-year-old Black Lives Matter and anti-hunger activist who was honored at the NAACP Image Awards in Los Angeles last week shot himself in the head on the steps of the Ohio Statehouse Monday.” We all make the world a better place, some of us because we are in it, the rest when they leave it. See, this wouldn’t have happened if it the guy didn’t have such easy access to guns…. Then we have to make sure more of these people have easy access to guns. Bill Kristol Verified account ?@BillKristol Sticking with my prediction: Trump will win no caucuses or primaries, and will run behind Ron Paul 2012 in IA and NH. 8 Dec 2015 That’s the Kristol Ball right there. Nice. But I suspect he’ll show as much humility as our own ‘Plug did when one of his very public predictions didn’t come to pass. Always remember, journalists as a group are morons. Even the ones who agree with you are likely morons. I think Trump is at his max. Does anyone think many voters have trump as 2nd choice? As the field dwindles, someone will collect the votes. And in states where independents cant vote, he will have less draw. I think Trump is at his max. Does anyone think many voters have trump as 2nd choice? This is what I’ve been saying for a while, too. I doubt there are many people out there who have narrowed their preference down to, say, JEB! or Trump, and it’s not like Kasich or one of the others suffering from lack of exposure. At this point, everyone knows who Trump is and has made up their minds one way or the other, I think. Next contest is SC on Feb 20, an open primary. Washington has an R caucus that day, but they also have a primary later on (weird). Nevada has its closed caucus on 2/23. Super Tuesday is (of course) on March 1. If Clinton isn’t indicted and resigned before then, she’ll stay in the race and most likely capture the nomination. “Super Tuesday is (of course) on March 1. If Clinton isn’t indicted and resigned before then, she’ll stay in the race and most likely capture the nomination.” Are those winner take all primaries? If not, I think the race will stay very close because Benito has significant following almost everywhere. Though the superdelegates are hurting him now. I think it’s entirely possible that many Cruz supporters have Trump as their second choice, though it’s hard to say for certain. A while back I thought Carson would be their most likely second choice, but that clearly isn’t the case any longer. The FBI has been unable to unlock the phones of the couple responsible for the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, Bullshit. They are “failing” only because they want that back door more than they want to get into that phone and track down possible other terrorists. Think “Fast and Furious”, only encryption, not guns. They can’t just come out and admit that the NSA has developed quantum computing. They’d give the whole game away! Yeah. I find it difficult to believe that the people who made the phone or the people who made the encryption software cannot unlock the phone. Remember the case involving the guy who wouldn’t give up the password to his laptop a few years ago? They went to the wall on the legal issue of them being able to force him to give up. Then magically they cracked the encryption. If they used good encryption, the makers of the encryption cant break it. But I doubt its good enough to resist nsa methods. In fairness, the NSA never plays ball with the LEO community. Also, legally they are not supposed to use any of their assets unless there is some kind of foreign connection. If I had to guess, I would say that DOJ is for political reasons unwilling to admit any sort of foreign nexus, because doing so would undercut Obama’s claim that he has all those terrorists on the run. And without a foreign nexus, they can’t get NSA’s help. Obama presents budget to Congress that would $9 to $10 trillion more to the national debt. No big surprise though from perhaps the most fiscally irresponsible man in world history, that’s for damn sure. $400M for relocating Alaskan native tribes due to climate change?

347,http://observer.com/2016/02/apples-battle-is-doomed-to-fail/,"A protestor holds up an iPhone that reads, “No Entry” outside of the the Apple store on 5th Avenue on February 23 in New York City. Protestors gathered to support Apple’s decision to resist the FBI’s pressure to build a ‘backdoor’ to the iPhone of Syed Rizwan, one of the two San Bernardino shooters. (Photo: Bryan Thomas/Getty Images) Apple is leading the charge of the Mighty Eight (Twitter, LinkedIn, AOL, Google, Apple, Yahoo, Facebook and Microsoft), appointing itself guardian of the privacy rights of Americans—be they wholly innocent, undoubtedly guilty or simply grooming youngsters en route to being radicalized. The principled libertarian may well applaud this perceived ethically driven stance by one of the most successful companies on earth and thank capitalism for creating a corporation powerful enough to stand up to a government. The realist might suspect Apple’s protestations of impossibility either cover an ulterior motive or are a petulant reaction to being forced to abide by the house rules like everybody else.
The request for Apple to provide the keys to a box likely containing incriminating evidence should come as no great surprise. An iPhone 5C was used, instrumental to the mass shooting, resulting in 14 deaths. That phone, with a password protection feature that will self destruct on ten incorrect attempts, is thwarting a federal investigation. Apple states it has purposely built a technology so secure that the creator is not able to access its contents. This beggars belief might be construed as frankly irresponsible.
There is a long history of telecommunication companies turning over information to investigating authorities. The irony is that I learned about the technology of telecommunications not in my current incarnation as an intellectual property lawyer, but as a criminal defense barrister for ten years in England. From the end of the 1970s and early 1980s legislation was enacted around the world prohibiting telephone conversations from being illegally intercepted, simultaneously laying the framework for interception warrants by national security or enforcement agencies.
In the early 2000s, the information that the prosecution would disclose was eye opening. Evidence ranged from domestic and international wiretaps through to reams of spreadsheets with azimuths, coordinates and cell-site triangulation maps. In London especially, where one in five of each of the world’s CCTV cameras live, the investigating authorities had enough information to listen to, watch and track a defendant’s every digital move, scuppering a host of potential defenses. At the time, it was infuriating—with each technological advancement, lawyers had to work harder for acquittals. We used to joke that if the discerning criminal moves back to using invisible ink, their endeavors would be much more fruitful.
In the United States, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act has become the bedrock statute with an accepted culture of government agencies forcing telecommunications carriers to give backdoor access, allowing free and liberal wiretaps. In this case, the operative law that the DoJ can utilize to compel Apple to formulate software to crack the phone is the All Writs Act of 1789, which is incredibly broad in both drafting and application. Why however, Apple has chosen the San Bernardino iPhone to make its prime privacy stand is very curious.
It is inconceivable that Apple has has not already written or is unable to write software to bypass the password function or eradicate the pauses required in between attempts. It is much more likely that despite the FBI’s noble cause in this instance, as Apple operates in China, Russia and the Middle East, it is more concerned about being similarly compelled by a foreign government which will seek to access information for more base motives. Of course, there is the old but valid argument that if backdoors are created for the FBI, then it makes it easier for hackers to get in too. This will not hold much weight in this fight.
While Apple may wish to elevate itself above the others in the telecoms industries and use the pretext of user privacy as its shield, this is a battle that is doomed to failure. There are far too many loners that have been radicalized over social media and pedophiles snapping photos of children for Apple to withstand the pressure of law enforcement, judicial will and the tide of political will for much longer.

348,http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/18/confused-about-apple-and-the-fbi-what-you-need-to-know.html," Apple has taken on  a high-profile fight with the FBI that's sparked a spirited  philosophical debate on the sweeping implications to national  security and personal privacy. But what would it really take for  Apple and the FBI to get along? The truth is, it's complicated. Here are the basics to get  you up to speed on both sides of the argument, what's at stake,  and what's still unknown as the deadline looms for Apple to  comply with the courts. The FBI is in the midst of investigating a married couple who  killed 14 people in a mass shooting in San Bernardino,  California, in December. The pair was believed to be inspired by  the terrorist group, the Islamic State or ISIS, but it's unclear  how deeply the pair is tied to foreign militant groups, according to Reuters. Messages on shooter Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone may, or may not,  shed light on their terrorist ties. But the phone is locked by a  pass code, and by default, these phones are programmed to erase  data after too many unsuccessful unlocking attempts. The FBI  didn't want to risk trying to hack the phone and losing all the  data in the process. Read MoreWhy Apple is fighting  the FBI's San Bernardino investigation Up until now, Apple has helped the FBI with the case, the  company said. But it has resisted one specific  request:  To make a new version of the iPhone  operating system and install it on an iPhone to make it easier to  unlock by trying millions of password combinations without  erasing the data within. A federal magistrate  ruled Tuesday that Apple must create this highly specialized  software within a certain time frame. But Apple CEO Tim Cook released a  letter saying he would challenge the FBI's demands.

Walton told reporters that a gunman opened fire about 5 p.m. Thursday at Excel Industries, a manufacturer of lawnmowers in Hesston, Kansas Four people are dead and 14 have been wounded after a mass shooting at a factory in a tiny Kansas city, according to authorities. Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton told reporters that a gunman opened fire about 5 p.m. Thursday at Excel Industries, a manufacturer of lawnmowers in Hesston, Kansas – a city of about 3,700 people, 35 miles northwest of Wichita. Walton said responding officers shot and killed the gunman, according to KWCH-TV. After the shooting, the sheriff told assembled media that four to seven people are dead and an estimated 20 to 30 had been wounded – though investigators are still waiting to enter to factory, KAKE-TV reports. According to NBC, those numbers are now 4 deceased including the gunman, and a total of 14 injured. The shooting began outside the plan when the gunman opened fire on a pickup truck in downtown Hesston, wounding the man inside. Another man was wounded at an intersection nearby. A third victim was wounded in the parking lot of Excel before the shooter entered the building and opened fire, KSN-TV reports. Walton confirmed that the gunman is an employee of Excel. Witnesses told the Wichita Eagle that the shooter appeared to be armed with an assault rifle and a handgun. Witness Jared Trujillo told KAKE that he was working on the assembly line when he heard what he thought was an explosion. A manager told workers that there was a shooter in the building and told them to run. “He was just unloading on everybody,” Trujillo said. One employee was shot in the leg as he tried to escape, Trujillo recounted to KAKE. Trujillo and coworkers stopped and used to a belt to stop the bleeding and tended to him until ambulances arrived. Trujillo embraced his wife Jennifer in a tearful hug as they were reunited. “I’m just glad to see him. He’s my life. I don’t know what I’d do without him,” Jennifer said.

350,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/20/jeb-bush-family-legacy-dynasty-election-2016,"Don’t blame Trump or pity him: Bush bungled his own campaign from the start and may have ended a dynasty of genteel political malfeasance and mass death Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 19.17 GMT In announcing the suspension of his campaign, Jeb Bush couldn’t have found a more apt expression for his departure from a contest that was beyond his ken than “I congratulate my competitors who are remaining on the island”. The 2016 Republican presidential primary is a thing forged in madness; as befitting the functional illogic of a reality TV show, it doesn’t make a lick of damn sense beyond itself, but the results cannot be appealed. Jeb has been voted off the island; he is the weakest link; goodbye. There were signs long ago that he would fail to gain traction among Republican voters despite his political pedigree and all his campaign cash – not necessarily deterministic, but they were there.  The publication of his book Immigration Wars: Forging An American Solution in 2013 is one such sign: even at the time, the book seemed to be a bad idea at best. It hit bookshelves just as the Republican National Committee was putting together a postmortem on the 2012 election that noted – again – that the party needed to appeal to Latino voters. Yet Bush’s book repudiated his own history of being an inclusive conservative politician who championed in-state college tuition for the children of undocumented immigrants, drivers licenses for the undocumented and supported the Dream Act, so long as it wasn’t implemented by Barack Obama’s executive action. The author Bush argued against any path to citizenship for those who entered this country illegally. Bush hadn’t even announced at that point – and Trump hadn’t yet rocketed to front runner status by stoking nativist paranoia – and already he’d tied himself into a knot on what everyone knew would be one of the biggest issues of the 2016 campaign. From then on, no position that Bush advocated could escape the label of flip-flopper because he had flip-flopped on immigration. In the purity test of any Republican primary, Jeb was already the establishment, already dangerously a RINO, but now he was also infinitely changeable on the most important policy issue of the day. He might take a hardline on some issue today, but what about tomorrow? Then came the campaign rollouts: Bush launched The New Bush Experience by gathering around him every establishment neoconservative from either the Reagan or the Bush II years – a soulless sludge of amoral warmongering boobery that, ethically-speaking, resembled the invitees to a North Korean state dinner. (They are the sort of people who put on jackets covered with epaulettes and ribbons from armchair campaigns before mounting their rider mower and treating the lawn like they’re about to daisy-cutter Vietnam.) Bush insisted he was his own man by announcing that he’d listen to advice from the people who belonged to at least one other institutional failure. And any question of Bush hearing their counsel but keeping his own fell flat when he stumbled over multiple answers about whether the Iraq War was a good idea. This was the one question he had to have an answer for – that, indeed, it would be absurd for any American to not have an answer for – and he flubbed it repeatedly for days, before arriving at the self-evident: he would not have invaded. The fourth time was the charm, but it wasn’t charming. When it couldn’t conceivably get any worse, Donald Trump entered the race. Blaming Jeb’s failure on him devalues just how badly Bush could’ve simply screwed his campaign up on his own. Trump was the accelerant, but Bush had to fumble and drop a lit cigarette into his pants cuff before the Trump-branded gasoline could do its work. Trump didn’t make Bush reply to a mass shooting with, “Stuff happens”. He didn’t make Bush, a man married to a Mexican woman and the father of mixed-race children who almost exclusively speaks Spanish in his own home, say that we shouldn’t live in a multicultural society. He didn’t make Bush say that people in this country needed to work longer hours. He didn’t tell Bush that Obama’s daughter’s name was “Malala” (which is the name of the Nobel peace prize winning Taliban shooting victim turned women’s rights activist), not “Malia”. Yes, Trump just did his own thing, and ridiculed Jeb, but if a tree falls in a forest and there’s no one around to call it weak, it still falls down. None of that even gets to all those weird, doomed attempts by Bush’s campaign to make him go viral: pictures of Bush flashing the liners to his blazers, showing his JEB! emblem on a white background. Or the picture of a somewhat pathetic and forlorn Jeb standing in a hoodie, staring at the camera, as if pleading to know when this ends. Or him taking a selfie in front of the “Peachoid”. Or that last, harrowing Twitter picture, of a gun with his name engraved on it; Bush simply tweeted, “America.” So, for as much as surrounding circumstances might have sped up the process, the bumbling began with the campaign itself, and there was nothing Jeb or his advisors could do to stop it. But, perhaps despite the sadness on his face as he took his leave of the race, and despite his wife’s tears, and despite the fact that, by comparison, he is probably a less odious person than many of the men left in the race, there’s no need to feel pity. The Bush dynasty lost this once; given what it’s done for America in the past, that might ultimately be a good thing. The Bush clan is a pack of jackals that has skittered among the tall grass of politics now for four generations. Granddad Prescott was a senator who made his cash at Brown Brothers Harriman, in part by investing in Germany’s financial rebuilding on the road to WWII. George HW Bush worked at Brown Brothers Harriman, too, before becoming an oil wildcatter, then a congressman, the head of the CIA (where he overlooked domestic anti-communist terrorism) and finally president, where he pardoned away the dregs of Iran-Contra and solidified the post-Watergate blueprint for America’s refusal to prosecute its greatest political criminals. You know all about Jeb’s brother, George W “Endless War” Bush. Jeb’s son, George P Bush, once reportedly crashed a car into his ex-girlfriend’s yard after failing to gain entrance via a window (her family opted not to press charges) and is now Texas Land Commissioner – after raising over $3m dollars for the race before he even had a challenger and on the basis of his extensive experience as Bush family member. Maybe Jeb’s failure means his son won’t strive for even higher office. Or maybe not. After four generations of participating in Republican politics and appealing to Republican voters, the conservative base prefers someone who wants to build impossible walls, expel 11 million people, start trade wars with countries we distrust and bomb anything that moves. There is some consolation in seeing a dynasty of genteel political malfeasance and mass death undone by a TV showman who recognizes that the audience now wants the same product, just bigger, louder and cruder. But this is the small justice that people seek when they know the system will forever fail them. There is no glee here, just resignation. Besides, interpreting events like that again focuses on Trump, when the visceral truth of the Bush campaign was that we finally saw the rot of their dynasty move to the surface, like cheap composite plywood puncturing through a deep wood veneer. Jeb Bush was one of the family, and he failed. And if there is one, stark emotional legacy of the Jeb 2016 experience, it is this: despite coming from all that power and money, Jeb Bush ran a campaign so wracked with failure and so thoroughly inept that he could move millions of Americans beyond their richly earned contempt for him and his family. By the end, Jeb Bush actually made people feel sorry for him.",2016-02-20 23:32:09,"Ding, dong, the dynasty is dead: so long to Jeb Bush and the family legacy | Jeb Lund","politics and government,united states politics and government,elections,presidents and presidency (us),presidential elections (us),public opinion,election issues,biographical information",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
351,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/25/gun-company-boss-says-democratic-presidential-win-will-boost-sales,"Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.17 BST The chief executive of gun company Sturm, Ruger & Co expects a big jump in already heightened demand for firearms if a Democrat wins the presidential election in November. Michael Fifer told investors on Thursday the company made $172m profit in 2015 and could expect more in 2016 if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders becomes positioned to appoint future supreme court justices.  Fifer said fear that a Democrat will get to replace the conservative justice Antonin Scalia, who died earlier this month, would send consumers rushing out to buy more guns because of concerns that gun control laws might be tightened. “I think we’ll see a step up in demand if a Democrat wins the election, particularly so if they win the Senate,” Fifer said on a conference call with investors. “Despite whether President Obama is successful in appointing a supreme court justice, it’s more than likely, based on age and health, that the next president will get several opportunities, and that could drive concerns about gun rights.” Gun companies have been benefiting from record profits and sales under Barack Obama, with spikes in sales following every mass shooting incident. Shares in Sturm Ruger, which sells handguns and automatic rifle such as the SR-556 Takedown, have risen by 960% since Obama took office in 2009. The shares rose by 7.8% to $69.21 on Thursday – their highest since February 2014 – five days after six people were killed in a shooting spree in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Smith & Wesson, the gun company that made the assault rifle used in the San Bernardino massacre in December, which left 14 people dead and 22 seriously injured, has seen its shares rise by 970% while Obama has been in the White House. Over the same period, the S&P 500 index of leading US companies’ shares rose by 130%. FBI background checks, which act as a proxy for gun sales, hit a record 23.1m in 2015 – more than two and half times as many as those processed a decade ago. In December alone – the month of the San Bernardino shooting, more than 3.3m requests were processed through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (Nics). The gun rush has led Wall Street analyst Brian Ruttenbur to call Obama, who recently announced a string of executive actions designed to tighten gun sales laws, “the best salesman for firearms”. Jurgen Brauer, an economics professor who specialises in the gun industry, said: “Whenever there is even talk about firearms regulations there is almost immediately an unmistakable increase in sales. “Even talk about such legislation translates into sales jumps. People are buying guns as part of the American dream of freedom and liberty.” In 2013 Fifer, who collects a pay package worth nearly $2m a year, told investors: “If you look back at historical patterns back in late ’08, early ’09, you saw a huge spike in accessory sales, which then tapered off. “And then we saw it again with the really tragic events at Sandy Hook that started again as soon as the politicians started talking about restricting legal gun use.”",2016-02-25 17:04:15,Gun company boss says Democratic presidential win will boost sales,"politics and government,finances,united states politics and government,presidents and presidency (us),firearms",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Also there were multiple murders in Chicago. And that’s just a partial list. Gun murders and woundings, often by individuals with legal guns, ostensibly the NRA’s good guys, have become so common they don’t even break into the news when they happen. To get national airtime in the U.S. a simple massacre murdering 4 or 5 people is not enough.  And I notice that a story on SR about Monsanto may get 7,500 views while one on a gun massacre only gets 250. We seem to have a collective cultural agreement not to talk about an epidemic of death which, if it were cause by a virus, would have people running around with their hair on fire, and the media broadcasting wall to wall coverage — remember Ebola.

Ford shot 17 people in central Kansas on Thursday, killing at least three of his victims. Perhaps Mr. Ford was worried about losing his job and snapped. Perhaps he was angry at a co-worker.

354,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/hesston-kansas-small-town-america-mass-shooting,"Residents have come together in compassion and grief in the absence of heated rhetoric about religion, terrorism and demonizing the gunman Last modified on Wed 20 Sep 2017 17.10 BST Pastor Brad Burkholder is less interested in what the recent massacre in his Kansas town says about the shooter than in what the shooting says about humanity.  “Whenever I hear people ask: ‘Why do bad things happen to good people?’ I ask: ‘Who are the good people?’” Brow furrowed, deep in thought, he stares at the floor of the Hesston Mennonite Brethren church. “Nobody deserved this, but instead of thinking ‘I could never do that’, instead I pray that it’s never me. Because I could get to a place where that could be me.” Unlike the Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado in December, or the attack on a government building in San Bernardino in December, Thursday’s violence in Hesston, Kansas, which took the lives of four and injured 14, lacks a political charge. Kansas’s relatively lax gun laws are relevant, but Cedric Ford was not a legal gun owner and the woman who supplied his guns has been arrested. Ford shot dead Josh Higbee, Renee Benjamin and Brian Sadowsky. He was then shot dead himself. But in the absence of heated rhetoric about religion, terrorism or abortion, the citizens of Hesston have come together in compassion and grief. On Friday night, residents with tears in their eyes and candles in their hands gather at Heritage Park. Dozens of Hustler lawnmowers (which are made at the Excel Industries factory where the shooting took place) are parked on lawns, displaying messages of sorrow and strength. There is very little anger or thirst for retribution, but instead sober discussion about mental illness and the stigma that keeps people from seeking help. “If you admit that you have anger that you can’t control, that’s seen as weakness,” says pastor Burkholder. “Our culture applauds strength and having it together. And weakness is frowned upon.” Instead of framing the shooter as a villain who did an evil deed, Burkholder empathizes with him. Burkholder is not a violent man, but he says he often struggles with other temptations and as a Mennonite Christian, he sees all sin as equal. “As a pastor, I often talk about dealing with depression and anger, because there is help available,” he says. “I’ve dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts as an adult, and before I saw a counselor I held a lot of stereotypes about people going crazy. I wish when I was a kid somebody would’ve told me they were a follower a Christ, and they still struggled with sin.” In this small Kansas town of 3,700, it is difficult to find anyone who will speak ill of the man who shot a semiautomatic rifle at pedestrians from his moving vehicle, before arriving at his place of employment seemingly to execute coworkers at random. At Casey’s general store, across the street from Excel Industries, an employee who asks not to be identified says she was friends with Ford. He was not a monster, she says, but a very kind man who often comforted her in times of distress. With tears in her eyes, she says she looked forward to seeing him and the other workers when their shifts ended. Hesston, a 120-year-old town, is no stranger to tragedy. In 1990, one of the most violent tornadoes in history blasted through, obliterating 226 homes and 21 businesses. Between 1974 and 1991, just north of Hesston in Sedgwick County, Boy Scout leader Dennis Rader (aka “the BTK killer”) murdered 10 people. Until 2005, when he was arrested and imprisoned, he sent letters about his crimes to the media. “I’ve heard a couple people say, ‘Fuck him, I’m glad he’s gone,’” says a Hesston resident, who also asks not to be named and will be referred to here as Martin, of Rader. “And I just don’t see it that way. I see a sick individual that needed serious help. And it breaks my heart to think that he didn’t have anyone that he felt he could go to with that problem, or anyone to tell him he needed help.” Martin’s empathy extends to Ford, who was a casual acquaintance at Excel. “Nobody ever says: ‘This will never happen to me,’ but they never think it will happen to them,” he says, his face twitching with grief. Martin was operating a forklift at Excel on Thursday, when he heard shots fired elsewhere in the building. Without bothering to turn off the machine, he helped usher his coworkers out of a nearby exit, leading them to safety at a trailer park down the road before returning to the scene. Police had arrived; Martin used his sweater as a tourniquet on the leg of an injured man. “One of my friends was shot four times, and later that night one of the guys told me he’d died,” Martin says. “It wasn’t until the next day that one of my buddies told me he’d survived. And if that doesn’t prove there’s a God, nothing will.” After a large team of law enforcement officers secured the area, Martin and several other employees gathered outside the building, taking stock of who was missing and who was accounted for. “Someone asked the question ‘Is the shooter dead?’ And the trooper said ‘Yes, the shooter was shot by law enforcement.’ Everybody was clapping and applauding, and I was like, ‘Dude, that’s loss of life. Why are you applauding the loss of life?’ “Everybody deals with stress in different ways, and I get that, and I’m not giving them a hard time, but the way I saw it is: we lost life.” While Martin says he was not close to Ford, he is committed to remembering him as the guy with the 2014 Dodge Challenger who proudly displayed his massive car stereo, with which he entered sound system competitions. “That’s who I knew, and that’s who I’m going to remember,” he says. “But everybody sees the guy who shot up a place. Nobody’s seeing the illness. Nobody’s seeing the mental problems that he had. “That’s what I want people to remember, that depression and alcoholism are two very serious problems that often get overlooked.” Since Thursday, pastor Burkholder’s church has made itself available for any Hesston residents in need of counselling. He says he planned a Sunday sermon on the book of Ezra, but in light of the tragedy he will be preaching on the inner peace offered by the Holy Spirit and the communal strength that can be found in the aftermath of tragedy. He feels, he says, just as secure in Hesston as he ever did. “I have a 21-year-old daughter,” he says, “and even when she was five years old I knew she could walk home from school and I wouldn’t worry about anything bad happening to her. For me, that hasn’t changed. “I refuse to be afraid. I don’t want to be naive, but at some level you have to trust people – and I trust the people of Hesston.”",2016-02-28 08:32:40,"In Hesston, Kansas, small town America copes with another mass shooting","politics and government,abortion,religion and churches,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
355,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/11/barack-obama-us-budget-2017-gun-control,"The president’s budget proposal includes a wide range of initiatives that might reduce gun death and injury – not all of them focused on guns or gun control Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.18 BST Barack Obama’s $4.1tn budget for 2017 includes funding for a wide variety of gun violence prevention measures, from increased mental health spending to grants for innovative policing programs and funding to support the nation’s background check system for gun sales. Whether the US president’s proposed budget will amount to much more than a progressive wishlist is unclear. Breaking with precedent, congressional Republicans have announced they will not even listen to testimony from the president’s budget director this year.  “This isn’t even a budget so much as it is a progressive manual for growing the federal government at the expense of hardworking Americans,” the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, said in a statement this week. There are more than 30,000 gun deaths in America each year, including roughly 20,000 gun suicides and 11,000 gun homicides. Despite a series of emotional speeches about the toll of gun violence in America, Obama has struggled to have an impact on the problem. Congress rejected Obama’s push to tighten gun laws after a mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. Obama’s high-profile announcement of new executive actions on guns last month has been criticized for being all talk and little action. The president’s much-heralded plan to expand background checks on gun sales amounted to little more than “an updated web page and 10,000 pamphlets that federal agents will give out at gun shows”, the New York Times reported last week. But the small print of Obama’s 2017 budget proposal reveals a wider range of initiatives that might reduce gun death and injury – not all of them focused on guns or gun control. Obama’s Justice Department budget includes proposed increases for a series of modest grant programs that address urban violence, which often involves guns. Roughly half of America’s total gun homicide victims are black men. Last year, cities across the country reported increases in shootings and gun homicides. Obama’s budget request acknowledged upticks in crime and violence in “many cities”, while noting that “violent crime rates generally are still at historic lows”. Obama’s budget includes $5m to support the Justice Department’s new Violence Reduction Network, which connects high-violence cities with advice, training and easier access to federal resources. Founded in 2014, the network currently works with 10 cities, including Oakland, Camden, Chicago, Wilmington, Flint and Detroit. The new funding would allow more cities to join the network, the budget request noted. Justice Department officials have said there are roughly four dozen cities with violent crime rates high enough to qualify to join the program. The president also requested $18m for community-based violence prevention initiatives and $24m for a program that focuses on improving safety in high-crime hot spots. These programs help cities adopt innovative crime prevention strategies that have shown evidence of saving lives. In past years, the number of cities applying for these programs has dramatically outpaced the funding available. After a year of constant protests over police shootings of black Americans, Obama also requested a total of $129m for programs to build community trust. The Counted, a Guardian project that tracked every police killing in 2015, found that young black men were nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by police officers. Obama’s Justice Department budget includes increases of $17.5m for two different programs on police body cameras, $5m for a grant program to “improve diversity in law enforcement” and $20.0m to “facilitate community and law enforcement engagement” and to test ways to “reduce implicit bias and support racial reconciliation”. The Counted also found that more than one in every five cases of people killed by the police involved mental health issues. The trust-building initiative includes a proposed $7.5m “to establish an institute of excellence to improve police-based responses to people with mental illness, thereby improving both community and officer safety”. Obama’s budget also includes a proposed $500m in new mental health funding, which would expand the behavioral health workforce and provide funding for early intervention programs. “High-profile mass shootings tend to shine a light on those few mentally unstable people who inflict harm on others,” Obama said at the January press conference on gun violence. “But the truth is, is that nearly two in three gun deaths are from suicides. So a lot of our work is to prevent people from hurting themselves.” The president’s budget for the Department of Health and Human Services included a $28m increase for a national strategy on suicide prevention, which would be modeled in part on an effort that “led to an 18% reduction in deaths by suicide in Scotland”, the budget request noted. The funding would go towards implementing a “zero suicide” strategy for people already in the behavioral health system, as well as to provide grants to help identify people at risk for suicide and link them to services. “Suicidal individuals often fall through cracks in a fragmented, and sometimes distracted, healthcare system,” the department’s budget noted. The president also asked for an increase of $36m to hire an additional 200 special agents and investigators for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The goal of hiring more agents, Obama said in January, was “to ensure the smart and effective enforcement of gun safety laws that are already on the books”. Record-breaking gun sales over the past year have driven an increase in the number of background check requests. Obama’s budget includes an additional $35m to help the nation’s background check system “keep pace” with these increases. It also maintains $75m in funding for a comprehensive school safety research program, a new program created by Congress after the Sandy Hook shooting.",2016-02-11 08:53:54,Obama's $4.1tn budget for 2017 includes many measures to prevent gun violence,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC Apple CEO Tim Cook discusses the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus during the Apple event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2015. Police and prosecutors in New York City said Thursday that the encryption technology on Apple mobile phones is now routinely hindering criminal investigations, and they predict the problem could grow worse as more criminals figure out how well the devices keep secrets. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said at a news conference that investigators cannot access 175 Apple devices sitting in his cybercrime lab because of encryption embedded in the company's latest operating systems. ""They're warrant proof,"" he said, adding that the inability to peer inside the devices was especially problematic because so much evidence once stored in file cabinets, on paper, and in vaults, is now only on criminals' smartphones. Up until recently, Apple routinely helped law enforcement officials unlock phones deemed important to an investigation. (According to the New York Times, the company provided data in response to more than 3,000 requests in the first half of 2015.) But it stopped helping when it involved devices loaded with its encrypted operating system, iOS 8, and last fall stopped altogether even with phones using earlier, non-encrypted OS. Apple's line in the sand? A drug case in Brooklyn involving a suspect who forgot his password on an iPhone running iOS 7. ""Forcing Apple to extract data in this case, absent clear legal authority to do so, could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand,"" argued Apple's lawyer in a Brooklyn federal court. Former NSA Chief Michael Hayden Sides With Apple, Though Admits 'No Encryption Is Unbreakable' Apple has marketed its new encryption data as an important privacy tool, and many privacy advocates have praised the company, saying that if it opened its devices to government surveillance that ability to spy on users could be abused in places with authoritarian regimes. The Times agrees with that position. In an editorial published on Thursday, the paper noted that some Government officials have proposed creating legislation that would require phone and computer makers to maintain a so-called “back door” to encrypted data on devices. “Congress would do great harm by requiring such back doors,” the Times editorial board writes. “Criminals and domestic and foreign intelligence agencies could exploit such features to conduct mass surveillance and steal national and trade secrets. There’s a very good chance that such a law, intended to ease the job of law enforcement, would make private citizens, businesses and the government itself far less secure.” The Cupertino, Ca.-based company is currently fighting a federal magistrate's order to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by a gunman in December's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. A deadline to reply to the order was originally set for next Tuesday but has been extended to Friday, Feb. 26, according to Bloomberg. Apple's Tim Cook Forcefully Resists Federal Order to Hack Phone in Terror Case Vance, the D.A., didn't specify which cases were being hindered. But NYC Police Commissioner William Bratton said a phone seized in the investigation of the shooting of two police officers in the Bronx last month is among those detectives can't crack. Bratton said criminals are increasingly aware of the protection offered by their devices. He said a prisoner in a city jail was recently recorded saying in a phone call that iPhone encryption was ""another gift from God."" An Apple spokesman did not immediately return a call Thursday for comment on the concerns of New York City authorities. Apple CEO Tim Cook has warned that creating software allowing the FBI to unlock the San Bernardino suspect's phone could make millions of other phones vulnerable to hackers and criminals. Cook said that if Apple were forced by the courts to ""hack our own users,"" the government could order the company to build surveillance software to intercept all sorts of messages, ""access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone's microphone or camera without your knowledge."" According to the Times, complying with the FBI’s order would create a dangerous precedent. “Writing new code would have an effect beyond unlocking one phone. If Apple is required to help the F.B.I. in this case, courts could require it to use this software in future investigations or order it to create new software to fit new needs. It is also theoretically possible that hackers could steal the software from the company’s servers.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry © 2021 Billboard Media, LLC.

358,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/kansas-factory-shooting-cedric-ford,"Authorities identify Cedric Ford, who was shot dead by police, as the gunman in shooting spree that left three people dead and several critically injured Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 20.56 BST The gunman who killed three people in Kansas on Thursday was served with a protective order by police just 90 minutes before the shooting, the local sheriff has said. Sheriff T Walton named Cedric Ford, 38, as the shooter in a news conference early on Friday morning. Ford was shot dead by police at the factory in Hesston where he had worked before the rampage. Walton said that Ford was an employee of the factory, Excel Industries, a manufacturer of lawn care products about 35 miles north of Wichita.  About 90 minutes before the shooting, police served Ford with a protection of abuse order, Walton said. The orders are usually served “because there’s some type of violence in a relationship”, the sheriff said, but he declined to specify the nature of the relationship in question. When Ford was served with the order, “he didn’t display anything that was outrageous”, Walton said. “He just displayed that he was a little upset that he was getting this order.” The order was prompted by an incident at the factory, Walton said, and would be investigated as a “trigger” to the attack. But Ford’s motivations in the apparently indiscriminate shooting are still unclear, the sheriff cautioned. Asked why the gunman chose Excel Industries, Walton shrugged: “He worked there.” The sheriff had earlier described the shootings, in which the gunman injured two men on the street and a woman in parking lot before he entered the factory, as “random”. Ford wounded at least 14 people, several critically. The three victims killed were all at the factory. “The shooter was actively firing at any target,” the sheriff said. “This is a horrible situation – just terrible, terrible.” Barack Obama commented on the shooting on Friday afternoon, saying: “We cannot become numb to this.” “This happens far too many times and affected far too many innocent Americans,” he told reporters at a stop in Florida. “The real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine.” Public records show that Ford, raised in south Florida, had several criminal charges and convictions in his native state. In the early 2000s, he was convicted of burglary, grand theft and fleeing from an officer, and in 1997 he was convicted for an illegal concealed firearm. He was released from the Florida prison system in 2007, and in Kansas he had a misdemeanor conviction for brawling in 2008. Police found a .223-caliber assault-style rifle and a handgun on the suspect after he was shot dead. Public records show that he lived in a mobile home park in nearby Newton, near to where he first shot a pedestrian from inside a car. Federal prosecutors announced Friday afternoon that they had filed charges against Sarah Hopkins, a 28-year-old Newton woman who allegedly provided Ford with a semi-automatic rifle and a handgun. Hopkins was aware that Ford was a convicted felon who was prohibited from possessing firearms, according to an affidavit filed by the US attorney’s office in Kansas. The woman is charged with one count of knowingly transferring a firearm to a felon. Erin McDaniel, a spokeswoman for Newton, said Ford was known to local authorities, but she declined to elaborate. Recent photos from Ford’s Facebook page show him in a car with a handgun and a bottle of gin, and holding a handgun and an AK-47-style rifle, complaining about his car being towed, and with family. Last September he posted a video of himself firing the rifle into a field. More recent videos are mundane: a visit to the zoo, music videos, memes. He appears in many photos and videos with two children, at the zoo and at home. Occasionally he left short messages about his troubles, as in September 2015 when he wrote about “feeling heartbroken”. Five days later he posted the rifle video, and a month later wrote: “It’s so hurtful when you have no one to talk about your problems.” But though he wrote about “feeling fed up” on 16 January, he was “feeling blessed” two weeks later. Ford listed his occupation as a painter at Excel, but Walton said they had no reason to believe the three people killed were targeted specifically. Excel coworker Martin Espinoza, who narrowly escaped the gunman when Ford ran out of ammunition, told the Associated Press that the man was typically pretty calm. Other coworkers told CBS that he was acting normally when he arrived for his shift on Thursday. Local news KWCH obtained a copy of the restraining order placed against Ford, in which the complainant described him as “an alcoholic, violent, depressed”. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical [and] psychological help,” the complainant wrote. The person who requested the order also described the incident of concern, saying that on 5 February, a verbal fight “became physical by him pushing then grabbing me”. “He placed me in a chokehold from behind – I couldn’t breath – he then got me to ground while choking me – finally releasing me.” The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have joined the investigation, but a spokesperson for the latter agency said the shooting appears to have no connection to terrorist groups. Walton downplayed speculation that Ford was either disgruntled about work or upset about a relationship, saying that police had dozens of interviews to take and searching to do. “We’re only about 15 hours into this,” he said. He lauded the work of local police departments, in particular the officer who killed the gunman in a firefight. Because there were as many as 200 people in the factory at the time, Walton said, the officer was a “tremendous hero”. “Had that Hesston officer not done what he did, this would be a whole lot more tragic,” Walton said. The Hesston police had just last week practiced for a mass shooting scenario. They have not yet released the names of any victims. “I’ve been here for 28 years, as sheriff for eight years,” Walton added. “I’ve never seen anything like this. As far as we don’t think it’s every going to happen here. Well, isn’t that what every sheriff says that’s stuck up on the podium like I am.” At about 3.30pm on Thursday, Wichita police served Ford with a restraining order from someone who sought protection from abuse. The order was prompted by an earlier incident at Excel Industries, the factory where Ford worked, but police did not describe what happened in detail. Ford left work for a break. Not long before 5pm, Ford drove into the town of Newton, firing a gun from inside his car. He struck a man in the shoulder. Police had their first 911 call at 4.57pm from the victim. He then drove into oncoming traffic, police said, and his car and another went into a ditch. Ford shot the other driver at an intersection and stole that person’s truck, which he drove to the Excel factory in Hesston. Around 5pm, the gunman arrived at the factory, where more than 200 people were working at the time, according to police. Ford shot a third victim in the parking lot. Ford then entered the main assembly room of the factory, where dozens of people work, and began firing at everyone in sight. He killed three people and injured 11 others there. Police arrived at the scene within minutes of the gunman’s first shots at the factory, and exchanged fire with Ford. An officer shot and killed him, and police recovered a .223-caliber assault-style rifle and a handgun on his body. From the moment he struck the first victim in Newton to his death the shooting lasted about 26 minutes, police said.",2016-02-26 12:01:23,Kansas shooting: suspect was served protection order before killings,"police,murders and attempted murders,violence",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
359,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/inside-the-fbis-encryption-battle-with-apple,"For months, the FBI searched for a compelling case that would force Apple to weaken iPhone security – and then the San Bernardino shooting happened Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 20.59 BST Two weeks ago, the FBI called Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, with a jarring message: the agency wanted Apple to help them hack an iPhone. Apple refused. The request stepped up a level on 16 February when a federal magistrate ordered Apple to help the FBI unlock a single iPhone – the phone belonging to one of the killers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. Apple again refused.  But this carefully planned legal battle has been months in the making, US officials and tech executives told the Guardian, as the government and Apple try to settle whether national security can dictate how Silicon Valley writes computer code. Both sides expect the ensuing legal battle to have far-reaching implications that will touch on encryption, law enforcement, digital privacy and a 227-year-old law from America’s post-colonial days. “The law operates on precedent, so the fundamental question here isn’t whether the FBI gets access to this particular phone,” said Julian Sanchez, a surveillance law expert at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute in Washington. “It’s whether a catch-all law from 1789 can be used to effectively conscript technology companies into producing hacking tools and spyware for the government.” Apple and the government, observers and people close to the case said, want to set a legal precedent about where digital security ends and national security begins after nearly two years of hearings, open letters and Washington-Silicon Valley shadowboxing. Speculation has already begun about how far both sides are willing to go in appealing unfavorable rulings. The politics are tricky. Apple is popular and code is protected by America’s free-speech law. Privacy advocates planned to gather at Apple stores across the US in support of the iPhone maker. On the other hand, one technology executive Wednesday acknowledged, “it’s an incredibly sympathetic case” from the governments’s perspective. “Apple chose to protect a dead Isis terrorist’s privacy over the security of the American people,” Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas wrote in a statement. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a impassioned statement: “We have no sympathy for terrorists. But now the US government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.” The House judiciary committee plans to hold a hearing on the matter 1 March and has invited Apple, a person familiar with the matter said. Apple’s actions in this case require some context. In September 2014, Apple introduced new encryption into its iPhone operating system that would make it mathematically impossible for the company to unlock them for investigators. This was a departure from the past, when investigators could get access to a device if they sent it to Apple headquarters with a search warrant. The shift was in response to increased digital privacy concerns and distrust of America’s digital spies following revelations from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Since then, FBI director James Comey has been trying to figure out a way around the software as he and Apple’s Cook have traded barbs publicly and privately. Comey hit a snag, however: the Obama administration didn’t want to pick a fight with one of America’s most popular – and valuable – companies. In October 2015, the director abandoned his push for legislation that would require Silicon Valley to maintain some sort of way to unlock smartphones and inboxes for investigators. Since then, the Obama administration has sounded notes of cooperation, sending officials to Silicon Valley for what they billed as an air-clearing discussion. Comey’s later rounds of rhetoric focused on mutual interests in safety and privacy felt in Washington hearing rooms and Palo Alto boardrooms. But their tones have shifted in the past week. Comey testified on 9 February that the FBI was unable to unlock the San Bernardino iPhone. His NSA counterpart, Adm Michael Rogers, called encryption “foundational to the future” in a January appearance, but said on 17 February that the terrorists who killed about 130 people in Paris in November would not have been successful had security agencies penetrated their encrypted communications. In the meantime, Justice Department lawyers believed they had found another way into a locked iPhone. The All Writs Act, passed in 1789, gives judges broad authority to ensure their orders are fulfilled. Justice Department lawyers believed it would provide an underpinning for forcing companies to grant them access, sources said. But some of the test cases that involved modern technology companies were either low profile or didn’t fit the right set of circumstances to set a precedent. Apple lawyers, regardless, began studying the law and preparing counter-arguments after these initial test cases. The law, they argued, can’t be used to force a company to rework how it makes products. On 2 December a husband and wife opened fire on a local government office building in southern California. The FBI quickly said the two suspects, who both practiced Islam, had been “radicalized” and declared the incident a terrorist attack. One of the suspects, Syed Farook, had worked for the county, which meant the government owned his iPhone 5C. With a search warrant, Apple provided the FBI data from weekly backups Farook made with Apple’s iCloud service. But those backups stopped on 19 October, according to a federal search warrant request. FBI investigators believed there was more data about Farook’s motives in the phone but couldn’t get to it without unlocking the device. The phone’s contents were encrypted and Apple didn’t have the four-digit passcode. Modern iPhones also have an optional feature that will erase all data on the phone with 10 incorrect passcode entries. FBI agents weren’t willing to take the risk. So FBI lawyers came up with a clever request for Apple: don’t turn off the encryption – just make it easier for agents to guess the password as many times as they wanted. Eileen Decker, the US attorney for the central district of California, took the lead on the case, supported by the Justice Department’s national security division in Washington. In their view, the access they sought was narrow and didn’t rely on undermining encryption standards. This model of phone, the 5C, did not run Secure Enclave, Apple’s newer and more robust encryption measure, leaving department officials convinced that they could hive off the heart of the “backdoor” debate from the specific San Bernardino case. In the 16 February court order, Apple was told to build software that, when combined with the unique identification number, would allow the FBI to guess Farook’s password as many times as it wanted. The court also ordered Apple to disable a feature that added a delay after multiple incorrect passcode entries. And since a four-digit passcode has only about 10,000 possible combinations, a powerful computer could plow through guesses fairly quickly, a technology executive said. US officials on Wednesday stressed that their request for Apple is only limited to Farook’s phone. “The judge’s order and our request in this case do not require Apple to redesign its products, to disable encryption or to open content on the phone,” the Justice Department said in a statement on 17 February. But Apple said that it would be impossible to limit the technology to this case. Once Apple built such an investigative tool, any iPhone’s security system – even the most modern ones – could be weakened by it, an Apple executive said. Dan Guido, co-founder of security analyst Trail of Bits, called such a system, “FBiOS”, a riff on Apple’s smartphone operating system iOS. Additionally, Apple’s lawyers are concerned that if a judge validates the FBI’s use of the All Writs Act in this case, it will give the government sweeping authority to dictate how Silicon Valley builds products in the future. “We are challenging the FBI’s demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country,” Cook wrote in his letter. “We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications.” To Justice Department officials, San Bernardino is a long-awaited test case. In October 2014, the FBI’s James Comey first told a Washington audience that encryption on mobile devices effectively left law enforcement “dark” to emerging threats. Ever since, officials believed it was only a matter of time until they came upon a case like the San Bernardino shootings: a device from a terrorist whose lock screen they couldn’t bypass by guesswork to get at the data held on the phone, and not in Apple’s iCloud. “This wasn’t a fluke they picked this one,” said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who advises technology companies and the government on encryption. “They’re always strategic in how they do these things.” Both sides are gaming out how far their legal strategies will go. Amid speculation that the case is sure to reach the supreme court, litigation is almost certain. There are precedents for the Justice Department backing down: in 2012, it chose not to challenge a decision by the 11th circuit court of appeals in Atlanta that it could not compel a suspect in a child abuse image case to decrypt his hard drives, something it considered crosswise with the fifth amendment’s protections against self-incrimination. Senior law enforcement officials were briefed on the decision to go after Apple in such a high-profile way, sources said. The FBI also appears to have been preparing its press strategy for the search warrant for weeks. They expected Apple to push back heavily: Cook, who has managed threats from China to force decryption of the iPhone, had taken unyielding stances against backdoors, both in the US and overseas, where a host of foreign countries are debating or have passed measures to give their security services access to customer data from Apple and other firms. US law enforcement officials were less concerned about the precedent they were setting for foreign governments than in the task at hand: compel Apple to allow them to unlock the phone. At a closed-door January meeting with national security officials in San Jose, Cook urged the Obama administration to make a public statement in support of strong encryption. That statement was never made. But on Wednesday night, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai posted several messages on Twitter backing Apple. Giving law enforcement officials occasional access to user data is “wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data”. If the bureau succeeds, it “could be a troubling precedent”.",2016-02-18 01:00:26,Inside the FBI's encryption battle with Apple,"privacy,computers and the internet,computer software,telephones and telecommunications",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
360,http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/16/kanye-west-twitter-rant-mark-zuckerberg-larry-page-silicon-valley-tech,"After the hip-hop mogul’s latest Twitter rant requesting funding from Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page, we tried to find out who he knows in Silicon Valley Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.00 BST There appears to be some truth to Kanye West’s claim that he has met “all the tech guys”. The Chicago hip-hop mogul this weekend declared he is $53m in debt and requested funding from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Google cofounder Larry Page. He then threw down this 70-character gauntlet:  All you guys had meetings with me and no one lifted a finger to help…. The Guardian wasn’t able to determine the true nature of West’s finances, but he does appear to have more than a few friends in Silicon Valley, based on public press accounts and interviews with several tech executives. He frequently shows up at Apple’s southern California office, is friends with rap-obsessed venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, has reportedly dined with an Instagram founder, and has some sort of social relationship with Dropbox chief executive Drew Houston. The interactions go back at least half a decade. Kanye stopped by the SpaceX rocket factory today. pic.twitter.com/6z7gHBn6 There’s some context here. The entertainment industry and tech have long had a fascination with each other. For music titans such as West, Nas, MC Hammer and Justin Bieber, it’s become a way to grow serious businessperson bona fides. For technologists, it’s the ultimate revenge of the nerds. Some of West’s early interactions with Silicon Valley were well-documented by Gawker’s tech industry gossip site Valleywag. In 2012 and 2013, the producer and rapper began pitching his latest vision, Donda, to investors. It was presented as a sort of hip man’s General Electric that would have its fingers in everything from fashion and publishing to “alternative energy sources” and “hovercrafts”. Here is my Donda chart that I wrote 4 years ago that everyone laughed at… pic.twitter.com/g1po6Z3H55 Perhaps trying to grease the levers of finance, West invited several tech thought leaders to his 2013 engagement party at San Francisco’s AT&T Park, home of the Giants. Horowitz, the cofounder of mega venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, was there, as was Dropbox’s Houston. Another person present: Mahbod Moghadam, the controversial cofounder of Rap Genius, the Andreessen Horowitz-backed company that helps people understand rap lyrics. “They’re tight. It’s cute,” Moghadam, who now works at Everipedia, said of Horowitz and West. Moghadam left Rap Genius in 2014 after comments he made about a mass shooting at the University of California Santa Barbara. “In their defense, I did do a lot of stupid things,” he said. Dropbox and Andreessen Horowitz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. It couldn’t be learned what relationship, if any, West maintains with executives at some of the biggest Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook, Twitter, Uber and Alphabet (the artists formerly known as Google), although he has dined with Kevin Systrom, the cofounder of Facebook-owned Instagram. But he does appear to have a working relationship with Apple, a less-than-surprising development given the iPhone maker’s work with streaming music these days – even if he did declare his new album The Life of Pablo would “never never never” be on Apple’s iTunes Store and would be exclusive to the streaming service Tidal. At Apple’s southern California headquarters, where former record executive Jimmy Iovine helps run Apple music, West is sometimes found hanging out in Iovine’s office, a person familiar with the meetings said. In his Twitter posts on 14 February, West asked Zuckerberg for $1bn to help handle his debts and bring Donda, his startup idea, to fruition. As Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, noted on Twitter, that’s a lot of money these days, even in Silicon Valley. Maybe in 2015. But in 2016 probably only like $500M. https://t.co/QpOzpT36zA",2016-02-16 18:42:48,How many 'tech guys' has Kanye West actually met?

361,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-kalamazoo-shooter-motive-20160224-story.html,"KALAMAZOO, MICH. — Investigators say they are baffled. Neighbors are totally bewildered. All around this traumatized city, residents wonder whether they will ever learn why Jason Brian Dalton allegedly gunned down random strangers while picking up fares for Uber. This week, as police continued looking for clues into Saturday's shootings, so did people close to him. One neighbor was puzzled to learn Dalton, 45, was driving for Uber and not working for Progressive Insurance anymore. ""He left every morning at 8 a.m. like he was going to work,"" the neighbor said. Where he was going, what he was enduring, what he was thinking - mass-shooting experts say all these fragments will eventually coalesce into a motive that probably made perfect sense to the killer, even it's incomprehensible to everyone else. ""In these cases, people typically don't just snap and go berserk,"" said James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist and author of several books on mass murders. ""It may seem senseless, but there's always a reason."" For investigators, sorting that out takes time. For everyone else, the waiting is agonizing, a cruel ritual in the age of mass shootings. So far, all investigators have been able to offer is Dalton's statement that ""he took people's lives."" ""This first thing I thought of was, why?"" said Kalamazoo resident Lisa Stavish, 33. ""Everyone I know is talking about it, but no one really knows anything."" In some mass shootings, the reason is almost immediately apparent. A married couple in San Bernardino, California, stockpiled bombs and ammunition for a shooting motivated by radical Islamist beliefs. In Colorado, a religious drifter with bitter beliefs about abortion is charged with killing three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic. Dylann Roof, who had expressed his hatred of African Americans, stands accused of killing nine of them in a Charleston, South Carolina, church. But most mass shootings aren't that simple to unravel. Experts say they typically combine precipitating events that might seem like everyday problems - work, money, love - with undiagnosed or untreated mental health issues. Sometimes the idea for a mass shooting unfolds over months. Other times, it's days. ""It's not something he did spontaneously,"" Fox said. In many ways, Dalton fits the typical profile of a mass shooter - a white male with no criminal record, no psychological impairment known to those around him, and the ability to legally purchase firearms. What makes him different, Fox said, is that he ""killed people in the wrong place at the wrong time."" Meaning he targeted total strangers without a specific setting. Most mass killers, even if they target strangers, single out specific places for attacks. Students pick schools. Disgruntled workers pick their workplaces. Those making political statements choose symbolically important places. Dalton's setting was the entire city of Kalamazoo, making his motive more difficult to piece together. Man charged in Kalamazoo shootings had no barriers to guns J. Reid Meloy, a psychiatry professor at the University of California at San Diego who studies mass murderers, said investigators typically find ""a mental state that is coming apart"" and recent stressors causing difficultly in life. ""We think there's an event that starts the clock,"" he said. ""But the predisposition to commit a mass murder has often been there for quite some time."" What may have been Dalton's event? Working for Uber, as Dalton had been since late last month, is a clue that might indicate he needed extra money or that he couldn't find a regular job. If he had a grudge against Uber, killing strangers while picking up fares could make total sense to him. But there's also a danger in being too reductive. Meloy said mass killers are often in a depressed and paranoid state, though there's usually a kernel of truth that they feed on. While stressing that he was not talking specifically about Dalton, Meloy said that in cases appearing to take place randomly, ""the individual has placed victims into a pseudo community."" Uber was something he apparently kept from those around him, including the neighbor, James Bloch. They often talked about politics, guns and other current events through their backyard fence. As far as he knew, Dalton was still working for Progressive, including driving a company van. ""Probably around seven months ago he stopped driving it,"" Bloch said. ""And I asked him what was up with it - they said they were downsizing and they weren't using the company vehicle anymore, that he had to use his own vehicle."" In recent weeks, Bloch noticed that Dalton would return home at odd times: 11 a.m., 3 p.m. ""He never came home at the same time,"" Bloch said. ""It was always different."" Was he depressed? Bloch said no. Did he seem mad about something? Bloch said no. One of the riders Dalton picked up said he began driving erratically after getting a phone call. But it is not known whom the call was from and whether it somehow set him off. Even if a motive is not readily apparent yet, Fox said, ""clearly something was going on making him miserable and unhappy. And if he's miserable and unhappy, then other people need to suffer, too."" To Fox and other experts, it seems clear Dalton was quietly planning something. A local gun-store owner said Dalton came in Saturday, the day of the killings, to buy a vest for concealing handguns. And then there's his alleged steely demeanor during the attacks, still picking up customers and reportedly switching vehicles. ""That reflects the calmness that is typical in mass killers,"" Fox said, noting that many mass killers are seen smiling while shooting. ""Because they plan their crime, if only in their head, it's something comfortable to them. So they are calm and cool and the rest of us are totally caught by surprise."" One characteristic Dalton does not share with other mass killers: He's still alive. Most mass shooters kill themselves or are killed by police. That leaves open the possibility that Dalton will eventually explain his actions to authorities or a court-appointed psychiatrist. So far, he's mum on that topic. ""From what detectives told me, he is unaffected, kind of monotone,"" said Kalamazoo Police Chief Jeff Hadley. ""Showed no emotion relative to the offense. It's really just baffling.""

362,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/apple-challenges-chilling-demand-decrypt-san-bernadino-iphone,"Tim Cook publicly attacks the US government for asking Apple to take an ‘unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers’ Last modified on Wed 29 Nov 2017 02.22 GMT Apple has hit back after a US federal magistrate ordered the company to help the FBI unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, with chief executive Tim Cook describing the demand as “chilling”. The court order focuses on Apple’s security feature that slows down anyone trying to use “brute force” to gain access to an iPhone by guessing its passcode. In a letter published on the company’s website, Cook responded saying Apple would oppose the order and calling for public debate.  “The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand,” he wrote. While Cook took pains to stress that Apple was “shocked and outraged” by the San Bernardino shooting last December – “we have no sympathy for terrorists” – he said company is determined to push back against the court order. Cook wrote that opposing the order “is not something we take lightly”. “We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the US government,” he added. “Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the US government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone,” he wrote. “Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation.” Cook claimed that “in the wrong hands” this software could be used to unlock “any iPhone in someone’s physical possession”, and warned that Apple would not be able to guarantee that the software would only be used by the FBI in this case. “The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers — including tens of millions of American citizens — from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals,” he wrote. “The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe. We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack.” FBI director James Comey has said that his agents are searching for evidence about the mass shooting on 2 December 2015 which killed 14, but have been locked out of one of the killers’ phone. The investigators are trying to determine to what extent married couple Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik were influenced by radical Islamic terrorist groups, as well as who they had been communicating with before the shootings. Investigators have been unable to access Farook’s iPhone 5C Sheri Pym, the federal judge, has ordered Apple not to turn off its encryption but to make it easier for federal agents to randomly guess the iPhone’s passcode. Apple has built a security feature into iPhones so that a phone slows down anyone trying to “brute force” his way into a phone by guessing passcode after passcode. The built-in delay is so substantial that Apple said it would take someone 5 1/2 years to guess every possible code for a single device. The court order requires Apple to circumvent that delay. “[Apple] will ensure that when the FBI submits passcodes to the SUBJECT DEVICE, software running on the device will not purposefully introduce any additional delay between passcode attempts beyond what is incurred Apple hardware,” it reads. The magistrate also wants Apple to turn off any “auto-erase” functions on the phone, if enabled. This will be done with a program Apple is ordered to write and will allow FBI agents to install it on the suspect’s phone at a federal or Apple facility, according to the order. Apple is allowed to provide a cost estimate and rebuttal if it “believes that compliance with the Order would be unreasonably burdensome”. It also allowed Apple the option of coming up with another way to achieve the same result. Some security experts believe it would be technically possible for Apple to comply with the court order because the phone in question is an older model, while it probably wouldn’t be possible on a newer iPhone due to improvements in security. In his letter, Cook claimed that the FBI’s use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify its request also could have a knock-on effect. The 225-year-old law gives courts broad authority to ensure their orders are fulfilled. “The implications of the government’s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone’s device to capture their data,” he wrote. “The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone’s microphone or camera without your knowledge.” Cook concludes: “We are challenging the FBI’s demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country. We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications. “While we believe the FBI’s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.” Digital-rights body the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has thrown its weight behind Apple’s stance, in a blog post written by its deputy executive director and general counsel, Kurt Opsahl. “Essentially, the government is asking Apple to create a master key so that it can open a single phone. And once that master key is created, we’re certain that our government will ask for it again and again, for other phones, and turn this power against any software or device that has the audacity to offer strong security,” wrote Opsahl. “The US government wants us to trust that it won’t misuse this power. But we can all imagine the myriad ways this new authority could be abused. Even if you trust the US government, once this master key is created, governments around the world will surely demand that Apple undermine the security of their citizens as well.”",2016-02-17 04:17:47,Apple challenges 'chilling' demand to decrypt San Bernardino shooter's iPhone,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

2.6.2016 1:00 PM Internet trolls, be gone! Popular publications and social media sites are stepping up their censorship of interactive spaces, shielding the delicate eyes of the common commenter from every kind of digital taboo, from spam to hate speech. Twitter's transition from free speech service to safe space began last March with a ban on revenge porn. A month later, tweets deemed to incite terrorism joined the ban-wagon. Then came any comment that could provoke violence ""on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, or disability."" The Guardian has followed suit, forbidding ""toxic commentary"" on a wide variety of subjects, from race and immigration, to Islam. Reuters, CNN, and the Chicago Sun-Times have either ditched their comments sections or have restricted them into near oblivion. These are potentially expensive, unfair, and ineffective tactics for coping with online vitriol. Establishing clear definitions for ""hate speech"" can be a semantic mine field of subjective and contradictory interpretations. The humorless algorithms guiding software censor-bots can unthinkingly delete constructive criticism. These measures are likely to discourage the very audience participation and smart commentary that makes the web an exciting and democratic place to be. But it's not illegal. The censorship of private organizations is limited by the will of their owners, subject to the immediate accountability of a fickle and fiercely competitive online marketplace of news and social media. By contrast, governments are limited in their ability to curtail free speech, though where the state draws the lines is always a tricky endeavor. When does free speech become a legitimate threat of violence? The state of Montana was recently put to just such a test. An angry loner in the picturesque mountain town of Whitefish was sentenced to five months in prison for anti-Semitic tweets. Did police avert a mass shooting? Or is this the kind of law enforcement overreach that the First amendment was designed to stop?  NEXT: The Collapse of Oil IS the Economic Boom Todd Krainin was a producer at Reason.

I have been reading about the tyrants of Sicily (think ancient Greek city states), and the author of the book explains that when a city’s citizens want to take over from an oligarchy, they end up having to support a general to do that, and then the general becomes tyrant. It makes sense that this becomes a human pattern over the ages. Its also a bit frightening. “They replace the priest by a king, the king by an oligarchy, the oligarchy by a despot, the despot by an aristocracy, the aristocrats by a majority, the majority by a tyrant, the tyrant by oligarchs, the oligarchs by aristocrats, the aristocrats by a king, the king by a parliament, the parliament by a dictator, the dictator by a king, the king by?. there’s six thousand years of it, in every language.” Not gallows, Woodchippers! “The censorship of private organizations is limited by the will of their owners, subject to the immediate accountability of a fickle and fiercely competitive online marketplace of news and social media.” ( Missing: Ostensibly, not so much under EU-antidiscrimination law, which extends to worldview/Weltanschauung. Of course these are mostly empty words. What’s the code for quoting? (Less than sign)blockquote(greater than sign) You can add the Communist Broadcasting Corporation in Canada to the list, they no longer allow any comments on stories dealing with aboriginal issues. You know who else thought [redacted] ought to be [redacted]? The [redacted], that’s who! Your [redacted] mother?… My mother? Let me [redacted] my mother. I’ve said for a while that the internet is a very interesting place to study human character. It’s one big social experiment where people get to build their own communities on subjects that interest them. And amazingly, when they do so, they end up instituting a whole bunch of restrictions on types of speech. They very often try to organize and pigeonhole everything. They put the most petty little sacks of shit in charge of moderating and censorship their users. Most enforce the rules they crafted themselves in a completely selective and blatantly hypocritical manner. It is, in short, a great representation of why libertarianism is dead in the water. When given a choice and a chance to organize on their own, people reveal a lot about themselves. Props to Reason for keeping its peanut gallery unrestricted despite the occasional federal subpoena. They put the most petty little sacks of shit in charge of moderating and censorship their users. Most enforce the rules they crafted themselves in a completely selective and blatantly hypocritical manner. This ought to be the standard disclaimer: “All rules are final and will be enforced randomly and sporadically by a loser who uses random sanctions based on whims and personal biases in a meaningless and anonymous internet forum to reinforce their sense of personal entitlement, false self-esteem and unwarranted self-importance” it’s a good thing our government, at least, is made up of mature adults who dont engage in that type of behavior. I’ve moderated all sorts of bulletin boards and internet channels of various kinds (not for the past twelve years, though), and I almost never had to exercise any censoring or banishment powers. Yet it seems like every single other person I’ve seen acting as a moderator of some sort feels compelled to exercise his powers at a more or less steady rate, regardless what’s going on,, and pretexts will be seized as necessary to keep the rate from slacking off. It’s like having the authority somehow creates a need to exercise it, even if the purpose for which it was legitimised is lacking. I’ve acted as moderator before. The only bannable offenses were a) spam, b) unprovoked personal attacks at other users (preceded by several warnings), and c) blatant racial, homophobic, gender slurs. Never banned because of content or tone except in those circumstances. Other moderators I watched would pull the trigger on opinions that were merely unpopular. I was banned from Boing Boing for saying that while Pinochet was no sweetheart, Chile would have been much worse off under communists. Eventually they dumped Disqus as their comment system, probably because too many people were showing up to disagree. This. I was banned for life by both Pando-online and RawStory…. for *one* comment each. that involved no cursing or even personal remarks. I take pride in this. Try getting banned from Panda-online. Is that like a Furry porn site? Hell if I know. But getting banned from a panda site seems… something. Of course you get banned; irreverence in the face of futility. Dees Bears is Maseggeinated!!. Haha. The last few times I have commented in moderated forums, it’s been that way. I’ve only very occasionally done so in the past dozen years, and in every case I ended up getting banished very quickly, the last two times after making a single comment with none of the objectional language or sentiment that characterises my normal speech. The last one did advocate legalising drugs, which is apparently a horrifying statement that should never be thought in some societies. In the old days, I used to get in a dozen or more comments, usually, and speaking quite liberally, before I got banished. People are certainly getting more afraid of bad thoughts on the internet than they used to be. Also why I put little stock in anarchism as a mode of libertarianism. Why would I be thrilled with efficient private-sector enforcement of the very things my neighbors support in every other area where they self-organize? At least government does the same thing ineffectively, and there’s a chance that system-builder types like the Founding Fathers can stem the tide of our worst impulses for a little longer than would usually be the case. Freedom of association. You reconciled that? I think most minarchists views government as necessary evil that should be limited. They identify the inconsistency, but think there is no other workable option. than what’s the difference between “anarchist” and “libertarian”? (I thought it was acknowledging that government is the least bad option) oh minarchists. my bad. the terms speak to two different dimensions. An anarchist opposes the state. The libertarian espouses the primacy of freedom. So, depending on one’s reasoning, the libertarian may also be an anarchist, but there are libertarians who do not see the state as inherently incompatible with freedom and so are not anarchists. Similarly, one may be an anarchist for other reasons, such as adherence to eschatological Marxism, wherein the obliteration of the state is seen as an inevitable step in the remaking of the earth and a new golden age of man. Or, you can be an anarchist because of Christian beliefs that no one is competent enough to serve as the vessel of collective force. thanks that’s a good explanation Or is this the kind of law enforcement overreach that the First amendment was designed to stop? I don’t remember reading anywhere in the text of the Bill of Rights that mentions twittering or instergrams or any of that socio-media mumbo jumbo. *bitterly clings to my flintlock and Aitken Bible* Is your Aiken bible made of Clay? *narrows gaze* Or automatic assault weapons with the thing that goes up and the clips!!1! Internet trolls, be gone! Popular publications and social media sites are stepping up their censorship of interactive spaces, shielding the delicate eyes of the common commenter from every kind of digital taboo, from spam to hate speech. They can all fuck off and die in a fire! But if that fire is in a theatre, watch out! I which case, I’m morally bound to silence. “Then came any comment that could provoke violence “on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, or disability.”” They forgot to mention ‘on the basis of grapefruit’. Are you still running for president? I was working as campaign manager for Almanian before his untimely poisoning by hillary’s assassins. Do you know anything more about Almanian’s circumstances/condition? Sounded awfully grim. No. I hope he’s ok. Out of the hospital and at home, where he’s doing boring shit like changing light bulbs. Out of the hospital and at home Good to hear, thanks. that makes the web an exciting and democratic place to be Uh, no. It is not “democratic”. Thank Jeebus it isn’t democratic. “Democratic” is mob rule. Though there are certainly plenty of people who would love to make the web more “democratic”. I propose to expel Episiarch from Hit & Run for repeated violation of our dignity and sensibilities. ALL IN FAVOR? Whats a dingity? I tried looking it up and i still dont get it You got to bag it up. (goes to walmart in search of diggity bags) they really dont make boy bands like they used to (hands out other people’s money to commenters to buy votes) “Democracy” in action, bitches! We must ban the influence of money in this voting process! How else can Episiarch be made to leave? I guess I never really thought about it: what does Episiarch (the name) mean? Here you go. Sweet mother of Abraham Lincoln! Now I’ll never get the nerd stench out of here! Yet still awesome. So. How much ($) for each vote? And is this like standard Democratic Party rules, where multiple votes and votes by dead people are allowed? Rules? What rules? Here, have some more cash. Cool. Now tell me what my name means. It means that I regret that we meet in this way. You and I are of a kind. In a different reality, I could have called you friend. In other words… is that woman playing a bicycle rim? is that woman playing a bicycle rim? Yes, Herbert. Ah yes, the space hippies episode. NERD Episiarch is from ancient Greek. It means “I banged your mom”. It’s Egyptian for “sofa”. It means over the rainbow. Yes, rainbow as in gay. But don’t fool yourself into thinking over means top. In this case, it just means flaming. Well, I am the gayest monster since gay came to Gaytown. “The Guardian has followed suit, forbidding “toxic commentary”” If you took the retard out of guardian comments, there would be nothing there. I posted an example of their “Report an offending-comment”-form a long while back (perhaps last summer). It is was a riot of 27B stroke 6 proportions. (it has since changed from a “tick the box of our offendedness menu” to an open “explain why you are reporting”) The way to deal with online vitriol is to confront it, not to suppress it. The basic fallacy here is that speech can ‘incite to violence’. Quite the opposite: suppressing speech or religion is often used as an excuse and justification for violence (which is what our founding fathers understood very well). Twitter and facebook are going completely the wrong way on this one – the same direction as Europe and it’s a witch hunt and will end about as well as can be expected for such things. God bless Murica! Well she’s certainly adorable. I would bump fire her. Geek alert. I made it halfway through and nobody is banging yet. Old refugee man with candy http://www.dailymail.co.uk/new…..onths.html He told police that he knew such an act was ‘forbidden in any country of the world’, and he was not ‘always sick’, as he has a wife and a daughter in Iraq. First thought: “asshole, leaving his family in Iraq” Second thought: “they probably don’t mind” Well at least he isn’t racist I’m going to pretend that the girl holding that sign just doesn’t know how to read English. for the record, the sign was photoshopped, but the image was distributed by people who actually preferred the ‘fake sentiment’ more. which is scarier? you decide. I’m gonna need a derp flow chart on that one Or possibly a Venn Diagram No indigenous psychotic pedophiles, I guess? So by his logic I just be justified putting a bullet through his skull due to built up anger. Or perhaps by any reasonable person logic. By contrast, governments are limited in their ability to curtail free speech, though where the state draws the lines is always a tricky endeavor. “Governments“, plural? Let’s never make the error of assuming that the liberties putatively enjoyed by Americans are somehow the default globally. It is not mere American exceptionalism to note that the rights citizens have when dealing with the police, say, are not recognized by any other 1st World Western country, much less anywhere else. I think this point is especially true re: the first amendment. people who think its somehow “old” and that the US should become more like the rest of their world in Speech Policing are a special combination of ‘dangerously ignorant & insane’. Viewpoint neutrality is unique. I wonder how long it’ll last. provoke violence “on the basis of ……. Thankfully, it’s a short list, so there’s still plenty of reasons you can provoke violence for. Like going slow in the left lane? “These are potentially expensive, unfair, and ineffective tactics for coping with online vitriol” No mention of lawyers? At what point is someone going to start sueing online companies for NOT censoring such speech. I’m not saying that’s their main reason for their petty bullshit but for some companies it may be. I’m thinking Paladin Press and Hit Man. Not saying anyone should be contrite in such matters but dealing with scum lawyers (or AGs) is not their business model. All it takes is one dickweed doing something fucked and claiming it’s because of some website they live on. “At what point is someone going to start sueing online companies for NOT censoring such speech.” I’m pretty sure Ken White has pointed out instances of this in the past. John Cleese – Political Correctness Can Lead to an Orwellian Nightmare “When does free speech become a legitimate threat of violence?” Apparently, when that speech is critical of da j00z. So has Brooklyn chosen to ignore the latest SCOTUS ruling on school segregation? “On Thursday, June 28, 2007 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the school systems in Seattle, WA and in Louisville, KY had violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment by their use of a student’s race in deciding whom to admit to particular public schools.” The 2007 ruling went away from Brown vs Board racial and ethnic group gropes to establish that individuals must be the primary consideration when enforcing the 14th amendment. Pushing school district boundaries around to obtain more group balance is a no-no. “Internet trollsNon-Progressives, be gone!” Fundamentally, Progressivism gets it power from it’s control of discourse – indoctrinating students from pre school to grad school, and running the media. To allow the peasants to speak their minds inevitably upsets the apple cart. The peasants don’t agree with them. And when the peasants *see* that other peasants don’t agree, then the jig is up. So, gotta ban comments. But it’s a conundrum on the internet. By limiting comments, they necessarily limit *engagement*, thereby interest and ultimately eyeballs. I expect individual content providers to swirl the drain if they limit engagement. The question is whether the big platform players like youtube, twitter and facebook can all be coopted to be their intellectual enforcers, and whether open competitors can spring up to take their business. But I see some hope. More like its obliteration of discourse. Somehow I suspect that conservatism and Christianity won’t afforded any such protection. If you ever lived in an area serviced by Ohio American Utilities Water Co., you would understand that private utilities can be just as crappy as the worst government ones. You still have no recourse, while paying higher rates, getting crappier water, and paying a CEO’s salary and dividends to Wall Street as a bonus. In the Columbus area, Columbus city water wins hands down.

""The shootings are a senseless act of violence that claimed the lives of innocent citizens and injured two others,"" Gov. Rick Snyder said in a released statement. ""We will lower the flags for six days to honor each of the six who died. Our hearts are broken for the victims' families and friends, and I join in mourning their loss."" The shootings occurred Saturday evening in three separate incidents, all allegedly by a suspect now in custody. The Michigan State Police, Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department and Kalamazoo Public Safety cooperated to locate the suspect, identified as Jason Brian Dalton. So far, police have identified four of the victims as Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda; Mary Jo Nye, 60, of Battle Creek; Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, of Battle Creek; and Barbara Hawthorne, 68, of Battle Creek. All were killed in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Kalamazoo. An unidentified 14-year-old girl with the group is critically injured. Police have not yet identified a father and son killed at the Seelye Ford Kia dealership in Kalamazoo, nor a woman who is hospitalized after being shot at Meadows Townhomes near Comstock. When flown at half-staff or half-mast, the U.S. flag should be hoisted first to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff or half-mast position. The flag should again be raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

366,http://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2016/02/how_an_iphone_passcode_has_foi.html,"Tim Cook In this Sept. 9, 2014, file photo, Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products in Cupertino, Calif. Faced with a federal judge's order to help investigators break into an iPhone allegedly used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters, Apple may well argue that the request would place an unreasonable burden on the company. In fact, doing what the government asks is not likely to be a tough technical feat for Apple. But doing so might have dramatic consequences on the data security of the millions of iPhone users around the world. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) (Marcio Jose Sanchez) Four numbers hardly seem like a foolproof way to protect a smartphone. But that's likely what has stumped federal law enforcement, who have been unable to break into the iPhone 5C used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. That has led to a standoff between Apple and the FBI over the agency's right to access the device's contents -- and its power to compel Apple to help it do so. Password-protecting an iPhone seemed unnecessary in the early smartphone days, when most devices contained little more than contacts and music. But as smartphones evolved into powerful mini-computers storing troves of personal, location and financial data, the need to safeguard them has soared. Phones today are better protected than they've ever been. ""You have to go out of your way to not have a passcode,"" said Eric Burger, director of the Georgetown University Center for Secure Communications. ""We're much better off."" The increased use of passwords may be keeping out hackers or jealous boyfriends, but now authorities are finding themselves locked out, too. The FBI's dilemma in the San Bernardino terror investigation has demonstrated how powerful these digital locks can be and could prompt more people to use them. ""The tools of the good guys have gotten a lot more powerful, stronger and with a lot more capability,"" Burger said. The problem is the tools are available to everyone, including terrorists. As smartphone theft blossomed worldwide, consumers were urged to turn on features enabling them to identify the real-time location of the phone and delete its contents over the Internet. Smartphone makers even require a passcode, at minimum, if users want to use their phones as mobile wallets that store digital copies of credit cards. ""It's your banking information, who you had lunch with, where you've been,"" Burger said. ""People are realizing criminals are using that information to clear out your bank account."" Apple added an extra layer of security in 2013 when it introduced Touch ID, a fingerprint scanner that allows users to unlock their phones by pressing their fingerprint to the home button. Last year, Apple upped its security even more and remains the toughest device for outsiders to penetrate. It increased the default passcode length to six characters from four, making them more difficult to crack. Apple also has deterred hackers from making multiple guesses. A security setting wipes an iPhone's data clean after 10 incorrect tries. That limit is what's stymieing FBI officials, who fear that if they keep trying to break into San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone 5C, they risk destroying all the content they're after. Other smartphone companies have touted their phones' security options in recent years. Samsung's Knox feature locks data under a separate password into a harder-to-access layer of the smartphone. Microsoft pitches a phone to business customers that gives corporate officials new powers to secure employees' devices. Cybersecurity experts applauded the efforts because in 2013 just 47 percent of U.S. adult Internet users locked their device in some fashion, according to a Consumer Reports survey. The numbers are much higher now, experts say. ""The real issue with security is still not so much about bits and bytes,"" Burger said. ""It's about how to make it easier for users to use and help them understand why it's important."" Law enforcement has found ways around smartphone passcodes. Courts have regularly ordered Apple to turn over iPhone user data backed up on the cloud. And law enforcement authorities can exploit loopholes in Google's Android operating system to access data on phones running that software. But ""Apple is highly unique in the way it limits access to the area of the phone where information is stored,"" said Michael Harris, chief marketing officer at Guidance Software, a forensic software vendor. That's what pushed the Silicon Valley giant to the center of the debate for a back door into smartphones. Apple should have the capability to develop one, experts said, but the company's history with guarding consumers' data from outside entities shows it's probably headed in a different direction.

A 14-year-old girl who was critically injured in a shooting that killed four others in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant was thought to have died until she squeezed her mother's hand, said First Lt. Dale Hinz of the Michigan State Police. Police initially had included her among the mass shooting fatalities for several hours early on Sunday, Feb. 21. Cracker Barrel was one of three shooting scenes that threw Kalamazoo County into chaos late Saturday and early Sunday as police tried to make sense of the seemingly random murder spree. Police arrested the suspect at Ransom and Porter streets on the north side of Kalamazoo at 12:40 a.m., said First Lt. Dale Hinz of the Michigan State Police. The man, whom police have said is a Kalamazoo resident in his 40s, was driving a black Chevrolet HHR. ""Suffice it to say there was other evidence that led us to believe he is our suspect,"" Hinz said. Police in a press conference said the suspect went quietly with police, and no officers were injured. A sheriff's deputy spotted the vehicle and pulled it over in a traffic stop. Chief Jeff Hadley of the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety said after the arrest, police did wonder if there were perhaps other victims since the acts were so random, but at this point they are unaware of any other people who were shot during the murder spree. ""It's totally unprovoked, random acts of violence. We're still trying to figure out the motives."" Authorities for several hours Saturday worked the multiple shooting scenes. The Michigan State Police, Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department and the Kalamazoo Public Safety Department worked together. Emily Monacelli is a reporter for MLive.com.

Obama on Kalamazoo Killings: 'Have to Do More' to Protect Innocent Americans — -- President Obama decried the latest mass shooting to strike in the United States, mourning for the Kalamazoo community that was “terrorized by gun violence” on Saturday. The president said he phoned the city’s mayor, Bobby Hopewell, this morning, as well as the sheriff and the police chief there, telling them “that they would have whatever federal support they needed in their investigation.” “Their local officials and first responders, by the way, did an outstanding job in apprehending the individual very quickly, but you got families who are shattered today,” Obama said. The president lamented that while he took executive action earlier this year to “make it harder for dangerous people” like the suspected Kalamazoo shooter to buy a gun, “clearly, we're going to  need to do more if we're going to keep innocent Americans safe.” “I have got to assume that all of you are just as tired as I am of seeing this stuff happen in your states,” Obama said, addressing the dozens of governors at the White House today who are in Washington for  the National Governors Association’s winter meeting. “That's an area where we also need to partner and think about what we can do in a common-sense way, in a bipartisan way, without some of the ideological rhetoric that so often surrounds that issue.” Get real-time updates as this story unfolds.

Jason Dalton Apparently Took Uber Fares While on an Alleged Rampage in Kalamazoo, Michigan — -- A teenager who was critically injured in a mass shooting in Kalamazoo, Michigan, has been upgraded to fair condition 10 days after being shot, according to the Bronson Methodist Hospital. Abigail Kopf, 14, was one of eight people in a series of shootings in Kalamazoo that left six dead. Suspected shooter Jason Dalton was arrested and charged with the murders. Abigail was gravely injured in the shootings and her heart even stopped due to her injuries, according to officials from Bronson Methodist Hospital. Doctors were initially concerned she might become brain dead, officials said. ""Following restoration of her heartbeat, our team shared with her parents the grave nature of her life-threatening injuries,"" Dr. Aaron Lane-Davies, medical director at Bronson Children’s Hospital, said in the statement last week. ""Due to both the nature of her injuries and efforts required to sustain her life, our team discussed the possibility that she could become brain dead."" The girl's injuries were so severe that Gift of Life, an organ and tissue donor organization, was contacted with the permission of Abigail's parents, but Abigail was never declared medically brain dead, according to the doctor. The teen had been at a concert with her family when she was injured. Her grandmother was killed in the shooting, authorities said. The family wrote on an online fundraising page today that Abigail's condition had greatly improved and that she was now in fair condition. The Bronson Methodist Hospital confirmed the teen was now in fair condition, but declined to give a more detailed explanation of how she was doing. ""Abigail, her parents and our team continue to fight hard for her life,"" Lane-Davies said last week, before the teen's condition was upgraded.

Terrorism Arrives in US: New Photo of San Bernardino Killers — -- More than two months after a jihadi couple opened fire at a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, killing 14 and wounding more than 20, the FBI has still not ruled out the possibility that a third militant was at the scene of the slaughter, officials told ABC News this week. In the immediate hours after the Dec. 2, 2015 shootings, some witnesses told law enforcement officers and reporters that they saw three gunmen at the center. But by the end of the day, the FBI had issued a statement saying there were only two confirmed shooters, local residents Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik. Farook worked with many of those he gunned down at the party. “What we have confirmed is evidence indicating that two weapons were fired at the Inland Regional Center,” Laura Eimiller, a spokesperson for the FBI Los Angeles, told ABC News this week.  “But in the absence of video it’s something you can’t entirely rule out until every question is answered. There’s still unanswered questions.” Some eyewitnesses including Sally Abdelmageed, who works at the center in San Bernardino, told the media back in December that she saw three attackers with black military attire and vests. When asked by ABC News this week about her previous comments, Abdelmageed said, “I know what I saw.” Lt. Mike Madden of the San Bernardino Police Department, who was the first officer to respond to the scene, said in an interview this week that calls came in from different places including from some who said they saw three gunmen. But he said he is skeptical of that now, since some witnesses may have seen one of the suspects more than once and thought there was a third person, when there was not. He said there was no evidence to point to a third person. Another Los Angeles law enforcement official said some witnesses may have confused first-responders for the terrorist couple, who had pledged loyalty to ISIS just before their savage attacks which ended with their deaths during a gunfight with police. Clearly, for now, the FBI is still operating under the assumption that there were two shooters as the investigation plays out to try and confirm that beyond any doubt. ""Initially the agents were looking for a driver because of those eyewitness reports of three gunmen,"" a counter-terrorism official involved in the investigation on the ground in San Bernardino told ABC News today. ""But one witness saw only two subjects get in the SUV and drive away,"" the official said. That witness's account was deemed more credible by the FBI than others inside the killing room because the person was not aware that a mass shooting had been perpetrated. ""They were not under high stress at the time because they didn't know what had just happened inside the center,"" the official said. ""The brain plays tricks on you under stress.” But the investigation is ongoing. Today the FBI announced it had executed a search warrant in Corona, Calif., apparently at the home of Farook’s brother. The FBI’s ability to find other links to the two shooters has been hindered by its inability so far to find the couple's desktop computer hard drive or unlock encrypted data on an Apple iPhone that belonged to one of the shooters, which could reveal more information about the planning of the attack. Allan Lengel is a journalist based in Detroit, Mich., a reporter for the law enforcement news website TickleTheWire.com and a contributor to ABC News. Editor's note: This report has been updated to reflect that it is unclear whether the search today of Farook's brother's home is directly related to the December shooting. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2016-02-18 14:01:13,FBI Hasn't Ruled Out 3rd Militant in San Bernardino Killings,murders and attempted murders,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

An Uber driver in Kalamazoo County in southwestern Michigan is in police custody after a spree of shootings in the area left six dead and two wounded. Police took the suspect, 45-year-old Jason Brian Dalton, into custody early Sunday in connection with the three shootings Saturday night, NBC News reported. Although the shootings appear to have been premeditated, police say the victims were seemingly chosen at random. ""There is no connection between any of them. This all appears to be random,"" Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said. ""This is the worst-case scenario that any community can have."" Police stopped Dalton around 12:45 am, seizing a semiautomatic handgun during the arrest. Law enforcement believe Dalton was planning on carrying out more shootings before he was stopped. The shootings are a devastating tragedy, but unfortunately one that Americans are increasingly familiar with. As more of these events end up in the news, the country is being forced to consider why the US, more than any other developed nation, suffers from such extraordinary levels of gun violence. And it seems easy access to firearms provide one answer.  According to police, there were three shootings in the Kalamazoo area on Saturday after 6 pm. Although there were no connections between the victims, Dalton seems to have premeditated the attacks, even though he apparently chose victims at random. Here are the events, as reported by NBC News, ABC News, the Detroit Free Press, and law enforcement: Michigan State Police identified several of the dead victims: Mary Lou Nye, 62; Mary Jo Nye, 60; Dorothy Brown, 74; and Barbara Hawthorne, 68. Local police reportedly told local news station WOOD TV that Dalton was an Uber driver, and he may have taken fares in between the shootings. Authorities are looking into a Facebook post by apparent Uber passengers who were in Dalton's vehicle as he reportedly drove erratically and sideswiped another car. Uber released a statement confirming Dalton was an Uber driver and that he had passed a background check, according to the Detroit Free Press. ""We are horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence in Kalamazoo, Michigan,"" Joe Sullivan, chief security officer at Uber, said in the statement. ""Our hearts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this devastating crime and those recovering from injuries. We are reaching out to the police to help with their investigation in any way that we can."" Mother Jones At least one of the shootings in Kalamazoo County counts as a mass shooting under any definition, since four people died in one event. And depending on which definition one uses for these events, it's possible that mass shootings overall could be on the rise. There's some debate about how to define mass shootings. But under one definition — shootings at a public place in which the shooter murdered four or more people, excluding domestic, gang, and drug violence — they appear to be getting more common, as the chart above from Mother Jones, based on an analysis from Harvard School of Public Health, shows. But not everyone agrees with this definition. Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, for example, defines mass shootings as any shooting in which at least four people were murdered. Under those terms, mass shootings don't appear to be increasing. Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health call that definition too broad, since it includes domestic, gang, and drug-related shootings that may not be considered mass shootings in layman's terms. Still, some definitions are even broader. Under the definition used by the Gun Violence Archive (and Vox's map), mass shootings are those in which four or more people are shot, not necessarily killed, excluding the shooter. Since these types of events haven't been well tracked over a long period of time, it's hard to know if they are on the rise. But the debate over which definition to use for mass shootings misses the broader problem with gun violence in America: Compared with other developed countries, the US has extraordinary levels of gun violence. Javier Zarracina/Vox No other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times Sweden's, and nearly 16 times Germany's, according to UN data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) What's more, there appears to be a correlation between America's high levels of gun violence and gun ownership, as this chart from Tewksbury Lab shows: Tewksbury Lab Research reviews by the Harvard School of Public Health's Injury Control Research Center have concluded that more gun ownership leads to more gun violence. Other factors, such as socioeconomic issues, contribute to violence, but guns are the one issue that makes America unique relative to other developed countries in comparable socioeconomic circumstances. Studies have found this at both the state and country level. Take, for instance, this chart, from a 2007 study by Harvard researchers, showing the correlation between statewide firearm homicide victimization rates and household gun ownership after controlling for robbery rates: A more recent study from 2013, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, reached similar conclusions: After controlling for multiple variables, the study found that a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level. This holds up around the world. As Vox's Zack Beauchamp explained, a breakthrough analysis in the 1990s by UC Berkeley's Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not, contrary to the old conventional wisdom, have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations. Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that's driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. ""A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,"" Zimring and Hawkins wrote. ""A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London."" How can the country address this? The research shows tightening existing gun control measures in the US would help. But as Harvard's David Hemenway told Vox's Dylan Matthews, it would likely take decades for the mild gun control measures proposed in the US to have a significant impact. ""It's all speculation,"" Hemenway said. ""I suspect it would take a while (decades) for the US to get down to gun violence levels of other developed countries because a) we have so many guns which are durable, and b) we have a gun culture — we tend to use guns more often in more situations than citizens of other developed countries.""  To have a more immediate impact, then, the US would have to find a way to quickly remove the number of guns in circulation. Other countries have actually done that: In Australia, after a 1996 mass shooting, lawmakers passed new restrictions on guns and imposed a mandatory buyback program that essentially confiscated people's guns, seizing at least 650,000 firearms. According to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers, Australia's firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent. Although it's hard to gauge how much of this was driven by the buyback program, researchers argue it likely played some role: ""First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates."" Still, similar policies would be difficult to pass in America, a nation in which gun culture and ownership are tremendously ingrained — notably, in the Second Amendment. And gun owners are backed by a powerful lobby: the National Rifle Association. Combined, these forces have stopped any serious gun legislation from passing at the federal level — although some states have passed new restrictions in the past few years. But given the research, America's policies and attitudes toward guns have clear, deadly costs — including, perhaps, more events like the Kalamazoo shooting.

Walton said that four people, including the gunman, are dead and 14 are wounded, 10 critically, after a series of shootings at an Excel Industries plant, its parking lot, and nearby streets, according to the Associated Press. The suspect was an employee at Excel Industries, which makes lawnmower parts, identified as 38-year-old Cedric Ford. A police officer shot and killed Ford, who reportedly had an assault weapon and pistol. The gunman apparently began shooting after county deputies served him a ""protection from abuse"" order, which are typically issued after violence in a relationship. The order was served around 3:30 pm local time, and the shooting began around 5 pm. The Kansas City Star reported that a woman who identified herself as Ford's live-in girlfriend accused him of verbal and physical abuse, prompting the protection order. Ford also had several convictions in Florida for burglary, grand theft, fleeing from an officer, aggravated fleeing, and carrying a concealed weapon, according to the AP. The shooting came less than a week after another mass shooting at Kalamazoo, Michigan. The shootings are a devastating tragedy, but unfortunately one that Americans are increasingly familiar with.

Yesterday’s shooting in Hesston, Kansas, that left three victims dead, not including the gunman, and 16 others wounded, some of them critically, didn't. Perhaps as a mere workplace plus another place plus a third place shooting, it's too pedestrian these days.

But maybe it's for the best that Republicans stop talking about our mass murders. We're learning more about the Kalamazoo, Michigan, mass murder—that would be the Uber driver who drove through the town killing people, if you're finding it hard to keep track—and it turns out that killer fits a familiar profile. A longtime, close friend of the Kalamazoo shooting spree suspect said Jason Dalton is a staunch Second Amendment supporter who feared that recent mass shootings could lead to gun control. “He was a gun enthusiast. He’s always been pro-Second Amendment,” Dalton’s friend, who asked not to be identified, told 24 Hour News 8 on Wednesday, providing some of the best insight so far into the suspected killer. So it seems the Kalamazoo mass murderer was in part influenced by the heavily promoted Republican theory that Obama was going to take all our precious guns and bullets away to stop mass murderers, so he had better buy more guns in case he needed to commit one. Perhaps we should thank the Republicans for not even mentioning mass murders anymore, given that. Anyway, there was another mass murder in America yesterday afternoon. As far as we know it wasn't by a Muslim man, but rest assured: if it was, we'd get right on that.",2016-02-26 12:31:59,Yesterday's mass shooting in Kansas didn't rate mention in the Republican presidential debate,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,homosexuality,murders and attempted murders",115,http://www.dailykos.com
381,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/wEjLDnkHNlw/,"After Apple’s lawyers revealed that the agency is trying to gain access to about a dozen devices, it’s becoming increasingly clear why the government chose to take the San Bernardino case public. James Comey, the director of the FBI, has insisted that his agency’s ongoing conflict with Apple over a terrorist’s phone is just that: a conflict over one phone. In a letter posted to the Lawfare blog over the weekend, Comey called the legal issue at hand “quite narrow,” and said the FBI sought only “limited” help. Experts say the small scope of the FBI’s ask bolsters its case. But in fact, the iPhone 5c that belonged to Syed Farook—one of the perpetrators of December’s mass shooting in San Bernadino, California—is only one of at least a dozen of Apple devices the FBI is seeking to access, according to court documents unsealed Tuesday. In a letter addressed to a federal judge in New York, a lawyer for Apple said that federal law enforcement has recently requested that the company access information on 12 other iOS devices. The list is likely not a complete tally of the FBI’s requests, and does not include similar requests from state or local police. The letter was sent last week, just one day after a federal judge in California asked Apple to help the FBI unlock Farook’s iPhone. It was filed under seal but was released on Tuesday. The letter was submitted to a federal court in Brooklyn, where Apple and the FBI are facing off in a less dramatic version of the San Bernardino legal fight. In the Brooklyn case, the FBI is asking Apple to extract data from a locked iPhone with an outdated operating system. In San Bernardino, the FBI is asking Apple to modify the software in a newer iPhone in order to make it easier for agents to try to break in. Apple can technically fulfill both requests, but it has chosen to oppose them. All 12 requests outlined in the letter were made under the All Writs Act, a 1789 law which has been used to compel a landline phone service provider to help the FBI conduct phone taps. But the judge in the Brooklyn case has expressed doubt that the same law would apply to locked iPhones. Here’s why this all matters: These 12 pending requests—and probably many more that didn’t make the list—are a logjam waiting to break. If the federal judge in the San Bernardino case sides with the FBI, it would be much easier for the judges overseeing these other, similar cases to compel Apple to comply. Apple maintains that this case is not, in fact, about just one phone; it’s about precedent. And if it can show that the government is using the San Bernardino case as a way to break through at least a dozen stalled cases elsewhere (even as the FBI claims that it’s not interested in setting a precedent), the judge might think twice before granting the FBI’s wishes. Meanwhile, there are a whole lot more devices waiting in the wings, in the hands of state and local law enforcement. The Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. says he’s asked Apple to unlock a whopping 175 iPhones. If the government wins in San Bernardino, Vance told PBS’s Charlie Rose recently, he would “absolutely” try to get Apple to help get data off those devices, too. It’s likely the government chose to take the San Bernardino case public, instead of one of the other pending cases, because it can make a very strong argument for needing to get into a terrorist’s iPhone. Comey wrote compellingly in his recent open letter that the FBI is duty-bound to pursue every lead in a national-security investigation. Here, Apple is forced to take a position that obstructs a crucial-seeming probe, in contrast to the other cases, which did not involve terrorism charges, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The FBI may be winning the public-relations battle it’s fighting with Apple alongside the ongoing legal conflicts. According to a poll that Pew Research conducted over the weekend, most Americans think Apple should honor the FBI’s request to unlock Farook’s iPhone. But now, Apple has a new arrow in its quiver: It can show that helping the FBI in California will have far-reaching consequences.",2016-02-23 13:13:26,Apple Is Right: The FBI Wants to Break into Lots of Phones,"computers and the internet,terrorism,crime and criminals,telephones and telecommunications,cellular telephones",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

She is the author/illustrator of the children’s books On the Loose in Boston, On the Loose in Washington, D.C., and On the Loose in Philadelphia, and of the graphic novel Starling, which is serialized at GoComics.com.  With the Granite State’s nominating contest once again approaching, and 
some people—as in past years—questioning why its primary deserves to come first (Reince Priebus, chairman of the RNC, recently expressed interest in instituting ""a rotating primary process"" or a ""random lottery""), this 2012 cartoon still seems applicable four years later:   This week, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued a recommendation that women be screened for depression both during pregnancy and after giving birth, as approximately one in seven new mothers are thought to experience depressive symptoms. If anything is going to make a person depressed, the discombobulation of new motherhood would certainly do it (as this cartoonist can attest.) The multi-paneled cartoon below—attempting a somewhat lighter spin on the experience—first appeared in 2014 and became one of most widely shared from Sage, Ink. (A year later, the publication of a study revealing the extreme toll that new parenthood takes on happiness prompted a followup cartoon.)    This week, the federal government released a new set of dietary guidelines, recommending a significant reduction in the consumption of sugar and advising men and teen boys to cut back on meat. While the hope is that the recommendations will help Americans to eat better, some note that the government has been fine-tuning and updating its dietary advice for years, while obesity rates have escalated. (Meanwhile, some are already criticizing the new guidelines as too vague.) The cartoon below originally appeared in 2004, when the USDA issued a call for improvements to the then-prevailing “Food Guide Pyramid.”  Hillary Clinton’s bathroom break during Saturday’s Democratic debate captured the attention of Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, this week. During a speech in Michigan, Trump said her trip to the bathroom was too “disgusting” to talk about and said she was “schlonged” by Barack Obama in the 2008 primary. The Donald has been known to make controversial comments, so it’s only appropriate that the year would end with at least one more—this time targeted at the Democratic frontrunner. This week, the Department of Homeland Security announced changes to its terror alert system, adding a new category of general “bulletins” to its existing program of specific “alerts.” How helpful Americans will find it remains to be seen, but it’s unlikely to be considered more confusing than the old color-calibrated system, which was discontinued in November 2010. The cartoon below ran in 2002, when the then-new color alert system got its first adjustment to orange from yellow.   Getting COVID-19 when you’re vaccinated isn’t the same as getting COVID-19 when you’re unvaccinated. A new dichotomy has begun dogging the pandemic discourse. With the rise of the über-transmissible Delta variant, experts are saying you’re either going to get vaccinated, or going to get the coronavirus. For some people—a decent number of us, actually—it’s going to be both. Coronavirus infections are happening among vaccinated people. They’re going to keep happening as long as the virus is with us, and we’re nowhere close to beating it. When a virus has so thoroughly infiltrated the human population, post-vaccination infections become an arithmetic inevitability. As much as we’d like to think otherwise, being vaccinated does not mean being done with SARS-CoV-2. Post-vaccination infections, or breakthroughs, might occasionally turn symptomatic, but they aren’t shameful or aberrant. They also aren’t proof that the shots are failing. These cases are, on average, gentler and less symptomatic; faster-resolving, with less virus lingering—and, it appears, less likely to pass the pathogen on. The immunity offered by vaccines works in iterations and gradations, not absolutes. It does not make a person completely impervious to infection. It also does not evaporate when a few microbes breach a body’s barriers. A breakthrough, despite what it might seem, does not cause our defenses to crumble or even break; it does not erase the protection that’s already been built. Rather than setting up fragile and penetrable shields, vaccines reinforce the defenses we already have, so that we can encounter the virus safely and potentially build further upon that protection. Many queer people are reimagining their own boundaries and thinking of this reentry period as a time for sexual self-discovery. The pandemic has affected our sex lives in many unusual ways, but perhaps none more unusual than this development: The coronavirus has highlighted the possible public-health benefits of glory holes. Sexual positions that make use of walls as physical barriers have long been considered niche. But when the New York City Department of Health recommended them last month as part of a push for safer sex, it tapped into a question that many of us have been asking—How do you seek sexual satisfaction during a global health crisis? I haven’t had sex in more than a year, mostly because I took COVID-19 very seriously. I disconnected from the public sphere. No one visited my apartment. I disinfected my groceries and covered my apartment’s air vents with trash bags. As a queer person, I could barely register the idea of sex while living alongside a deadly virus that nobody really understood. One study published early in the pandemic showed that 43.5 percent of people reported a decrease in the quality of their sex life. Among study participants, they had fewer sexual encounters with other people, and even masturbated less often. Gather friends and feed them, laugh in the face of calamity, and cut out all the things––people, jobs, body parts––that no longer serve you. “The only thing a uterus is good for after a certain point is causing pain and killing you. Why are we even talking about this?” Nora jams a fork into her chopped chicken salad, the one she insisted I order as well. “If your doctor says it needs to come out, yank it out.” Nora speaks her mind the way others breathe: an involuntary reflex, not a choice. (Obviously, all dialogue here, including my own, is recorded from the distortion field of memory.) “But the uterus …” I say, spearing a slice of egg. “It’s so …” “Symbolic?” “Yes. Don’t roll your eyes.” “I’m not rolling my eyes.” She leans in. “I’m trying to get you to face a, well, it’s not even a hard truth. It’s an easy one. Promise me the minute you leave this lunch you’ll pick up the phone and schedule the hysterectomy today. Not tomorrow. Today.” I carried on for more than a year of the coronavirus pandemic, but I didn’t see the next plague coming. After the end of the world, there will be birdsong. I used to imagine this when everything was going awry. I would lie in bed in my college dorm room and listen to the lone mockingbird who sang all night outside my window in the spring months. I was worried about something or other; he was getting on with things. It’s what birds do. They have a knack for it. In the Book of Genesis, after the devastation of the Earth by God’s cataclysmic flood, Noah releases from his ark a dove; he knows that the trial has ended when the bird does not return, having alighted somewhere out in the damp and dreary world, the first land-dwelling creature to begin the work of carrying on. What else is there to do? When COVID-19 began to spread in the United States, late in the winter of 2020, I told myself as much. In plagues, as in life, there is a morally arbitrary hierarchy of luck, and it didn’t take long for me to realize that my family and I were among the lucky ones. I was in my late 20s, hale and hearty, my husband the same plus a couple of years. Our children were young—our baby was, in fact, under a year old, something I eventually mentioned in a meekly anxious aside to a doctor I was interviewing for a story on the emerging pandemic. He acknowledged certain risks in the way that doctors do, and then said: “Don’t worry. Kids are kicking ass with this thing.” I was both comforted and chastened; this wasn’t mine to panic about. The best I could do for those in peril was to carry on. In the United States, this pandemic could be almost over by now. The reasons it’s still going are pretty clear. In the United States, this pandemic could’ve been over by now, and certainly would’ve been by Labor Day. If the pace of vaccination through the summer had been anything like the pace in April and May, the country would be nearing herd immunity. With most adults immunized, new and more infectious coronavirus variants would have nowhere to spread. Life could return nearly to normal. Experts list many reasons for the vaccine slump, but one big reason stands out: vaccine resistance among conservative, evangelical, and rural Americans. Pro-Trump America has decided that vaccine refusal is a statement of identity and a test of loyalty. In April, people in counties that Joe Biden won in 2020 were two points more likely to be fully vaccinated than people in counties that Donald Trump won: 22.8 percent were fully vaccinated in Biden counties; 20.6 percent were fully vaccinated in Trump counties. By early July, the vaccination gap had widened to almost 12 points: 46.7 percent were fully vaccinated in Biden counties, 35 percent in Trump counties. When pollsters ask about vaccine intentions, they record a 30-point gap: 88 percent of Democrats, but only 54 percent of Republicans, want to be vaccinated as soon as possible. All told, Trump support predicts a state’s vaccine refusal better than average income or education level. They’re not all anti-vaxxers, and treating them as such is making things worse. Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said that COVID-19 is “becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.” President Joe Biden said much the same shortly after. They are technically correct. Even against the fast-spreading Delta variant, the vaccines remain highly effective, and people who haven’t received them are falling sick far more often than those who have. But their vulnerability to COVID-19 is the only thing that unvaccinated people universally share. They are disparate in almost every way that matters, including why they haven’t yet been vaccinated and what it might take to persuade them. “‘The unvaccinated’ are not a monolith of defectors,” Rhea Boyd, a pediatrician and public-health advocate in the San Francisco Bay Area, tweeted on Saturday. The once-dynamic state is closing the door on economic opportunity. Behold California, colossus of the West Coast: the most populous American state; the world’s fifth-largest economy; and arguably the most culturally influential, exporting Google searches and Instagram feeds and iPhones and Teslas and Netflix Originals and kimchi quesadillas. This place inspires awe. If I close my eyes I can see silhouettes of Joshua trees against a desert sunrise; seals playing in La Jolla’s craggy coves of sun-spangled, emerald seawater; fog rolling over the rugged Sonoma County coast at sunset into primeval groves of redwoods that John Steinbeck called “ambassadors from another time.” This landscape is bejeweled with engineering feats: the California Aqueduct; the Golden Gate Bridge; and the ribbon of Pacific Coast Highway that stretches south of Monterey, clings to the cliffs of Big Sur, and descends the kelp-strewn Central Coast, where William Hearst built his Xanadu on a hillside where his zebras still graze. No dreamscape better inspires dreamers. Millions still immigrate to my beloved home to improve both their prospects and ours. Robinhood traders have earned the most attention, but they’re only part of a larger story about class stagnation and distrust. On a Wednesday in June, deep in a corner of the Reddit message board r/WallstreetBets, a user going by Your_Boy_Roy_ published a lengthy post. The subreddit, which now has almost 11 million members (or “Degenerates,” as the page officially lists them), has become an epicenter for crowdsourced, short-term, high-risk stock speculation and analysis. Roy had been a member of the group since “its prime,” and had to get something off his chest. “You are all being ridiculous with these endless posts,” he titled his spiel. The subreddit, he wrote, was facing an epidemic of “I made $368 on my BIG DICK YOLO PLAY” entries: overeager, ill-informed, low-stakes-masquerading-as-high-stakes material that he deemed in violation of the forum’s typically brash-yet-chipper atmosphere. A new generation of Latino Protestants is poised to transform our religious and political landscapes. In 2007, when Obe and Jacqueline Arellano were in their mid-20s, they moved from the suburbs of Chicago to Aurora, Illinois, with the dream of starting a church. They chose Aurora, a midsize city with about 200,000 residents, mostly because about 40 percent of its population is Latino. Obe, a first-generation Mexican American pastor, told me, “We sensed God wanted us there.” By 2010, the couple had “planted a church,” the Protestant term for starting a brand-new congregation. This summer, the Arellanos moved to Long Beach, California, to pastor at Light & Life Christian Fellowship, which has planted 20 churches in 20 years. Their story is at once singular and representative of national trends: Across the United States, more Latino pastors are founding churches than ever before, a trend that challenges conventional views of evangelicalism and could have massive implications for the future of American politics. What are we going to do about it? This article was published online on July 26, 2021. One afternoon, during my freshman year at Alabama A&M University, my homework was piling up, and I was feeling antsy. I needed a change of scenery from Foster Hall. I’d heard that the library at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, 10 minutes away, was open three hours longer than our own. So I loaded up my backpack, ran down the stairs—the dorm’s elevator was busted—and headed across town. Founded in 1875 to educate Black students who had been shut out of American higher education, A&M was a second home for me. My mom had gone there; my uncle had been a drum major in the ’80s; my sister was on the volleyball team. But when you’re home long enough, you start to notice flaws: The classroom heaters were always breaking down, and the campus shuttle never seemed to run on time when it was coldest out. When I arrived at UAH, I was shocked. The buildings looked new, and fountains burst from man-made ponds. The library had books and magazines I’d never heard of—including the one for which I now write. Getting COVID-19 when you’re vaccinated isn’t the same as getting COVID-19 when you’re unvaccinated.

383,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/BvL3npu5TDc/,"A lawsuit brought by families of victims blames the marketing of military-style guns to civilians. More than 14 months after victims’ families sued Bushmaster Firearms in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, the lawsuit is finally approaching the first critical test of a novel liability claim: Whether or not the riflemaker can be held responsible for the Sandy Hook massacre because of how it has marketed a military-style weapon to civilians. The case was filed by relatives of nine of the 26 children and adults Adam Lanza killed with a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle. Bushmaster argues that the suit is barred under the decade-old federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which shields the gun industry from liability claims. A Connecticut state judge has scheduled a hearing for February 22 on the defendants’ motions to dismiss. If the case survives this round—hardly a given, considering the difficulties other plaintiffs have encountered in trying to break through PLCAA’s immunity shield—the lawsuit would then head into uncharted territory, as the Newtown plaintiffs seek to use the industry’s marketing tactics against it. Those tactics, never tested before under PLCAA, dominate the allegations spelled out in the plaintiffs’ complaint. It quotes several advertisements from a catalog aimed at civilian gun buyers that is adorned with action photos of camouflage-clad soldiers and police in body armor. One reads, “Forces of opposition, bow down. You are single-handedly outnumbered.” Other images tout the rifle’s “military-proven performance” and call it “the ultimate combat weapons system.” With that type of marketing, the Sandy Hook families claim, “The Bushmaster Defendants attract buyers by extolling the militaristic and assaultive qualities of their AR-15 rifles.” The complaint alleges that while the weapon is suitable for the military and for law enforcement—where it’s used for combat and limited police purposes—in civilian hands, the high-caliber, rapid-fire rifles are essentially killing machines. One law professor sees those claims as having some chance of success—if not in court then at least in shaping public opinion. John Culhane of Widener University’s Delaware Law School, a longtime advocate for using litigation to reform gun-industry practices, says the plaintiffs deserve points for creativity by trying to find a way around PLCAA through an attack on the industry’s selling of tactical firearms to civilians. “It’s a long shot,” Culhane concedes, but the plaintiffs’ argument holds powerful potential if the suit manages to reveal the thinking behind the riflemaker’s marketing strategy for the military-grade firearms. Positioning the case as a contest between commercial exploitation and parents mourning murdered children puts enormous pressure on the industry, he says. That pressure might be compounded by the enormous expansion of the tactical weapons and accessories market, which industry watchers believe is a chief engine of growth in the gun business. That’s largely due to the success of the AR-15, the semi-automatic civilian version of the U.S. military’s automatic M-16 rifle. The weapon is designed for endless tinkering, and has proven especially popular with young buyers more attuned to owning guns as a social pursuit, in contrast with more traditional markets in hunting and self-defense. But the marketing-to-civilians argument can cut both ways. As Frank Miniter pointed out in the National Rifle Association magazine America’s 1st Freedom, the millions of civilian sales of AR-15s are evidence that the so-called “black rifle” has been embraced by the general public mainly without incident, a fact that would seem to undercut the Newtown plaintiff’s claim that the AR-15’s true utility is confined to criminal mayhem. The Newtown lawsuit’s tug-of-war serves as a kind of replay of the debate that led to Congress’ passage of PLCAA in the first place. Congress was prompted to pass the law by industry complaints that the firearms business might be sued out of existence by innovative legal attacks, brought at the time mostly by cities seeking to hold manufacturers or retailers liable for the costs of gun violence. PLCAA was meant to shut down those sorts of claims, which branded guns as a public nuisance under tort law, while preserving more traditional liability claims, says Georgia State law professor Timothy Lytton, who studies gun litigation. One of those traditional theories that received protection under the statute—“probably the oldest theory in this litigation,” Lytton says—is called negligent entrustment: when a seller fails to make reasonable attempts to keep a gun out of the wrong hands. “The standard example of that,” Lytton says, “is handing a loaded firearm to a child or a visibly deranged person.” Negligent entrustment was the central claim in the only gun-liability lawsuit to win a jury verdict since PLCAA’s passage. In that case, which was decided last October, a jury awarded nearly $6 million to two police officers who were seriously injured with a handgun that a gun shop in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, sold to an obvious straw buyer in 2009. No other negligent entrustment claim has made it that far under PLCAA, even when plaintiffs presented evidence that gun retailers knowingly sold guns to criminals or suicidal people. In a 2013 Missouri court decision, an Overland Park, Kansas, gun shop called The Bullet Hole won dismissal of a case where a man bought ammunition using a stolen credit card that he took from the neighbor he murdered, before going on a shooting spree in Kanas City. In another case, a gun shop in Odessa, Missouri, won dismissal of a negligent entrustment claim even though the family of a woman who committed suicide with a newly purchased gun had warned the store not to sell to her. The string of dismissed cases makes the Newtown claim look all the more uncertain, since the negligent entrustment it alleges—that the marketing itself constitutes entrusting the weapons to the general public in an illegal manner—is far removed from any kind of dubious, one-on-one sale. As Bushmaster’s lawyers point out, the AR-15 that Lanza used to kill his victims at Sandy Hook was purchased legally by his mother more than two years before the shootings, according to the state’s investigation of the December 2012 massacre. It’s another claim made by the plaintiffs’ lawyers that gives them at least a fighting chance, says Delaware Law School’s Culhane. This second argument also focuses on Bushmaster’s marketing. But it cites the marketing as a violation of Connecticut’s unfair trade practices act, which regulates irresponsible advertising. The advertising is deceptive and a violation of that state law, the plaintiffs argue, because it uses military imagery to entice the wrong sorts of consumers—civilians—to buy the product and then harm others with it. That’s a fairly standard sort of deceptive advertising claim, Culhane says, regardless of whether it’s blocked by PLCAA or whether there’s any evidence that Lanza or his mother were influenced by Bushmaster ads. It’s common to hold manufacturers liable when “there’s such a mismatch between the marketing of the product and its reasonable use,” he says. “If you market them as military style weapons, you’re going to attract a certain class of consumer, perhaps, that will act on this information.” A defendant isn’t protected under PLCAA if a plaintiff can prove a violation of an existing statute “applicable to the sale or marketing of guns,” as the law reads. The defense argues that means a gun-specific regulation, not a general statute like Connecticut’s advertising law. The Sandy Hook plaintiffs’ attempts to evade PLCAA’s gun industry shield amount to an end-run around the law’s meaning, Bushmaster’s lawyers argue in court papers. They accuse the plaintiffs of applying “expansive and unrecognized” interpretations to PLCAA to mask the reality that they are pursuing the same sorts of claims that the law was designed to block. If the plaintiffs’ arguments prevail, the defense team states, their rationale “would swallow the statute’s overall purpose—to protect firearms sellers from claims arising from the criminal use of lawfully sold firearms.” Those will be tough arguments to overcome, Culhane says. But one factor weighing in the plaintiffs’ favor is the fact that they managed to keep the case in state court, after spending much of last year beating back the defense’s insistence to try the case in the federal system. While it’s common for a federal judge to interpret state law, or for a state judge to interpret federal law, the plaintiffs stand to gain by having Connecticut courts deciding how Connecticut’s deceptive trade practices law applies in this case, Culhane says. “Their interpretation of the reach of that statute would be the last word, potentially.” If the Superior Court in Bridgeport, Connecticut rejects the defense’s motion to dismiss, then the case moves to the discovery phase, when the defense must turn over internal documents and expose executives to sworn interrogations. If that happens, Bushmaster has much to lose—even if the court later grants the defense a summary judgment or a jury finds in the gun company’s favor. Just entering discovery means the possibility that industry secrets will be brought to light. Thanks to discovery in past cases, notes Lytton, “we know more about industry ideas and attitudes towards distribution and gun tracing than we did before.” In the Badger Guns case, for instance, Lytton points out that discovery turned up evidence of “extremely sloppy controls” over gun sales at the store. As a result, he says, “We know what abuses look like in a specific instance,” which helps lay the groundwork for future claims. Judging from the towering pile of pleadings already generated in the case while it kicked around federal court, the lawsuit promises a legal slugfest for as long as it goes on. But it features a mismatch in gun-litigation experience, pitting the defense team’s James Vogts, a Chicago, Illinois lawyer with a long list of gun cases to his credit—including the recent Badger Guns case—against the plaintiffs’ Bridgeport firm of Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, which is better known for representing the singer Michael Jackson’s family against his concert promoter and for a string of high-dollar medical-malpractice and personal injury cases. That specialty, in fact, was the firm’s introduction to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs, when it represented some of the same families in a lawsuit to collect damages from Nancy Lanza’s homeowner’s insurance policy by claiming it was liable for her carelessness in making multiple guns accessible to her troubled son. The case settled last December for $1.5 million. The city of Bridgeport itself is no newcomer to the issues in the Bushmaster suit. It was among those that sued the gun industry in the 1990s, in the wave of litigation that led to Congress’ passage of PLCAA. Among the city’s claims: Manufacturers and retailers violated Connecticut’s unfair trade practices act with advertising that falsely portrayed guns as a public-safety tool. In 2001, the state’s high court tossed that lawsuit on grounds that the city lacked legal standing to bring the case. By then, the lead defendant, Smith & Wesson, had settled that and other cases, drawing scorn from its allies. One of the strongest denunciations came from the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), a gun-industry trade group, which accused Smith & Wesson of having “violated a trust with their customers and with the entire firearms industry” by surrendering. NSSF issued the statement from its office in Newtown, Connecticut.

The suspect, identified as Cedric Ford, 38, was armed with a .223-caliber assault-style rifle and a pistol as he fired randomly at coworkers and others over about 30 minutes on Thursday. He was killed in an exchange of gunfire with the first police officer to reach the scene, Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, police secretary Jeannine Hoheisel said. Hesston is a town of about 4,000 people about 36 miles north of Wichita, Hoheisel said. ""The man was not going to stop shooting,"" Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said at a news conference on Friday, noting that there were up to 300 people in the Excel Industries factory where the worst of the rampage took place. ""The only reason he stopped shooting is because that officer stopped the shooter."" Ford had been served a protection from abuse order earlier Thursday at the factory, which may have triggered the bloodshed, authorities said. He left the factory after being served but began shooting about 90 minutes later. The order, posted by the Wichita Eagle on its web site, was sought by an unidentified woman who had been living with Ford and said he had been physically abusive. She wrote in the order that he was alcoholic, violent, depressed and in need of medical and psychological help. Ford had been jailed a couple of times before, Walton said. Police identified the victims as Renee Benjamin, 30; Josh Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 40, according to the KWCH television station. The shooting began with Ford firing out of his vehicle as he drove through two cities back to the factory, Walton has said. He stole one victim's car, went to Excel Industries and shot someone in the parking lot before going inside. Law enforcement officials were checking to see if the firearms were legally purchased. All 14 wounded victims remain at hospitals and at least five were initially listed in critical condition. The attack follows a mass shooting in Michigan last weekend, when a driver for car-hailing service Uber [UBER.UL] killed six people. President Barack Obama, at an event in Jacksonville, Florida, expressed exasperation with the U.S. Congress' failure to act on gun violence issues. ""The real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine,"" he said. The number of mass shootings in the United States has elevated gun control as a campaign issue in the November U.S. presidential election.

385,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/piDOYSD_5Us/,"Authorities in Kansas were investigating on Friday the motives of a gunman who killed three people and wounded 14 during a shooting spree that ended when an officer killed the suspect at the factory where he worked. Law enforcement in Hesston, a town of about 3,800 people, have said Thursday's mass killing was not terror related. ""This is a horrible situation my friends, just terrible,” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said at a late evening press conference. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual,"" he said, without elaborating. While many of his victims were coworkers, the attacker appears to have opened fire at random, Walton said. Five of the 14 wounded were in critical condition. The Kansas killings follow a mass shooting in Michigan this weekend, when a driver for car-hailing service Uber killed six people. The escalating number of mass shootings in the United States have elevated gun control as a campaign issue in the November U.S. presidential election. The Kansas attacker, who was armed with a .223-caliber assault-style rifle and a pistol, fired out of his vehicle as he drove through two cities, Walton said. He then stole the car of one victim and drove to Excel Industries, where he worked, and shot a person in the parking lot. The gunman entered the plant, where he had been scheduled to work and where over 100 employees were beginning the day's second shift, and opened fire on his co-workers, killing three, the sheriff said. Other employees fled in panic. The first police officer on the scene exchanged fire with the gunman near the building's paint room, killing him, Walton said. ""Even though (the officer) took fire, he went inside of that place and saved multiple, multiple lives -- a hero, as far as I’m concerned,"" the sheriff said. The killing spree spanned 26 minutes, he said. A dispatcher with the Sheriff's Department had identified the shooter as 38-year-old Cedric Ford. Walton declined to identify the suspect, saying his identity would likely be released on Friday.

386,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/NwsrOZ9fVuk/,"Apple Inc will likely seek to invoke the United States' protections of free speech as one of its key legal arguments in trying to block an order to help unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, lawyers with expertise in the subject said this week. The tech giant and the Obama administration are on track for a major collision over computer security and encryption after a federal magistrate judge in Los Angeles handed down an order on Tuesday requiring Apple to provide specific software and technical assistance to investigators. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called the request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation unprecedented. Other tech giants such as Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google have rallied to support Apple. Apple has retained two prominent, free-speech lawyers to do battle with the government, according to court papers: Theodore Olson, who won the political-speech case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010, and Theodore Boutrous, who frequently represents media organizations. Government lawyers from the U.S. Justice Department have defended their request in court papers by citing various authorities, such as a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld an order compelling a telephone company to provide assistance with setting up a device to record telephone numbers. The high court said then that the All Writs Act, a law from 1789, authorized the order, and the scope of that ruling is expected to be a main target of Apple when it files a response in court by early next week. But Apple will likely also broaden its challenge to include the First Amendment's guarantee of speech rights, according to lawyers who are not involved in the dispute but who are following it. Compared with other countries, the United States has a strong guarantee of speech rights even for corporations, and at least one court has ruled that computer code is a form of speech, although that ruling was later voided. Apple could argue that being required to create and provide specific computer code amounts to unlawful compelled speech, said Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society. The order against Apple is novel because it compels the company to create a new forensic tool to use, not just turn over information in Apple's possession, Pfefferkorn said. ""I think there is a significant First Amendment concern,"" she said. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles declined to comment on the possible free-speech questions on Thursday. A speech-rights argument from Apple, though, could be met with skepticism by the courts because computer code has become ubiquitous and underpins much of the U.S. economy. ""That is an argument of enormous breadth,"" said Stuart Benjamin, a Duke University law professor who writes about the First Amendment. He said Apple would need to show that the computer code conveyed a ""substantive message."" In a case brought by a mathematician against U.S. export controls, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California, found in 1999 that the source code behind encryption software is protected speech. The opinion was later withdrawn so the full court could rehear the case, but that rehearing was canceled and the appeal declared moot after the government revised its export controls. The FBI and prosecutors are seeking Apple's assistance to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the San Bernardino shootings that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others at a holiday party. U.S. prosecutors were smart to pick the mass shooting as a test case for an encryption fight with tech companies, said Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor. That is because the shooting had a large emotional impact while also demonstrating the danger posed by armed militants, he said. In addition, the iPhone in dispute was owned not by Farook but by his employer, a local government, which has consented to the search of the iPhone. The federal magistrate who issued the order, Sheri Pym, is also a former federal prosecutor. ""This is one of the worst set of facts possible for Apple. That's why the government picked this case,"" Froomkin said. Froomkin added, though, that the fight was enormously important for the company because of the possibility that a new forensic tool could be easily used on other phones and the damage that could be done to Apple's global brand if it cannot withstand government demands on privacy. ""All these demands make their phones less attractive to users,"" he said.

387,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/WPh2PoGaTbc/,"A 94-year-old former SS guard went on trial Thursday for complicity in the murders of 170,000 people at Auschwitz, with the hearing opening with a survivor's harrowing testimony. More than seven decades after the end of World War II, Reinhold Hanning appeared in court in the western town of Detmold to face charges over his role at the notorious death camp in occupied Poland. The trial is the first of three scheduled this year against former SS men, as Germany races to prosecute ageing Third Reich criminals. Dressed in a tweed suit, the white-haired, bespectacled widower, who owned a dairy store after the war, kept his eyes trained on the table in front of him during the hearing, and left his lawyer to answer the judge's questions. Hanning planned to listen to what the witnesses had to say before deciding if he should take the stand, his lawyer told AFP. One of them, Leon Schwarzbaum, 90, pleaded with Hanning to tell the truth. ""We are almost the same age. We'll both face our highest judge soon,"" he told the defendant, urging him to explain why 35 members of his family ""and millions of Jews, Roma and others"" had to be killed. Schwarzbaum also recounted the starvation and constant fear of dying that plagued Auschwitz prisoners. Those who sought to escape were killed by dogs and their bodies left as a warning to others, he said, adding that regular executions and the endless stream of people sent to the gas chambers sowed terror. ""I was constantly afraid of dying from hunger or being selected (for the gas chamber),"" he told the court. The survivor, who was sent to Auschwitz when he was 22 years old, said: ""I still dream of it often."" - 'Failures of justice system' - Hanning stands accused of having watched over the selection of which prisoners were fit for labour, and which should be sent to gas chambers. He is also deemed to have been aware of the regular mass shooting of inmates at the camp, as well as the systematic starvation of prisoners. ""Through his capacity as a guard, he facilitated... the several thousand killings of inmates by the main perpetrator,"" prosecutors said. Hanning has admitted to working in Auschwitz but denies a role in the killings. He faces between three and 15 years in jail, but in view of his advanced age and the period required for any appeals, he is unlikely to serve time. But Christoph Heubner, vice president of the International Auschwitz Committee representing victims, said the trial was an opportunity to make up ""for the failures of Germany's justice system"". Among the 6,500 former SS personnel at Auschwitz who survived the war, fewer than 50 have been convicted. Holocaust survivor Angela Orosz, who will also testify against Hanning, told AFP that ""without these people and their active support for the Holocaust, what happened in Auschwitz, the murder of 1.1 million people in just a few years, would not have been possible."" Due to the strong interest in the trial, Thursday's hearing was held at Detmold's chamber of commerce, which can hold more people. A blue banner reading ""Let's not forget"" was also draped outside. - Last chance to speak out - For many survivors, the trial was also one of the last opportunity to ""speak before a German court,"" said chief judge Anke Grudda, before giving Schwarzbaum the floor. Two other survivors will follow on Friday. Thursday's trial came on the heels of last year's high-profile case against Oskar Groening, dubbed the ""Bookkeeper of Auschwitz"". Groening was sentenced in July to four years in prison, even though he had previously been cleared by German authorities after lengthy criminal probes dating back to the 1970s. But the legal foundation for prosecuting ex-Nazis changed in 2011 with the German conviction of former death camp guard John Demjanjuk, solely on the basis of his having worked at the Sobibor camp in occupied Poland. At least two other cases are due to be heard this year before German courts. One of them concerns former SS medic, Hubert Zafke, 95, who is charged with at least 3,681 counts of complicity in killings. Zafke was a medical orderly at the camp in a period when 14 trains carrying prisoners -- including the Jewish teenage diarist Anne Frank -- arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Another former guard at Auschwitz, 93-year-old Ernst Remmel, is set to stand trial in April. A notorious anti-vaccine gadfly called for gun violence against volunteers canvassing Los Angeles-area homes to encourage the life-saving inoculations.

388,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/HWXDZhcIjaM/,"President Barack Obama on Monday issued a somber call to action to US governors to fight gun violence after a weekend shooting spree, allegedly by an Uber driver, left six dead in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In what has become a grim tradition after every mass shooting, Obama made remarks decrying the nation's epidemic of gun-related deaths, and urged the nation to join together to curb the sale of firearms. ""On Saturday, another one of our communities was terrorized by gun violence. As many of you read, six people were gunned down in a rampage in Michigan,"" Obama told a White House gathering of US governors. ""Before I joined all of you, I called the mayor, the sheriff, and the police chief there, and told them that they would have whatever federal support they needed in their investigation,"" he said. The alleged shooter, Jason Brian Dalton, 45, was to be arraigned Monday on several charges, including murder. Obama voiced praise for Kalamazoo law enforcement and emergency officials for their quick response to the shooting. He expressed sympathy for ""families who are shattered today,"" and said more government action is needed to keep firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. ""Earlier this year, I took some steps that will make it harder for dangerous people like this individual to buy a gun, but clearly we're going to need to do more if we're going to keep innocent Americans safe,"" Obama said. ""I've got to assume that all of you are just as tired as I am of seeing this stuff happen in your states,"" he said. ""That's an area where we also need to partner and think about what we can do in a common sense way -- in a bipartisan way without some of the ideological rhetoric that so often surrounds that issue. Last month, Obama announced a series of executive orders to tighten regulations on firearm sales, including those conducted online. The measures would strengthen the existing background check system, and allow health care providers to report names of mentally ill patients into the database. Obama last month also vowed not to campaign or vote for any candidate -- Democrat or Republican -- who opposes tighter gun laws. There are an estimated 350 million firearms in the United States, more guns as people. Around 30,000 people are killed in America every year by guns, mostly in suicides.

Host Andrea Tantaros noted that faculty at the University of Houston had warned that the state's new open carry law could threaten free speech on campus. ""Professors are advising each other to avoid sensitive topics in class if students are armed,"" Tantaros explained. ""They are not telling their faculty to do this based on anything that's actually happened,"" co-host Sandra Smith said. ""They're making these statements based on fear and fear alone. There's no evidence that this isn't going to go well or this isn't going to work out or students or going to act in any different way [because some of them are armed]."" Tantaros concluded the segment by suggesting that armed students could have prevented the mass shooting at Virginia Tech -- and then turned her attention to a San Francisco school board that had approved a proposal to give middle school students access to condoms. Guest host Geraldo Rivera called the idea ""kind of wiggy."" ""I'm not crazy about it,"" he said. ""They're not just putting the bucket out there like trick-or-treat, you do have to talk to somebody,"" Tantaros admitted. ""But I do agree with you, Geraldo. I think it's too soon for these middle schoolers. I think they should focus on education, reading, writing, arithmetic."" ""I know this is such a highly sexualized culture and it's happening younger and younger and younger,"" she observed. ""With the AIDS scare, a lot of people in the past decades were using protection more. And new, young kids are having sex earlier. They don't have the same confrontation that certain generations did with the AIDS crisis. And there is concern kids are having sex sooner and sooner and they're having unprotected sex."" Tantaros added: ""It's just the job of the parents to educate their children [about sex]."" In the end, most of the hosts did agree that it would be acceptable for middle school students to have access to condoms with a parent's permission. ""First thing I'm going to do, I'm going to go to school,"" Rivera said. ""I'm not going to make a scene about it, but I'm going to be intensely upset and engaged.""

390,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/2qmf-Q1EkLg/,"The mother of Columbine killer Dylan Klebold has given her first television interview about the 1999 mass shooting. Sue Klebold spoke to ABC News' Diane Sawyer to talk about her son and his actions as she promotes a new memoir, “A Mother’s Reckoning: Living in the Aftermath of Tragedy,” whose profits she will donate toward research and charitable foundations that focus on mental health. “There is never a day that goes by where I don't think of the people that Dylan harmed,” she said, and Sawyer commented on her choice of verb. “I think it's easier for me to say harmed than killed, and it's still hard for me after all this time,” Klebold said. “It is very hard to live with the fact that someone you loved and raised has brutally killed people in such a horrific way.” Her son was 17 when he and a friend, 18-year-old Eric Harris, opened fire April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School, killing 12 classmates and one teacher, as well as wounding 24 other people, before they took their own lives. Klebold said she believed, as most parents do, that she would have known if something was wrong with her son -- but she said it was very hard to live with the guilt that she had failed to recognize any warning signs. “I felt that I was a good mom ... that he would, he could talk to me about anything,” she said. “Part of the shock of this was that learning that what I believed and how I lived and how I parented was an invention in my own mind. That it, it was a completely different world that he was living in.” Klebold said she understands why the families of her son's victims are angry with her. “I just remember sitting there and reading about them, all these kids and the teacher,” Klebold said. “And I keep thinking, constantly thought, how I would feel if it were the other way around and one of their children had shot mine. I would feel exactly the way they did. I know I would. I know I would.” The entire interview will air Friday night at 10 p.m. on ""20/20."" Klebold has spoken to reporters and written in the past about her son and the massacre, but this is her first television interview. ""I wish I had known then what I know now: that it was possible for everything to seem fine with him when it was not, and that behaviors I mistook as normal for a moody teenager were actually subtle signs of psychological deterioration,"" Klebold wrote on the website for her book.

391,https://www.upworthy.com/the-real-reason-behind-the-fbis-encryption-battle-with-apple,"The TL;DR version is that the FBI is having trouble breaking into the iPhone formerly belonging to Syed Farook, one of the shooters involved in the tragic massacre in San Bernardino, California. Apple agreed to help ... but the FBI took this a step further and obtained a court order for Apple to provide a way to bypass several security features on the phone without erasing its data. Apple claims this would involve creating a new version of iOS (which some have dubbed ""FBiOS"") with a back door that has serious privacy and security implications.  It's not that Apple can't do what the FBI is asking of them; it's that they shouldn't. The company did cooperate by providing the data that was already in their possession. But they were less comfortable with the potential slippery slope of the FBI's override request and the precedent that kind of government overreach would establish for the future. Apple CEO Tim Cook told the feds as much.  ""You want master access to every Apple device? Nah-uh. Not on my watch, pal."" Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Stringer/Getty Images. Actually, it's not. While the iPhone itself has been around since 2007, this specific issue has to do with the new encryption policies Apple introduced with iOS 8 in 2014. ""Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access [your personal] data,"" the company said at the time. ""So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."" It's almost like they saw this coming. And the FBI wasn't happy about it back then, either. As FBI Director James Comey said after Apple's encryption started catching on, ""This disconnect has created a significant public safety problem. ... Uploading to the cloud doesn't include all of the stored data on a bad guy's phone, which has the potential to create a black hole for law enforcement."" It's almost like they saw this coming, too. And they've been asking for access ever since.  Photo by Carrrrrlos/Flickr. This all came to a head in fall of 2015, when the Justice Department asked for Apple's help to crack the iPhone (running iOS 7) of a drug dealer named Jun Feng. ""Apple has repeatedly assisted law enforcement officers in federal criminal cases by extracting data from passcode-locked iPhones pursuant to court orders,"" the government argued. ""Apple has acknowledged that it has the technical capability to do so again in this case."" It's a classic method of manipulation. ""Just one more tiny favor, that's all! Just this once!"" This time, it was a drug dealer; but next time, it could just be a kid who illegally downloaded the new Kanye record. So Apple drew a line in the sand.  Photo by Robyn Beck/Getty Images. On one hand, it was the highest death toll since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre three years prior, and an absolute tragedy. But mass shootings aren't hard to come by in this country, even if there is some debate about what exactly qualifies as a ""mass shooting."" There was Dylann Roof, for example, the radical white supremacist who killed nine people at a historic black church in South Carolina. There was Robert Lewis Dear, an anti-abortion radical who killed three people, including a university police officer, and injured nine more at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado. Elliot Rodger was spurred on by radical misogyny and killed six people and wounded seven others in Isla Vista, California. And who can forget Wade Michael Page, another radical white supremacist who killed six people at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin? Or Jared Loughner, whose radical right-wing anti-government ideology led him to kill six people and injure 11 more, including a Congresswoman, at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona? The difference between these and the San Bernardino shootings? Syed Farook represents a unique opportunity for the FBI that the other shooters didn't.  Photo by Robyn Beck/Getty Images. And the people who were allegedly responsible for the San Bernardino massacre? They were Muslims. So why did the FBI decide that it was finally the right time to ask for that super-special secret master key that they've been after for years? Because they could.  Because Islamophobia is on the rise, which makes it easier for them to get the unrestricted access they've been after so they can use it in the future whenever they want, regardless of the ""who"" or the ""why.""  Photo by Patrick T. Fallon/Stringer/Getty Images. As the face of the anti-surveillance movement said himself:  We know the U.S. government already spends a lot of time and resources spying on Muslims, even without an Apple master key. They do the same to ""black extremists"" and other left-wing ""radical"" movements such as Occupy as well. And for the $500 million spent for every victim of terrorism, 90% of those caught up in this snooping are normal people like you and me. Let's refuse to perpetuate the racial fears that make this kind of subtle attack on our privacy possible. Need a mood boost to help you sail through the weekend?
