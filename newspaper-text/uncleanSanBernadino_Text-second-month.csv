He said he'll meet his attorney general, Loretta Lynch, on Monday to see what executive actions might be possible. Steps to strengthen background checks could come next week. ""The gun lobby is loud and well-organized in its defense of effortlessly available guns for anyone,"" Obama said Friday in his weekly radio address. ""The rest of us are going to have to be just as passionate and well-organized in our defense of our kids."" He said he gets so many letters from parents, teachers and children about the ""epidemic of gun violence"" that he can't ""sit around and do nothing."" He added: ""I get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time these tragedies happen; who share my belief that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms; and who share my belief we can protect that right while keeping an irresponsible, dangerous few from inflicting harm on a massive scale."" Obama said he was moving unilaterally because Congress had failed to address the growing problem of gun violence. ""A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence,"" he said in the recorded address. Currently, federally licensed firearms dealers are required to seek background checks on potential firearm purchasers. But advocacy groups say some of the people who sell firearms at gun shows are not federally licensed, increasing the chance of sales to customers prohibited by law from purchasing guns. A source familiar with the administration's efforts said Obama is expected to take executive action next week that would set a ""reasonable threshold"" for when sellers have to seek a background check. That person didn't know whether it would be based on the number of guns sold or revenue generated through gun sales. The source, a member of a gun-control advocacy group, was not authorized to discuss details before the announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity. White House officials won't confirm the timing. The National Rifle Association opposes expanded background-check systems. The organization's Institute for Legislative Action says studies have shown that people sent to state prison because of gun crimes typically get guns through theft, the black market or family and friends. Going into his final year in office, Obama said his New Year's resolution is to move forward on unfinished business. ""That's especially true for one piece of unfinished business, that's our epidemic of gun violence,"" Obama said in the radio address. He said a bipartisan bill from three years ago requiring background checks for almost everyone had huge support, including among a majority of NRA households. But the Senate blocked it. ""Each time, we're told that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, so we shouldn't do anything,"" he said. ""We know that we can't stop every act of violence. But what if we tried to stop even one?"" Reaction to Obama's announcement was slight. Doug Andres, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in an email that the White House ""has not communicated with us, and we have not been briefed."" ""We will consider options once we have information, but what seems apparent is none of these ideas would have prevented the recent atrocities,"" he added. ""Our focus should be on the consistent causes of these acts -- mental illnesses and terrorism -- rather than infringing on law-abiding Americans' constitutional rights."" While most GOP presidential candidates did not provide immediate reaction to Obama's announcement, they are expected to talk about it in the coming days. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is to attend a gun show in his home state Monday, where he will discuss the high marks he has received from the National Rifle Association. The president plans to make his case for additional gun restrictions in a number of forums in the coming month, according to his aides, including during his Jan. 12 State of the Union address. Legal Concerns Obama began examining how he could tighten the nation's gun rules after October's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., but administration lawyers have spent months reviewing any proposals to ensure they can withstand legal scrutiny. The idea of requiring informal gun dealers to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and perform background checks on potential buyers first came up two years ago but was shelved over legal concerns. The current federal statute dictates that those who are ""engaged in the business"" of dealing firearms need to obtain a federal license -- and, therefore, conduct background checks -- but exempts anyone ""who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms."" Gun-control advocates -- including former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who was injured in a 2011 mass shooting, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- have met personally with Obama over the past month to push for the background-check expansion and other measures. Everytown for Gun Safety spokesman Erika Soto Lamb, whose group was founded with Bloomberg's support, said the current interpretation of what it means to be ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms is ""a hazy definition that allows high-volume sellers to transfer thousands of guns without background checks, no questions asked."" Other proposals the administration has been weighing include requiring federally licensed gun dealers to report any lost and stolen guns to the National Crime Information Center; publishing aggregate background-check denial data for guns sold by unlicensed sellers; clarifying that convicted abusers are prohibited from having guns regardless of their marital status; and instructing federal law enforcement officers to identify and arrest criminals who attempt to buy illegal guns. Groups Mobilize Any action by the president is said to be sure to set off a major backlash from gun-rights activists and Republican lawmakers who have blocked legislative action in the past. On Thursday, the NRA institute launched the first in a video series attacking gun-control advocates. Groups such as MoveOn.org, however, have begun to mobilize firearm owners to support expanded background checks and other measures aimed at curbing gun violence. David Mark Williams, a farmer in Halfway, Ore., described guns as ""a tool. If you're hunting or living a rural lifestyle, you're going to have a firearm."" But Williams, who went to Washington this fall with MoveOn.org to meet with members of both parties, said he resigned his NRA membership after its president opposed stricter gun laws in the aftermath of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. ""I'm also a supporter of rational, reasonable gun-control measures,"" he said. Advocates from groups such as the Metro Industrial Association said the president could do much more to curb the nearly 90 gun-related deaths that take place each day in the U.S. by not going to the aid of gun manufacturers who are being sued for negligence; by providing additional funding for the development of ""smart gun"" technology; and by using the federal government's purchasing power to pressure gun manufacturers to take more responsibility for reducing gun violence. But Arkadi Gerney, a senior fellow at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, said in an email Thursday that it was ""extremely encouraging that the president appears poised"" to enhance the enforcement of existing gun laws given congressional resistance to such measures. ""Along with progress in state legislatures and actions taken by governors and attorneys general, the steps the White House is considering would make it somewhat less likely that guns will end up in the wrong hands,"" Gerney said. ""And, with gunfire claiming the lives of 33,000 American a year, even incremental steps can have life-saving impact.""

1,http://www.eurweb.com/2016/01/obamas-plan-to-curb-guns-moving-forward/,"*(Via Washington Post) – President Obama will press ahead with a set of executive actions on guns next week despite growing concerns in the United States over terrorism that have dampened some Americans’ enthusiasm for tighter firearms restrictions. The president will meet Monday with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to finalize a series of new gun control measures and will announce his package of proposals soon after, according to several individuals who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. One of the main proposals Obama is poised to adopt would require some unlicensed gun dealers to get licenses and conduct background checks on potential buyers. The change is aimed at occasional dealers, including some who sell online frequently or rent tables at gun shows but do not have a storefront. Obama began examining how he could tighten the nation’s gun rules after October’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. Administration lawyers have spent months reviewing various proposals to make sure they can withstand legal challenges. The idea of requiring informal gun dealers to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and of conducting background checks came up two years ago when White House officials drafted a proposal for dealers who sell at least 50 guns annually.

Motivated by the rash of gun violence the country has suffered over the last several years, Obama is intent on strengthening America's gun laws. Obama will make a pitch for public support in an hour-long live town hall meeting, to be held on Thursday evening. The meeting will be hosted by Anderson Cooper and broadcast on CNN.

RELATED Friend of accused San Bernardino shooter indicted for conspiracy The president has increasingly exercised his executive powers to carry out his domestic agenda -- most recently on climate change, bolstering emissions standards. He's promised to take a similar approach to gun control. Specifically, the administration plans to require licensing for more small-scale gun sellers who are currently exempt from certain regulations. As Politico recently reported, this would close the so-called gun show loophole and require these sellers to conduct background checks. The White House would also like to strengthen rules on reporting lost and stolen guns.

5,http://www.inquisitr.com/2679952/obama-taking-executive-action-on-gun-control-second-amendment-supporters-rally-against-the-order/,"President Barack Obama will finalize a plan to take executive action on gun control. The proposed order has Second Amendment supporters, like the National Rifle Association and Republican presidential candidates, rallying against the White House. In a related Inquisitr report, CNN will broadcast a live Town Hall meeting, where President Obama will discuss his executive action on gun control. The event, being held at George Mason University, is scheduled to air Thursday at 8 p.m., ET. After the October shootings at an Oregon community college, Obama requested White House advisors to explore gun control initiatives that could be enacted through executive action. Based on these recommendations, the president will attempt to bypass Congress in order to tighten and clarify current regulations. The commander-in-chief intends to meet with Attorney General Loretta Lynch today to go over and conclude a potential gun control strategy that would hopefully curtail gun violence. President Obama believes executive action is necessary, as Congress has been reluctant to act on the problem in the past.President Obama to meet with Attorney General Loretta Lynch tomorrow to discuss ways of reducing U.S. gun violence https://t.co/GFg8fGHkdn— Newsweek (@Newsweek) January 3, 2016While on vacation in Hawaii, Obama announced the issue could no longer be ignored. President Obama to meet with Attorney General Loretta Lynch tomorrow to discuss ways of reducing U.S. gun violence https://t.co/GFg8fGHkdn ""I get too many letters from parents and teachers and kids to sit around and do nothing,"" he said in a weekly address. Although not finalized, the gun control measures are expected to focus on sales made through small firearms dealers without a background check. Some transactions, like the ones made at gun shows or by private parties, do not fall under the current background check rules. As it stands, only gun dealers licensed through the federal government require a buyer's criminal history be verified. Yet, current law allows people to sell guns from ""personal collections"" without needing to perform the check Previously, Obama has indicated that the description of a licensed gun dealer needs to be more encompassing to include these types of transactions. The new gun control measures are expected to include an expansion of the definition. Should the classification be stretched to include small dealers, it may limit the number of trades made through private sales and somewhat close the ""gun-show loophole."" Even though those transactions will not be eliminated entirely, Obama's executive action can make them more difficult. The president's gun control action will most likely strengthen reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns, as well. Two years ago, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives suggested mandatory reporting of lost firearms to the federal agency. However, the gun industry successfully shot down the proposal, saying voluntary reporting was enough. Several GOP presidential candidates disagree with the president's action, proclaiming such an order may be a violation of the law and of the Second Amendment. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said the president's executive order may be unlawful.""Now this president wants to act as if he is a king, as if he is a dictator. Fact is, if he wants to make changes to these laws, go to Congress and convince the Congress that they're necessary. But this is going to be another illegal executive action, which I'm sure will be rejected by the courts.""Jeb Bush, also appearing on Fox, said Obama's ""first impulse is always to take rights away from law-abiding citizens, and it's wrong."" At a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, GOP front-runner Donald Trump said any action that could change the Second Amendment would be quickly reversed once he was elected president. At least one Democrat presidential candidate seems to support the administration's executive order. Prospective nominee Hilary Clinton plans to continue the momentum for increased gun control measures should she win the presidency. ""I will take on that fight. I'm very hopeful and excited that the president is going to take some action with executive action in the next week or two,"" she commented during a recent campaign event in New Hampshire. The Obama Administration's gun control action may tighten rules for sales at gun shows. [Photo by Christopher Capozziello/Getty Images]The drive for more gun control by the Obama Administration is not new. The president proposed a series of executive actions several years ago but got push-back from Congress. After the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, an Obama-led bill was offered to Congress to tighten gun control laws. However, the bill never passed, and the president is convinced this was due to direct influence from the NRA, the country's leading gun-rights advocate. NRA spokesperson Jennifer Baker said the president didn't get his way with Congress three years ago because most Americans are against more gun control. ""Now he is doing what he always does when he doesn't get his way, which is to defy the will of the people and issue an executive order,"" she said on Saturday. Baker continued her comments by saying the planned executive order is a ruse that will not increase public safety but is only being done to placate billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The president's proposed gun control plan is likely to follow recommendations made by Bloomberg's anti-gun nonprofit organization, Everytown. The start of 2016 will potentially be without a bang. The executive order announcement comes ahead of the president's final State of the Union speech set for next week as well as the Iowa caucuses in February. The meeting today with the Attorney General will reveal the details on how Obama plans to take executive action on gun control. [Photo by Martin H.

On Monday, the President is meeting in the Oval Office with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey and the deputy director of the ATF to discuss executive actions he can take to combat gun violence in America, and on Thursday he will participate in a gun control town hall discussion hosted by CNN. President Obama began reconsidering taking executive action on gun control in the wake of the mass shooting at an Oregon community college. At the time, Obama was reportedly considering a reboot of a 2013 proposal that would expand the definition of who is considered a gun dealer and is therefore required conduct background checks on potential buyers. An administration official said in October that the timing on the gun executive action was up in the air, but it seems to be taking center stage as the President kicks off the first week of his final year in office. Obama has had no luck getting substantive gun control legislation passed in Congress, despite a series of mass shootings during his second term. Over the course of his two terms in office, Obama has delivered speeches on gun violence in the wake of nearly a dozen tragedies. He usually struck a somber tone, but following the Oregon college shooting in October he was visibly angered by the fact that he was discussing the same issue yet again. The bulk of his frustration has been directed at Congress, which hasn’t budged on gun control during Obama’s time in office. “Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough,” Obama said hours after the shooting at Umpqua Community College. “It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America — next week, or a couple of months from now.” Contact us at letters@time.com.",2016-01-04 11:01:20,President Obama Starts Final Year in Office by Tackling Gun Control,,40362,http://www.time.com/time/

11,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/04/san-bernardino-inland-regional-center-reopens-mass-shooting,"The complex had been shut since 2 December when a couple burst into a holiday party and opened fire in the deadliest terror attack on US soil since 9/11 Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.18 BST The Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino has reopened for the first time since last month’s massacre, allowing around 600 employees to return to work at the site. After passing guards who checked identity cards, the workers were expected to gather in small groups to talk on Monday before resuming their duties serving 30,000 people with developmental disabilities in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.  The centre has been shut since 2 December, when Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, burst into a holiday luncheon in a conference room and opened fire, killing 14 people and wounding 20, in the deadliest terror attack in the US since 9/11. The conference room remained shut – authorities have not yet decided what to do with it – but the rest of the campus, comprising two large red stone buildings, was open. Crews have cleaned up broken glass and other debris from the attack and erected a chain-link fence around the complex. Professional counsellors were on site for any employees who felt in need of their services. “We have security guards at each entrance area. We continue to measure the security and we will continue to look at it,” Lavinia Johnson, the centre’s executive director, told reporters outside the facility. “Today I will be spending time with my staff, my directors and my managers and have welcoming remarks for them. We have food inside the agency as well as counselling for those who are still not ready and still continuing the healing process. Most of us are relieved to be back at work. We want to continue with the normalcy, and we miss each other very much.” The World Way, a Christian ministry, set up a prayer tent near the entrance and provided coffee and breakfast bars. Later on Monday, California’s governor, Jerry Brown, was expected to attend a private memorial service for the victims in nearby Ontario. San Bernardino’s step towards normality came as prosecutors prepared the case against Enrique Marquez, a friend of Farook who purchased the guns used in the massacre. Marquez, who is being held without bail, is expected to enter a plea in an arraignment Wednesday at the US district court in Riverside. Farook, 28, and Malik, 29, died in a gun battle with police a few miles away soon after the massacre. Investigators are still piecing together how Farook, a US citizen who was born in Chicago to Pakistani parents, and Malik, a Pakistani national, came to be radicalised. The couple allegedly pledged allegiance to the extremist group Islamic State. Farook – described by relatives and colleagues as a quiet, reserved and devout Muslim – was a county environmental health inspector and had worked alongside the victims. He had left the holiday luncheon, part of a daylong training session, and returned with Malik, both wielding assault rifles and wearing masks and combat-style clothing. The site remained frozen for weeks while investigators combed for evidence. A few employees visited during that time to retrieve personal belongings, but most stayed away. Staff used laptops and iPads to access patient records through a web-based operating system, letting them work remotely and serve a community of children with autism, mentally disabled adults and other clients in what is a largely poor and working-class swath of California. Staff were looking forward to reuniting, a centre spokesperson told the Associated Press. With the two shooters dead, prosecutors have focused on Farook’s friend, Marquez. Relatives and friends have expressed shock that a 24-year-old known for goofy humour, fixing old cars and enjoying beer could be implicated in an extremist plot. Federal prosecutors have painted a different picture, saying that as Marquez’s friendship with Farook grew, he converted to Islam, started attending a mosque in 2010 and became a wannabe terrorist. Marquez allegedly made false statements in 2011 and 2012 when he bought two semiautomatic rifles for Farook, who feared he would not pass a background check. According to an affidavit, the two plotted attacks on the 91 Freeway in Corona and at Riverside City College in 2011 and 2012, but neither attack went ahead. Marquez faces five charges, including supplying the weapons and smokeless powder contained in an explosive device found at the scene of the attack, plus marriage fraud. In 2014, he married Mariya Chernykh, a Russian national whose sister is married to Farook’s older brother. Marquez faces up to 50 years in federal prison if convicted on all charges.",2016-01-04 13:40:43,San Bernardino office building reopens a month after mass shooting left 14 dead,"politics and government,labor,terrorism",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

14,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/04/obama-to-unveil-new-gun-control-measures-after-meeting-with-lynch,"President to set out plan on Tuesday that will prevent firearms from being sold at gun shows and on the internet without having to go through necessary checks First published on Mon 4 Jan 2016 20.55 GMT Thousands of unlicensed gun shows and online dealers will be forced to conduct customer background checks for the first time in a fresh effort by Barack Obama to tackle America’s epidemic of deadly shootings.  In measures aimed at circumventing political deadlock in Congress that will inevitably set off a fierce battle in the courts, the president is due to close a loophole in the current system as well as call for greater spending on enforcement and new technology that could prevent unauthorised gun use. “The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can’t hold America hostage,” Obama said in a tweet that accompanied an official preview of the announcement due on Tuesday. “We can’t accept this carnage in our communities.” The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can't hold America hostage. We can't accept this carnage in our communities. The news was welcomed by gun safety campaigners, although more than a dozen separate calls for other executive actions do not appear to have made the White House draft proposal and other measures that would require congressional funding to be implemented. “President Obama’s decision to clarify and enforce the law requiring more gun sellers to conduct background checks is an important victory for public safety and a setback for criminals and gun traffickers,” said former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, a co-founder of Everytown for Gun Safety, the main lobby group advocating stricter gun laws. Earlier the group described the issue of closing background-check loopholes as the “centerpiece” of its hopes for Obama’s action on guns. “It doesn’t matter where you conduct your business – from a store, at gun shows or over the internet: if you are in the business of selling firearms, you must get a license and conduct background checks,” said the White House statement. It also called for 200 additional agents in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to be included in the 2017 federal budget, a move that would require the Republican-controlled Congress to drop its longstanding suspicion of the agency. But a separate call for $500m in extra mental health funding may stand more chance of receiving bipartisan support as a number of Republicans have recently flagged the issue as an alternative approach to dealing with mass shootings. The White House also plans to better join the dots between different agencies, requiring, for example, that people registered as mentally ill with the Department of Social Security have their information passed to the FBI for the purposes of background checks on gun sales. “Some of the gaps in our country’s gun laws can only be fixed through legislation, which is why the President continues to call on Congress to pass the kind of commonsense gun safety reforms supported by a majority of the American people,” the White House said in its statement. Speaking after a meeting with senior officials, Obama promised that sweeping new gun control measures would save lives and spare families from mass shootings. “We have to be very clear that this is not going to solve every violent crime in this country or prevent every mass shooting and is not going to keep every gun out of the hand of a criminal,” Obama said after a meeting with attorney general Loretta Lynch to review her recommendations. “It will potentially save lives and spare families the pain and the extraordinary loss that they have suffered as a consequence of firearms getting into the hand of the wrong people,” he added. Republicans have promised to fight such measures in the courts, a process that could take up much of the remaining year that Obama has in office. “While we don’t yet know the details of the plan, the president is at minimum subverting the legislative branch, and potentially overturning its will,” said House speaker Paul Ryan in a statement. “His proposals to restrict gun rights were debated by the United States Senate, and they were rejected. No president should be able to reverse legislative failure by executive fiat, not even incrementally ... This is a dangerous level of executive overreach, and the country will not stand for it.” White House spokesman Josh Earnest confirmed on Monday that the president had made up his mind to take the actions, but insisted the measures – expected to be unveiled as soon as Tuesday – would withstand legal challenge. “I feel confident in telling you now that what the president does announce will be the kinds of actions in which we have confidence that they are within the legal ability of the United States to carry out these actions,” he told reporters. Campaigners who have helped draft a wishlist of up to 17 different executive actions also insisted that the flagship proposal of closing background check loopholes was within the remit of the president. “We have no concerns whatsoever about the legality of action in this area,” added Oransky. “We think it is squarely within the power of the administration to clarify a statutory definition that is vague. This is exactly the kind of thing that the White House and DOJ are supposed to do.” Officials hope that clarifying the so-called “engaged in the business” language in existing background check legislation will go a long way to prevent criminals and mentally ill people from buying guns through sellers who exploit a current loophole designed only for hobbyists and personal sales. “Although it is my strong belief that for us to get our complete arm around the issues, Congress needs to act, what I asked my team to do is to see what more we could do to strengthen our enforcement and prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands,” said Obama. “To make sure that criminals, people who are mentally unstable, those who could pose a danger to themselves or others are less likely to be able to get a gun.” The president said the measures, which may also involve attempts to arrest those who lie about failing a background check when trying to buy weapons, would have the support of the majority of law-abiding gun owners. “I have just received back a report from attorney Lynch [and others] about some of the ideas and initiatives that they claim will make a difference,” he said. “The good news is that these are not only recommendations that are well within my legal authority and executive branch, but they are also ones that the overwhelming majority of American people – including gun owners – support. “We have been very careful in recognising that we have strong tradition of gun ownership in this country and that even those who possess firearms for hunting, for self-protection and other legitimate reasons, want to make sure that they don’t get into the wrong hands,” added Obama.",2016-01-04 15:55:14,Obama moves on gun control action after meeting with attorney general,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Loading... January 4, 2016 President Obama defended his administration's plans to tighten the nation's gun-control restrictions without going through Congress, insisting Monday that the steps he'll announce fall within his legal authority and uphold the constitutional right to own a gun. Flanked by his attorney general and the head of the FBI, Obama offered few details about the list of recommendations he's received and will come out with over the next few days. Behind the scenes, though, Obama's administration has been preparing an effort to expand background checks on gun sales by forcing more sellers to register as federally licensed gun dealers. ""This is not going to solve every violent crime in this country,"" Obama said, setting expectations for what he can do on his own. ""It's not going to prevent every mass shooting; it's not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal. It will potentially save lives and spare families the pain of these extraordinary losses."" More than three years after the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, with many other mass shootings since, Obama is training his attention once again on a policy goal that has eluded his administration. He tried the legislative route in 2013, pushing hard for a package of gun control measures including expanded background checks. But that effort collapsed spectacularly in Congress. Obama and his aides have described their inability to move the issue forward so far as one of the most frustrating failures in his presidency. This time, with barely a year left in office and his political currency dwindling, Obama is eschewing Congress in favor of presidential action that doesn't require a vote — legislative action being a non-starter in the Republican-controlled Congress. Already, the issue has become a hot topic in the presidential campaign, ensuring that whatever steps Obama takes will be heavily politicized by both sides. Even before being announced, Obama's steps were provoking a major confrontation with Congress, with Republicans and gun rights advocates pledging and preparing to derail them before they're implemented by challenging Obama's authority to create impediments on gun ownership on his own. Mindful of those inevitable attacks, the White House carefully crafted the steps to bolster their prospects of surviving in court, and Obama said he was acting ""well within my legal authority."" Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. ""I'm also confident that the recommendations that are being made by our team here are ones that are entirely consistent with the Second Amendment and people's lawful right to bear arms,"" Obama said. He paid homage to the ""strong tradition of gun ownership"" in the US, but added that even hunters and other gun owners ""want to make sure the wrong people don't have them for the wrong reasons."" The changes to the background check would be aimed at some unregistered sellers who skirt the requirement by selling at gun shows, online or informal settings. Other moves being considered include improving reporting of lost and stolen weapons and beefing up inspections of licensed dealers, according to people familiar with the plans who would not be identified discussing proposals before they are complete.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

San Bernardino County employees line up to enter Citizens Business Bank Arena, where security was tight Monday, Jan. 4, at a memorial for victims of the Dec. 2 shooting.  Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani speaks to San Bernardino County employees at the Citizens Business Bank Arena on Monday, Jan. 4, at a memorial for victims of the Dec. 2 mass shooting. ""Come to San Bernardino and spend money and tell the terrorists 'screw you,'"" he said to loud applause. ""You can't beat us. We're stronger than you are.""  Giuliani got a standing ovation after his speech.  San Bernardino County employees took time off work Monday, Jan. 4, to fill an arena and honor their colleagues who were killed or injured in the Dec. 2 mass shooting. The 2 p.m. ceremony at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario featured a religious speech from Pastor Rick Warren, of Saddleback Church in Orange County, pondering how to grapple with such a tragegy. It also saw former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who led the city during 9/11 and its aftermath, deliver defiant remarks against terrorism. “Come to San Bernardino and spend money and tell the terrorists ‘screw you,'” he said to loud applause. “You can’t beat us. We’re stronger than you are.” Giuliani got a standing ovation after his speech. As for Warren, he posed a tough question that was likely on the minds of many. “How do you find the strength to go on? What do you do when your heart has been broken in a thousand pieces?” The grieving process will take time, he said. “You don’t get over it,” he said. “You get through it.” Warren told the crowd, “You need to feel your feelings and let it out.” He talked about how he and his wife overcame grief when their youngest son took his own life. “You need to release your grief … let it come out,” he said. Grief is a good thing, he said. “Grief is a tool God has given us to get through the transitions of life. It’s healthy.” Never tell someone you know it feels, he said. There is only one appropriate response for grief. “I’m sorry for your loss,” he said. It’s important to receive help from others, he said, and not to feel bad about what happened. “Bitterness will eat you alive.” “You can’t hold onto hurt,” said Warren, who launched what became one of the nation’s largest megachurches and now includes 10 Southern California campuses. Warren called the shooting “evil” and quoted a Bible verse from Proverbs about how God will lead mourners “through the valley of the shadow of death.” “What do you do when you are going through hell? You walk on,” he said. Then Giuliani spoke, telling the audience he felt sympathy and empathy for them and offered his prayers and condolences. He was mayor when terrorists hijackers slammed planes into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2011. “I know what you’re going through,” he said. “I lost so many of my fellow citizens and 10 of my closest friends.” “You can make us mourn, you can make us cry. There’s one thing you can’t do. You can’t break our spirit,” Giuliani said to loud applause. He urged the crowd to tell people to visit San Bernardino as a strike against the attackers. “Fight back. Make something good come out of this,” said Giuliani, who also told them not to blame Muslims for the tragedy. Of the shooters, he said: “They cannot beat us.” “This is psychological warfare,” he said. “They want you to be afraid.” “Come to San Bernardino and spend money and tell the terrorists ‘screw you,'” he said to loud applause. “You can’t beat us. We’re stronger than you are.” “Let this become a turning point for San Bernardino,” Giuliani said. “You got the whole country behind you.” “This is a long war with a very sick and determined adversary,” he said. There will be more terrorist attacks. “People around the world are planning to kill us. We have to stand together,” he said. The crowd gave Giuliani a standing ovation after his speech. Next up was San Bernardino County Supervisor Janice Rutherford. She told employees “We have to be careful not to spread sorrow. Find the good things (in life) and spread good cheer.” She applauded county workers for their courage, bravery, compassion, dignity and grace in facing the tragedy. “In the worst moments, the best of our characters come out,” she said. As employees took their seats for the 2 p.m. service, instrumental music played in the background. An image of a desert landscape and mountains appeared on a large screen behind the stage with the words: “Remember, Honor and Support.” Thousands of county employees were expected at the ceremony, which was attended by Gov. Jerry Brown and California Attorney General Kamala Harris. Giuliani waived his usual speaking fee for the event, county spokesman David Wert said. Giuliani typically makes between $100,000 to $300,000 per speech, according to articles in the New York Times, Huffington Post and Washington Post. San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors Chairman James Ramos welcomed the audience of San Bernardino County employees to the private memorial service. The tragedy has brought together workers who have shown resilience despite the loss of their colleagues and friends, he said. “As a county we will never forget Dec, 2, 2015,” Ramos said. “The events of that day could have torn us asunder … but they have driven us closer together to fulfill our mission of public service.” Outside the arena before the event, security was tight. A sheriff’s deputy cruised the aisles of the parking lot in an SUV and a command trailer was positioned in sight of the arena’s entrance. Kristin Stevens, who works for the San Bernardino County library system, said the mood at work has been solemn, but employees are “supportive of each other and have an attitude of perseverance through difficult time.” Over the long term, Stevens said, she expects residents and county employees to have “maybe a greater sense of community and the necessity to be aware and to support one another.” Beryl Holman, who works in the county’s preschool services department, said some county employees have been on edge since the shooting. The office has been “not a happy place,” she said. “Everybody’s been pulling together, but I also know a couple people that were scared to come (to the memorial).” Holman said the attack didn’t make her feel significantly less safe at work. “My opinion is it could have happened anywhere,” she said. For Lorraine Aguirre, a victim advocate in the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office, said the shooting and the aftermath “hit really close to home.” Her office has been helping shooting victims and their families. She and her co-workers have been so busy in recent weeks that there hasn’t been time to process their emotions. What happened still seems “surreal,” she said. “I think once everything has kind of calmed down, it will affect people even more,” Aguirre said. She used to think the multiple layers of safety precautions her office already takes were excessive, but she no longer feels that way. Aguirre said she’s noticed her fellow employees seem more fearful, even if it’s below the surface. “There’s an awareness that any day, any time, something like (the attack) can happen.” But Aguirre and other employees said the memorial event is an important opportunity for them to show their support for each other and try to begin healing.

24,http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-announces-executive-actions-reduce-gun-violence-white-house-seeks-expand-2248912,"President Barack Obama will announce on Tuesday a set of executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence. The measures focus on expanding background checks, increasing enforcement of current laws and calling for more research into gun safety. The White House unveiled the proposed actions on Monday after the president met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey to discuss the initiatives. In  brief remarks on Monday, the president said that Congress’s lack of action in the wake of multiple high profile shootings this year pushed him to take these steps. “It is my strong belief that for us to get our complete arms around the problem, Congress must act,” Obama said on Monday. He emphasized that his proposals “are well within my legal authority in the executive branch but also are ones that the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners, support and believe in.”  Tomorrow, I&#39;m taking action to reduce gun violence and save lives - protecting the Second Amendment and our kids. pic.twitter.com/vNqXEhaC9M   Obama’s executive actions do not include the kind of sweeping changes he  unsuccessfully tried to get through Congress three years ago. After the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, Obama sought to close loopholes that allowed millions of guns to be sold online or at gun shows without background checks. This time, the president’s executive actions will clarify existing laws that require anyone who makes a living by selling guns to register as a licensed gun dealer and therefore conduct background checks. Decisions about which sellers need licenses will be based on a mix of business activities,  the Washington Post reported, including whether a seller processes credit cards, rents space at gun shows and has business cards. Obama plans to note that criminal penalties already exist for those who violate these laws. Other provisions of Obama’s plan include increasing support for the FBI’s background check system and adding 230 law enforcement agents. He will also direct agencies to conduct more research into gun safety technology, which would aim to prevent the accidental discharge or unauthorized use of firearms. The executive actions would also increase access to mental health care and include information in background checks about those who are prohibited from possessing a firearm for mental health reasons. Some critics are worried that allowing this information to be shared in background check systems  could reinforce the stigma around mental illness.  This is a dangerous level of executive overreach, &amp; the country will not stand for it. https://t.co/YgNrG94tjg pic.twitter.com/eMCSSSp3Rh   Obama is scheduled to discuss gun violence during a town hall meeting on Thursday evening that will be aired live on CNN. Even before the details of the president’s actions were announced Monday, Republicans and gun-rights activists sounded the alarm. “The president is again targeting law-abiding citizens, intruding further into innocent Americans’ lives,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a  statement Monday. “No president should be able to reverse legislative failure by executive fiat, not even incrementally. The American people deserve a president who will respect their constitutional rights — all of them. This is a dangerous level of executive overreach, and the country will not stand for it.” Obama is trying to make an impact on this issue in his final year after battling with Congress in the past. He said Monday that his actions would save lives, and tweeted that the gun lobby “can’t hold America hostage.”  The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can&#39;t hold America hostage. We can&#39;t accept this carnage in our communities.   “We have to be very clear this is not going to solve every violent crime in this country, is not going to prevent every mass shooting, is not going to keep guns out of the hands of every criminal,” he said to reporters Monday. “But it will potentially save lives in this country and spare families the pain and the extraordinary loss they’ve suffered.”",2016-01-04 20:03:21,"Obama Announces Executive Actions To Reduce Gun Violence: White House Seeks To Expand Background Checks, Enforcement",,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

AFP PHOTO/MANDEL NGANMANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images  WASHINGTON (AP) — Gearing up for a certain confrontation with Congress, President Barack Obama defended his plans to tighten the nation’s gun-control restrictions on his own, insisting Monday that the steps he’ll announce fall within his legal authority and uphold the constitutional right to own a gun. Opening his final year in office on an aggressive note, Obama summoned his attorney general and FBI chief to the Oval Office to firm up a set of measures he said he’d announce over the next few days. Although the details are still uncertain, Obama’s administration has been preparing behind the scenes to expand background checks on gun sales by forcing more sellers to register as dealers. “This is not going to solve every violent crime in this country,” Obama said, tempering expectations for gun control advocates calling for far-reaching executive action. “It’s not going to prevent every mass shooting; it’s not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal. It will potentially save lives and spare families the pain of these extraordinary losses.” More than three years after the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, with many other mass shootings since, Obama is training his attention once again on a policy goal that has eluded his administration. He tried the legislative route in 2013, pushing hard for a package that included expanded background checks. But that effort collapsed spectacularly in Congress. Obama and his aides have described their inability to move the issue forward as one of the most frustrating failures in his presidency. This time, with barely a year left in office and his political currency dwindling, Obama is eschewing Congress in favor of presidential action. Any proposal for new gun laws would be a non-starter in the Republican-controlled Congress — especially in a presidential election year. Obama’s steps were certain to draw intense opposition in Congress, and indeed, lawmakers and Obama’s political opponents had already started pre-emptively panning Obama’s plan. House Speaker Paul Ryan said he wasn’t sure exactly what Obama would announce, but dismissed it as an attempt to divide the country and distract from Obama’s “failed policies” to address terrorism. “The president is at minimum subverting the legislative branch, and potentially overturning its will,” said Ryan, R-Wis. The changes to the background check would be aimed at some unregistered sellers who skirt the requirement by selling at gun shows, online or informal settings. Under current law, only federally licensed firearms dealers are required to seek background checks. The administration is expected to require more people to register as dealers by altering the criteria, such as the number and frequency of guns sold, whether sellers profit off sales, whether they advertise, rent space or tables at gun shows and pay taxes. Other moves being considered include improving reporting of lost and stolen weapons and beefing up inspections of licensed dealers, according to people familiar with the plans who weren’t authorized to disclose details before the announcement. Yet from the campaign trail to the halls of Congress, critics were already taking the president to task, both for the expected content of the actions and for the manner in which he’s taking them. Republicans and gun rights advocates pledged to derail them before they can be implemented. Although the likeliest venue for a challenge appeared to be the courts, opponents were also examining other ways to try to stop Obama’s actions. Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, the House panel chairman who oversees the Justice Department budget, threatened in a letter Monday to Attorney General Loretta to withhold money for the department if it tries to implement executive action on guns. Mindful of inevitable challenges, the White House carefully crafted the steps with legal justifications in mind, White House officials said, and Obama added he was acting “well within my legal authority.” “I’m also confident that the recommendations that are being made by our team here are ones that are entirely consistent with the Second Amendment and people’s lawful right to bear arms,” Obama said. Aiming to set the stage for a productive final year in office, Obama planned to spend the week promoting the gun effort and pushing back on its critics. He met at the White House on Monday with Democratic lawmakers who have supported stricter gun control, and planned to take his argument to prime time on Thursday with a town hall discussion about gun violence on CNN. The initiative also promised to be prominent in Obama’s final State of the Union address next Tuesday, scheduled earlier than usual this year. Already, the issue has become a hot topic in the presidential campaign, ensuring that whatever steps Obama takes will be heavily politicized by both sides. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who has already proposed closing the gun show loophole, cheered Obama’s plans, and her chief primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, called it the “right thing to do.” But on the GOP side, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Obama a “petulant child” peddling illegal executive actions, while Donald Trump said he saw no need for changes. It’s not clear how large an effect the president’s action would have on keeping guns from violent criminals. Philip Cook, a Duke University professor who researches gun violence and policy, said gun shows are at least occasionally a source of weapons for traffickers, but that surveys of prisoners don’t show them to be a major source. But Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, predicted a “dramatic impact” from the steps. —— Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey, Eric Tucker and Donna Cassata contributed to this report. —— Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP.

Obama's action will seek to expand background checks for persons trying to buy a firearm and enforce existing federal gun laws.
Advertisement ""Although we have a strong tradition of gun ownership, even those who possess firearms for hunting, for self-protection and for other legitimate reasons want to make sure that the wrong people don't have them for the wrong reasons,"" Obama said Monday. The primary hangup on the issue, as Obama sees it, is a loophole allowing people to buy and sell guns from unlicensed dealers at gun shows and on the Internet.
RELATED Obama set to hold town hall meeting on gun control ""This is not going to solve every violent crime in this country,"" the president said. ""It's not going to prevent every mass shooting. It will, potentially, save lives in this country."" The main obstacle to Obama's plan for greater gun control has been the Republican-controlled Congress, where conservative lawmakers have so far pooled sufficient political capital to render the White House's plan dormant. Tuesday's executive actions will attempt to circumvent that obstacle, as they don't require congressional approval.
Advertisement The legality of Obama's executive actions, though, is expected to be challenged by Republicans. The president, however, reiterated Monday that he is confident such action is allowable under the law.
RELATED Trump says he would veto Obama's executive orders on guns ""Too many communities across the country are still suffering from the heartbreaking consequences of a gun in the wrong hands,"" the White House said on its website Monday. ""In the past decade, more than 100,000 people have died as a result of gun violence. Many of these crimes were committed by people who never should have been able to purchase a gun in the first place."" ""The President has a responsibility to do everything in his power to reduce gun violence. This week, he will,"" the administration added. The White House said the ""common sense steps"" detailed in the president's plan will facilitate four main benefits: Keeping guns away from criminals, making communities safer, increased mental health treatment, and the development of gun safety technology.
RELATED Obama to order executive action on gun control Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump said he will veto Obama's orders if he is elected president. The administration in its pitch cited numerous statistics related to gun violence -- such as an average of 30,000 people killed annually, 466 law enforcement officials killed in the last decade, and 4 million American victims of gun-related crime since 2005.

X OUR PICKS: WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama defended his administration’s plans to tighten the nation’s gun-control restrictions without going through Congress, insisting Monday that the steps he’ll announce fall within his legal authority and uphold the constitutional right to own a gun.
Flanked by his attorney general and the head of the FBI, Obama offered few details about the list of recommendations that he’s received and that will come out with over the next few days. Behind the scenes, though, his administration has been preparing an effort to expand background checks on gun sales by forcing more sellers to register as federally licensed gun dealers.
“This is not going to solve every violent crime in this country,” Obama said, setting expectations for what he can do on his own. “It’s not going to prevent every mass shooting; it’s not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal. It will potentially save lives and spare families the pain of these extraordinary losses.”
The changes to the background check would be aimed at some unregistered sellers who skirt the requirement by selling at gun shows, online or informal settings. Other moves being considered include improving reporting of lost and stolen weapons and beefing up inspections of licensed dealers, according to people familiar with the plans who would not be identified discussing proposals before they are complete. 


More than three years after the massacre in Newtown, Conn., with many other mass shootings since, Obama is training his attention once again on a policy goal that has eluded his administration. 
He tried the legislative route in 2013, pushing hard for a package of gun control measures including expanded background checks. But that effort collapsed spectacularly in Congress. 
Obama and his aides have described their inability to move the issue forward so far as one of the most frustrating failures in his presidency.
This time, with barely a year left in office and his political currency dwindling, Obama is eschewing Congress in favor of presidential action that doesn’t require a vote — legislative action being a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled Congress. Already, the issue has become a hot topic in the presidential campaign, ensuring that whatever steps Obama takes will be heavily politicized by both sides.
Even before being announced, Obama’s steps were provoking a major confrontation with Congress, with Republicans and gun rights advocates pledging and preparing to derail them before they’re implemented by challenging Obama’s authority to create impediments on gun ownership on his own. 


Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House, on Monday warned that “the president is again targeting law-abiding citizens, intruding further into innocent Americans’ lives.” 
Decrying what he said was the subversion of Congress, Ryan said the country deserved “a president who will respect their constitutional rights — all of them.” He continued, “This is a dangerous level of executive overreach, and the country will not stand for it.” 
Mindful of those inevitable attacks, the White House carefully crafted the steps to bolster their prospects of surviving in court, and Obama said he was acting “well within my legal authority.”
“I’m also confident that the recommendations that are being made by our team here are ones that are entirely consistent with the Second Amendment and people’s lawful right to bear arms,” Obama said. He paid homage to the “strong tradition of gun ownership” in the U.S., but added that even hunters and other gun owners “want to make sure the wrong people don’t have them for the wrong reasons.” WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama defended his administration’s plans to tighten the nation’s gun-control restrictions without going through Congress, insisting Monday that the steps he’ll announce fall within his legal authority and uphold the constitutional right to own a gun.

28,http://www.ocregister.com/articles/school-698536-san-building.html,"Trending:  Paul Wilson, husband of Christy Lynn Wilson, who was killed at Salon Meritage, cleans the memorial plaque.  In a photo taken by a school neighbor, emergency workers respond to the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, at the time the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.  Amid much controversy, the Aurora, Colo., theater where 12 people were killed in 2012 reopened six months later.  Construction continued in December on the new elementary school in Newtown, Conn. The site of the 2012 mass shooting was razed.  Sheriff's officers patrol the Virginia Tech campus on April 16, 2007, when a 23-year-old killed 32 people before committing suicide.  Arlia Davis, 78, looks into the closed Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, in 2001. The eatery reopened after the 1991 shooting spree, but it closed for economic reasons.  Buildings serving Southwestern College and a memorial were built at the site of 1984 mass shooting at a San Ysidro McDonald's.  There is no single answer about what to do with buildings where mass shootings or other tragedies have taken place, such as the conference building at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, where 14 died on Dec. 2. Two of the three buildings at the center, a private, nonprofit agency with more than 500 employees who work with Inland residents who have developmental disabilities, reopened Monday. But officials said they are reviewing what to do about the building where the massacre took place. It includes a coffee shop, a library and conference facilities that can be rented out. A conference room in the building had been rented by the San Bernardino County Division of Environmental Health Services for a training session. Authorities said Syed Rizwan Farook, a health services employee, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on the group, killing 14 and wounding 22. Some infamous places, such as the San Ysidro McDonald’s where 21 died in a 1984 mass shooting, and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six educators were murdered in 2012, were razed. But the theater in Aurora, Colo., where 12 people were killed in 2012 during a screening of “The Dark Knight Rises,” and a salon in Seal Beach where eight people were killed in 2011, were remodeled and reopened. And at Columbine High School in Colorado, where 13 died in 1999, the campus reopened but the library, where most of the carnage took place, was torn down and replaced. In places such as New York and Oklahoma City, where terrorist attacks destroyed the buildings, the decisions were about appropriate memorials. What to do with a surviving building that is usually accessible to the public is always a difficult passage, said psychotherapist Nancy Bohl-Penrod. Her San Bernardino-based Counseling Team International worked with victims in the Seal Beach, Columbine and 9/11 attacks. “The business needs to ask employees and get a consensus,” she said in a phone interview Monday. While many people can avoid the building, there’s no such option for those who work there, she said. “Some will be heartbroken if you take it down,” seeing it as giving the perpetrators more power, she said. “But others will want to rebuild.” When Salon Meritage in Seal Beach reopened in 2012, Sandi Fannin, the widow of slain owner Randy Fannin, said the reopening was a symbol to her that “good wins out over evil.” But on the third anniversary of the re-opening of the renamed Century Aurora 16 theater multiplex in Colorado, local resident Daisy Rothschild told the Aurora Sentinel’s website, “I don’t even drive down that street, and I avoid the mall, too … they should have torn it down or made a memorial there.” “It’s a fascinating question, and I think there are two schools of thought about it,” UC Riverside psychology professor Steven Clark said in an email. “On the one hand, we try to avoid stimuli that have negative associations. That’s an argument to tear it down,” he wrote. “But, on the other hand, there is a thing called systematic desensitization, which is a fairly common technique to help people deal with fears and phobias. The idea … is to expose ourselves to fear-inducing stimuli – in very small doses – until the fear dissipates.” Whatever is done, “for the powers that be to make a decision without consulting the people (who work there) is an incorrect way to do it,” Bohl-Penrod said. “Letting them take part empowers them, and makes them feel more in control.” Here are the outcomes for some mass-shooting sites: San Ysidro McDonald’s A gunman armed with a semi-automatic Uzi rifle, shotgun and pistol kills 21 and wounds 19 on July 18, 1984. The shooter is killed by a police sniper. McDonald’s Corp. tore the restaurant down and deeded the land to the city of San Diego, which in 1988 sold it to Southwestern College. There is a memorial at the scene. Killeen, Texas, Luby’s Cafeteria An enraged man crashes his pickup through a front window on Oct. 16, 1991, emerges from his pickup truck with a pistol in each hand, and slays 23 people, wounding 22 before committing suicide as police close in. The cafeteria reopens and does business for another nine years, closing only because of economics, its operators said. Littleton, Colo., Columbine High School Two students open fire in the school library on April 20, 1999, and kill 12 students and a teacher before taking their own lives. Most victims die in the library. The school campus eventually reopens, but the library is closed and razed. A foundation raises more than $3 million to replace it in 2001. Blacksburg, Va., Virginia Tech A 23-year-old student goes on a shooting rampage on campus on April 16, 2007, killing 32 before committing suicide. The engineering building where most of the slayings took place reopens, but only for administrative offices. Virginia Tech officials said the building will never again be used for classrooms. Seal Beach, Salon Meritage A gunman enraged over a custody dispute kills his ex-wife and six others inside a salon in the Orange County coastal town, then an eighth victim in the parking lot on Oct. 12, 2011. He is later arrested. The salon, under the same name and owned by a former worker, opens again in November 2012. A memorial to the victims is in Seal Beach’s Eisenhower Park, overlooking the ocean. Aurora, Colo., Century 16 movie theater Twelve people are killed and 70 wounded on July 20, 2012, when a gunman armed with an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and two .40-caliber handguns opens fire on an audience gathered for a midnight screening of the Batman film “The Dark Knight Rises.” The shooter is arrested outside the theater. Renamed the Century Aurora 16, the renovated and repaired theater reopens six months after the shooting. Newtown, Conn., Sandy Hook Elementary School On Dec. 14, 2012, 20 children and six adults are murdered by a 20-year-old man, who kills himself. The gunman also killed his mother. The surviving children are moved to classes at a nearby middle school that had been closed. Sandy Hook Elementary is bulldozed. A new school is scheduled to open this year.

31,http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-gun-control-press-conference-watch-live-stream-white-house-announcement-2249543,"UPDATE: 12:35 p.m. EST — President Barack Obama wiped away tears as he spoke Tuesday at a news conference announcing executive actions on gun control. Obama addressed critics and invoked American citizens' constitutional rights as he outlined his plans to make the nation safer. ""Our right to worship freely and safely — that right was denied to Christians in Charleston, South Carolina. It was denied to Jews in Kansas City. It was denied to Muslims in Chapel Hill and Sikhs in Oak Creek. They had rights too,"" he said, adding that victims were robbed of rights in places like Littleton, Colorado, and Lafayette, Louisiana. He brought up the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, multiple times. ""Every time I think about those kids it gets me mad,"" Obama said. His executive actions include initiatives to help diagnose and treat mentally ill people, improve gun technology so kids can't access the weapons, and ensure the background check system is comprehensive. With a nod to the 2016 presidential race, Obama called on viewers to take political action and ""demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies."" ""We need voters who want safer gun laws and who are disappointed in leaders who stand in their way to remember come election time,"" he added. Some Republican leaders called Obama’s plan unnecessary, while Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said she would build on his efforts. Thank you, @POTUS, for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next president has to build on that progress—not rip it away. -H   Can&#39;t think of a single incident of recent gun violence that Pres Obama&#39;s executive order would have stopped.   President Obama&#39;s words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty. https://t.co/C3UpiNiDop #2A  House Speaker Paul Ryan released a statement blasting Obama's announcement of his executive order to restrict American gun ownership. His full statement is below: ""From day one, the president has never respected the right to safe and legal gun ownership that our nation has valued since its founding. He knows full well that the law already says that people who make their living selling firearms must be licensed, regardless of venue. Still, rather than focus on criminals and terrorists, he goes after the most law-abiding of citizens. His words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty. ""No matter what President Obama says, his word does not trump the Second Amendment. We will conduct vigilant oversight. His executive order will no doubt be challenged in the courts. Ultimately, everything the president has done can be overturned by a Republican president, which is another reason we must win in November. ""We know that the president wants to spend this year offering distractions from his failed record. We will not allow this strategy to take us off course from giving the American people a clear choice with a bold policy agenda.""  UPDATE: 12:11 p.m. EST — President Barack Obama took aim at Congress Tuesday in a speech announcing executive action on gun violence. He criticized lawmakers for rejecting a 2013 bill that would have expanded background checks for people trying to buy firearms, then indicted them for limiting research into gun violence such as the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. ""Even after San Bernardino, they refused to make it harder for terror suspects, who can't get on a plane, to buy semiautomatic weapons. That's not right. That can't be right,"" Obama said. ""The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they don't have to hold America hostage."" He revealed he planned to force anybody selling firearms to be licensed and require background checks or be subject to criminal prosecution. Obama also planned to expand the background check system. Republicans blasted Obama during the speech on Twitter for taking aim at Second Amendment rights. The constitution is the foundation of our government, and I will not sit back and let this president pick and choose which parts to uphold New guns laws, shoved down our throats through executive action, won&#39;t reduce mass violence in our country.  UPDATE: 12:02 p.m. EST — Speaking Tuesday at a news conference to announce executive action on gun control, U.S. President Barack Obama assured Americans he supported the Constitution's Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. But he said he thought he could reduce gun violence while preserving that right. ""This is not a plot to take away everybody's guns,"" Obama said. ""You pass a background check, you purchase a firearm. The problem is, some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules."" The president noted that people buying weapons online or at gun shows do not undergo background checks, then cited several Republican lawmakers who had supported expanding such a system in the past. He lamented partisanship, asking ""How did we get here?"" RT if you stand with @POTUS and support common-sense gun safety legislation to keep Americans safe. #StopGunViolence pic.twitter.com/fHIfhDyTpK .@POTUS thank you for taking action to #StopGunViolence pic.twitter.com/QBX4ggR4Ib  UPDATE 11:52 a.m. EDT — At a Tuesday news conference announcing executive action on gun control, U.S. President Barack Obama was introduced by Mark Barden, the father of 7-year-old Daniel, who was killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Barden noted that he'd introduced the president before, in 2013, after a bill failed to close a loophole in the background check system for firearms. ""We are better. We're better than this,"" Barden said. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden entered the press conference shortly after 11:40 a.m. EST. Obama opened by mentioning the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and cited locations of mass shootings in the U.S. since then, including Aurora, Colorado; Newtown, Connecticut; Santa Barbara, California; and Charleston, South Carolina. ""America is not inherently more prone to violence, but we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency,"" Obama said. Original story: U.S. President Barack Obama is scheduled Tuesday to give details of a plan to toughen the nation’s gun control laws through a series of executive actions. Following a year of several high-profile mass shootings, Obama said he will wield the authority of his office this year to reduce the national rate of gun violence without action by Congress. The president was expected to hold a press conference in the East Room of the White House at 11:40 a.m. EST. Watch a live stream of Obama’s remarks in the player below or click here.  The White House released Monday an outline of the president’s executive actions, on which he consulted with the nation’s top law enforcement leaders, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch of the Department of Justice and James Comey, director of the FBI. Before leaving for his holiday vacation, Obama asked the leaders to recommend actions he could take without asking Congress to send him a bill to sign. The president’s executive actions seek to clarify existing laws that require gun sellers — meaning anyone who makes a living by selling firearms online or at gun shows — to register as a licensed dealer and conduct background checks on all customers. Determining who qualifies as a seller will be based on a how transactions are processed and whether space is rented at gun shows, among other criteria. There will be criminal penalties for those who try to subvert the new requirements, according to the White House. Obama’s gun control plan includes added resources for the FBI, which runs its own background check system, and an additional 230 enforcement agents. The administration also plans to increase access to mental healthcare information in background checks for those who are banned from owning guns for mental health reasons. The executive actions signaled the president’s loss of patience over the lack of legislation regarding gun violence and gun control from Congress, advocates have said. Three years ago, Obama tried to include sweeping changes after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Congress would not get behind a proposal that would have closed loopholes allowing tens of thousands of guns to be sold  online and at gun shows without background checks.

33,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/131528999/0/phoenix/nation~I-know-the-pain-Obama-announces-executive-actions-on-gun-control/,"WASHINGTON — President Obama announced a series of executive actions on guns Tuesday, focusing on the victims of gun violence in a White House event intended to prod Congress to take further action. Speaking to an East Room audience packed with the families of gun violence victims, gun owners and gun control advocates, an often emotional Obama broke into tears when talking about the 20 first-graders gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut three years ago. ""First graders,"" he said, pausing to wipe away tears and compose himself. ""Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad."" The executive actions — first previewed by the White House on Monday — would attempt to clamp down on unlicensed gun sellers who exploit an exception for hobbyists and collectors in order to avoid having to run criminal background checks on gun purchasers. Many of those sellers, Obama said, are running a business by selling guns at gun shows and online. ""The problem is that some gun sellers have been operating by a different set of rules,"" he said. ""That doesn't make sense."" Obama said the administration is also beefing up enforcement, streamlining the background check system, investing $500 million in mental health care and researching ""smart gun"" technology. ""If a child can't open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure they can’t pull a trigger on a gun,"" he said. USA TODAY Republican 2016 candidates bash Obama's gun plan Obama said the actions he's taking are consistent with gun rights. ""I believe in the Second Amendment. It’s there written on paper. It guarantees the right to bear arms. No matter how much people try to twist my words around, I taught constitutional law. I know a little bit about this. I get it,"" he said. ""This is not a plot to take away everybody's guns."" But Obama argued that just like the First Amendment doesn't allow someone to yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater, there are common-sense measures that could keep guns out out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And he argued that Second Amendment rights shouldn't infringe on the rights of people to safely worship in Christian churches, Jewish synagogues, Sikh temples and Muslim mosques — all of which have been targets of gun violence in recent years. ""They had rights, too,"" he said. USA TODAY It's OK to cry: Presidential tears aren't unusual Congressional Republicans had a mixed reaction to Obama's announcement. “The president’s actions are out of bounds and vastly exceed his executive authority,"" said House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who promised vigorous oversight hearings. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called the additional guidance on firearms licenses a ""weak gesture"" that falls short of what Obama really wanted to accomplish. Obama called on Americans to ""demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies."" ""Instead of focusing on how to solve the problem, this has become one of out most polarized, partisan debates,"" Obama said a tone that moved from exasperation to incredulity. ""How did we get here?

36,http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-crying-video-talking-about-sandy-hook-massacre-has-brought-tears-presidents-2250083,"The tears he shed Tuesday during a speech announcing executive actions on gun control were hardly the first time U.S. President Barack Obama, usually emotionally contained, shed tears over gun violence. He also cried more than three years earlier, for the 20 schoolchildren killed in the December 2012 mass shooting at  Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and analysts have started to point out that gun control is a topic that renders Obama remarkably and publicly emotional. You can watch the relevant section of Obama's speech Tuesday below. ""Every time I think about those kids — it gets me mad,"" he said, his eyes red-rimmed as he repeatedly flicked tears from his cheeks with his finger.  Frustrated by the lack of congressional action on gun control,  especially after numerous mass shootings in the past few years -- there were more than 330 in 2015 alone -- Obama announced a series of executive actions Tuesday to expand and improve background checks to cut down on the illegal sale of firearms and guns and reduce gun violence. ""We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency. It doesn't happen in other advanced countries. It's not even close,"" he said, adding, ""We start to feel that this is normal. And instead of thinking about how to solve the problem, this has become one of our most polarized, partisan debates."" The president's unusual display of emotion Tuesday spurred headlines and analysis of how mass killings and gun violence have led Obama to let go of his ordinary stoicism. ""On one issue -- guns -- President Barack Obama lets the public mask slip, revealing the ire boiling within,"" wrote CNN's Stephen Collinson Tuesday after the president's speech. In December 2012, after a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School left 26 people dead, including 20 children, Obama was tearful as he called for action to prevent future deaths to gun violence. ""The majority of those who died today were children -- beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old,"" Obama said at the time. ""They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own."" You can watch that speech here:  He also cried when discussing the death of VP Joe Biden's son, Beau, earlier this year, and he has cried in the public eye even before he became president. During his campaign in 2008, he shed tears while speaking about his grandmother, who had just died. A tear runs down the face of then-U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama as he spoke about his grandmother, who had died earlier in the day, during a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Nov. 3, 2008.

40,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/KyB8dhYE7Jk/,"President Barack Obama unveiled a new set of executive actions aimed at limiting gun violence in a press conference Tuesday from the White House. The efforts largely center on more stringent background checks. Here’s a full transcript of his remarks. THE PRESIDENT: Mark, I want to thank you for your introduction. I still remember the first time we met, the time we spent together, and the conversation we had about Daniel. And that changed me that day. And my hope, earnestly, has been that it would change the country. Five years ago this week, a sitting member of Congress and 18 others were shot at, at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona. It wasn’t the first time I had to talk to the nation in response to a mass shooting, nor would it be the last. Fort Hood. Binghamton. Aurora. Oak Creek. Newtown. The Navy Yard. Santa Barbara. Charleston. San Bernardino. Too many. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Too many. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Too many. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Too many. THE PRESIDENT: Thanks to a great medical team and the love of her husband, Mark, my dear friend and colleague, Gabby Giffords, survived. She’s here with us today, with her wonderful mom. (Applause.) Thanks to a great medical team, her wonderful husband, Mark — who, by the way, the last time I met with Mark — this is just a small aside — you may know Mark’s twin brother is in outer space. (Laughter.) He came to the office, and I said, how often are you talking to him? And he says, well, I usually talk to him every day, but the call was coming in right before the meeting so I think I may have not answered his call — (laughter) — which made me feel kind of bad. (Laughter.) That’s a long-distance call. (Laughter.) So I told him if his brother, Scott, is calling today, that he should take it. (Laughter.) Turn the ringer on. (Laughter.) I was there with Gabby when she was still in the hospital, and we didn’t think necessarily at that point that she was going to survive. And that visit right before a memorial — about an hour later Gabby first opened her eyes. And I remember talking to mom about that. But I know the pain that she and her family have endured these past five years, and the rehabilitation and the work and the effort to recover from shattering injuries. And then I think of all the Americans who aren’t as fortunate. Every single year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns — 30,000. Suicides. Domestic violence. Gang shootouts. Accidents. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost brothers and sisters, or buried their own children. Many have had to learn to live with a disability, or learned to live without the love of their life. A number of those people are here today. They can tell you some stories. In this room right here, there are a lot of stories. There’s a lot of heartache. There’s a lot of resilience, there’s a lot of strength, but there’s also a lot of pain. And this is just a small sample. The United States of America is not the only country on Earth with violent or dangerous people. We are not inherently more prone to violence. But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency. It doesn’t happen in other advanced countries. It’s not even close. And as I’ve said before, somehow we’ve become numb to it and we start thinking that this is normal. And instead of thinking about how to solve the problem, this has become one of our most polarized, partisan debates — despite the fact that there’s a general consensus in America about what needs to be done. That’s part of the reason why, on Thursday, I’m going to hold a town hall meeting in Virginia on gun violence. Because my goal here is to bring good people on both sides of this issue together for an open discussion. I’m not on the ballot again. I’m not looking to score some points. I think we can disagree without impugning other people’s motives or without being disagreeable. We don’t need to be talking past one another. But we do have to feel a sense of urgency about it. In Dr. King’s words, we need to feel the “fierce urgency of now.” Because people are dying. And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do, no longer suffice. That’s why we’re here today. Not to debate the last mass shooting, but to do something to try to prevent the next one. (Applause.) To prove that the vast majority of Americans, even if our voices aren’t always the loudest or most extreme, care enough about a little boy like Daniel to come together and take common-sense steps to save lives and protect more of our children. Now, I want to be absolutely clear at the start — and I’ve said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do — I believe in the Second Amendment. It’s there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this — (applause) — I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment. I mean, think about it. We all believe in the First Amendment, the guarantee of free speech, but we accept that you can’t yell “fire” in a theater. We understand there are some constraints on our freedom in order to protect innocent people. We cherish our right to privacy, but we accept that you have to go through metal detectors before being allowed to board a plane. It’s not because people like doing that, but we understand that that’s part of the price of living in a civilized society. And what’s often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners actually agree. A majority of gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking feud from inflicting harm on a massive scale. Today, background checks are required at gun stores. If a father wants to teach his daughter how to hunt, he can walk into a gun store, get a background check, purchase his weapon safely and responsibly. This is not seen as an infringement on the Second Amendment. Contrary to the claims of what some gun rights proponents have suggested, this hasn’t been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation. Contrary to claims of some presidential candidates, apparently, before this meeting, this is not a plot to take away everybody’s guns. You pass a background check; you purchase a firearm. The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked. A recent study found that about one in 30 people looking to buy guns on one website had criminal records — one out of 30 had a criminal record. We’re talking about individuals convicted of serious crimes — aggravated assault, domestic violence, robbery, illegal gun possession. People with lengthy criminal histories buying deadly weapons all too easily. And this was just one website within the span of a few months. So we’ve created a system in which dangerous people are allowed to play by a different set of rules than a responsible gun owner who buys his or her gun the right way and subjects themselves to a background check. That doesn’t make sense. Everybody should have to abide by the same rules. Most Americans and gun owners agree. And that’s what we tried to change three years ago, after 26 Americans -– including 20 children -– were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary. Two United States Senators -– Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, both gun owners, both strong defenders of our Second Amendment rights, both with “A” grades from the NRA –- that’s hard to get — worked together in good faith, consulting with folks like our Vice President, who has been a champion on this for a long time, to write a common-sense compromise bill that would have required virtually everyone who buys a gun to get a background check. That was it. Pretty common-sense stuff. Ninety percent of Americans supported that idea. Ninety percent of Democrats in the Senate voted for that idea. But it failed because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate voted against that idea. How did this become such a partisan issue? Republican President George W. Bush once said, “I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don’t get into the hands of people that shouldn’t have them.” Senator John McCain introduced a bipartisan measure to address the gun show loophole, saying, “We need this amendment because criminals and terrorists have exploited and are exploiting this very obvious loophole in our gun safety laws.” Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. And by the way, most of its members still do. Most Republican voters still do. How did we get here? How did we get to the place where people think requiring a comprehensive background check means taking away people’s guns? Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying. I reject that thinking. (Applause.) We know we can’t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence. Some of you may recall, at the same time that Sandy Hook happened, a disturbed person in China took a knife and tried to kill — with a knife — a bunch of children in China. But most of them survived because he didn’t have access to a powerful weapon. We maybe can’t save everybody, but we could save some. Just as we don’t prevent all traffic accidents but we take steps to try to reduce traffic accidents. As Ronald Reagan once said, if mandatory background checks could save more lives, “it would be well worth making it the law of the land.” The bill before Congress three years ago met that test. Unfortunately, too many senators failed theirs. (Applause.) In fact, we know that background checks make a difference. After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40 percent — 40 percent. (Applause.) Meanwhile, since Missouri repealed a law requiring comprehensive background checks and purchase permits, gun deaths have increased to almost 50 percent higher than the national average. One study found, unsurprisingly, that criminals in Missouri now have easier access to guns. And the evidence tells us that in states that require background checks, law-abiding Americans don’t find it any harder to purchase guns whatsoever. Their guns have not been confiscated. Their rights have not been infringed. And that’s just the information we have access to. With more research, we could further improve gun safety. Just as with more research, we’ve reduced traffic fatalities enormously over the last 30 years. We do research when cars, food, medicine, even toys harm people so that we make them safer. And you know what — research, science — those are good things. They work. (Laughter and applause.) They do. But think about this. When it comes to an inherently deadly weapon — nobody argues that guns are potentially deadly — weapons that kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, Congress actually voted to make it harder for public health experts to conduct research into gun violence; made it harder to collect data and facts and develop strategies to reduce gun violence. Even after San Bernardino, they’ve refused to make it harder for terror suspects who can’t get on a plane to buy semi-automatic weapons. That’s not right. That can’t be right. So the gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they cannot hold America hostage. (Applause.) We do not have to accept this carnage as the price of freedom. (Applause.) Now, I want to be clear. Congress still needs to act. The folks in this room will not rest until Congress does. (Applause.) Because once Congress gets on board with common-sense gun safety measures we can reduce gun violence a whole lot more. But we also can’t wait. Until we have a Congress that’s in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence and save more lives -– actions that protect our rights and our kids. After Sandy Hook, Joe and I worked together with our teams and we put forward a whole series of executive actions to try to tighten up the existing rules and systems that we had in place. But today, we want to take it a step further. So let me outline what we’re going to be doing. Number one, anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks, or be subject to criminal prosecutions. (Applause.) It doesn’t matter whether you’re doing it over the Internet or at a gun show. It’s not where you do it, but what you do. We’re also expanding background checks to cover violent criminals who try to buy some of the most dangerous firearms by hiding behind trusts and corporations and various cutouts. We’re also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient. Under the guidance of Jim Comey and the FBI, our Deputy Director Tom Brandon at ATF, we’re going to hire more folks to process applications faster, and we’re going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century. (Applause.) And these steps will actually lead to a smoother process for law-abiding gun owners, a smoother process for responsible gun dealers, a stronger process for protecting the people from — the public from dangerous people. So that’s number one. Number two, we’re going to do everything we can to ensure the smart and effective enforcement of gun safety laws that are already on the books, which means we’re going to add 200 more ATF agents and investigators. We’re going to require firearms dealers to report more lost or stolen guns on a timely basis. We’re working with advocates to protect victims of domestic abuse from gun violence, where too often — (applause) — where too often, people are not getting the protection that they need. Number three, we’re going to do more to help those suffering from mental illness get the help that they need. (Applause.) High-profile mass shootings tend to shine a light on those few mentally unstable people who inflict harm on others. But the truth is, is that nearly two in three gun deaths are from suicides. So a lot of our work is to prevent people from hurting themselves. That’s why we made sure that the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — (laughter and applause) — that law made sure that treatment for mental health was covered the same as treatment for any other illness. And that’s why we’re going to invest $500 million to expand access to treatment across the country. (Applause.) It’s also why we’re going to ensure that federal mental health records are submitted to the background check system, and remove barriers that prevent states from reporting relevant information. If we can continue to de-stigmatize mental health issues, get folks proper care, and fill gaps in the background check system, then we can spare more families the pain of losing a loved one to suicide. And for those in Congress who so often rush to blame mental illness for mass shootings as a way of avoiding action on guns, here’s your chance to support these efforts. Put your money where your mouth is. (Applause.) Number four, we’re going to boost gun safety technology. Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen or misused or discharged accidentally. In 2013 alone, more than 500 people lost their lives to gun accidents –- and that includes 30 children younger than five years old. In the greatest, most technologically advanced nation on Earth, there is no reason for this. We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer. If we can set it up so you can’t unlock your phone unless you’ve got the right fingerprint, why can’t we do the same thing for our guns? (Applause.) If there’s an app that can help us find a missing tablet — which happens to me often the older I get — (laughter) — if we can do it for your iPad, there’s no reason we can’t do it with a stolen gun. If a child can’t open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure that they can’t pull a trigger on a gun. (Applause.) Right? So we’re going to advance research. We’re going to work with the private sector to update firearms technology. And some gun retailers are already stepping up by refusing to finalize a purchase without a complete background check, or by refraining from selling semi-automatic weapons or high-capacity magazines. And I hope that more retailers and more manufacturers join them — because they should care as much as anybody about a product that now kills almost as many Americans as car accidents. I make this point because none of us can do this alone. I think Mark made that point earlier. All of us should be able to work together to find a balance that declares the rest of our rights are also important — Second Amendment rights are important, but there are other rights that we care about as well. And we have to be able to balance them. Because our right to worship freely and safely –- that right was denied to Christians in Charleston, South Carolina. (Applause.) And that was denied Jews in Kansas City. And that was denied Muslims in Chapel Hill, and Sikhs in Oak Creek. (Applause.) They had rights, too. (Applause.) Our right to peaceful assembly -– that right was robbed from moviegoers in Aurora and Lafayette. Our unalienable right to life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness -– those rights were stripped from college students in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara, and from high schoolers at Columbine, and from first-graders in Newtown. First-graders. And from every family who never imagined that their loved one would be taken from our lives by a bullet from a gun. Every time I think about those kids it gets me mad. And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day. (Applause.) So all of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby’s lies. All of us need to stand up and protect its citizens. All of us need to demand governors and legislatures and businesses do their part to make our communities safer. We need the wide majority of responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time this happens and feel like your views are not being properly represented to join with us to demand something better. (Applause.) And we need voters who want safer gun laws, and who are disappointed in leaders who stand in their way, to remember come election time. (Applause.) I mean, some of this is just simple math. Yes, the gun lobby is loud and it is organized in defense of making it effortless for guns to be available for anybody, any time. Well, you know what, the rest of us, we all have to be just as passionate. We have to be just as organized in defense of our kids. This is not that complicated. The reason Congress blocks laws is because they want to win elections. And if you make it hard for them to win an election if they block those laws, they’ll change course, I promise you. (Applause.) And, yes, it will be hard, and it won’t happen overnight. It won’t happen during this Congress. It won’t happen during my presidency. But a lot of things don’t happen overnight. A woman’s right to vote didn’t happen overnight. The liberation of African Americans didn’t happen overnight. LGBT rights — that was decades’ worth of work. So just because it’s hard, that’s no excuse not to try. And if you have any doubt as to why you should feel that “fierce urgency of now,” think about what happened three weeks ago. Zaevion Dobson was a sophomore at Fulton High School in Knoxville, Tennessee. He played football; beloved by his classmates and his teachers. His own mayor called him one of their city’s success stories. The week before Christmas, he headed to a friend’s house to play video games. He wasn’t in the wrong place at the wrong time. He hadn’t made a bad decision. He was exactly where any other kid would be. Your kid. My kids. And then gunmen started firing. And Zaevion — who was in high school, hadn’t even gotten started in life — dove on top of three girls to shield them from the bullets. And he was shot in the head. And the girls were spared. He gave his life to save theirs –- an act of heroism a lot bigger than anything we should ever expect from a 15-year-old. “Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends.” We are not asked to do what Zaevion Dobson did. We’re not asked to have shoulders that big; a heart that strong; reactions that quick. I’m not asking people to have that same level of courage, or sacrifice, or love. But if we love our kids and care about their prospects, and if we love this country and care about its future, then we can find the courage to vote. We can find the courage to get mobilized and organized. We can find the courage to cut through all the noise and do what a sensible country would do. That’s what we’re doing today. And tomorrow, we should do more. And we should do more the day after that. And if we do, we’ll leave behind a nation that’s stronger than the one we inherited and worthy of the sacrifice of a young man like Zaevion. (Applause.) Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you. God bless America. (Applause.) Contact us at letters@time.com.",2016-01-05 14:14:00,Transcript: Read Barack Obama’s Speech on New Gun Control Measures,,40362,http://www.time.com/time/

42,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/jan/04/obama-steps-up-push-to-rein-in-gun-viol/,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will meet with Attorney General Loretta Lynch today to discuss potential actions to restrain gun violence. Obama is starting his final year in office with new efforts, including potential executive actions that were quickly condemned by Republicans aiming to succeed him. On Thursday, the president will appear at a town-hall-style event at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., to talk about ways to curb gun violence, the White House announced on Sunday. CNN's Anderson Cooper will join Obama for the Guns in America special that will be televised live. The president's focus on gun control has drawn the attention of candidates seeking the Republican presidential nomination. Donald Trump said there were already enough ""rules and regulations"" governing the firearms industry and vowed to reverse any executive actions if elected. ""It's not the gun that pulls the trigger,"" Trump said on CBS News' Face the Nation broadcast Sunday. ""I don't like it. I don't like what he's doing."" ""We have plenty of rules and regulations, there's plenty of things they can do, right now, that are already there, they don't do them,"" Trump said. The billionaire also said the U.S. should focus more on mental health measures to curb gun violence, such as building ""institutions for people that are sickos."" Another Republican presidential hopeful, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said Obama was taking rights away from law-abiding citizens. Bush said that, if elected, he would focus instead on punishing people committing crimes with guns. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Bush called himself the most ""pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment"" governor, and one who cut down gun violence in the state at the same time. Bush added that he believed that gun-control measures should be considered at the state level, rather than the federal level. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, also on Fox News Sunday, called Obama ""a petulant child"" in acting unilaterally to get his way, while Carly Fiorina, former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, told CNN's State of the Union that the president has been ""lawless"" in his use of executive orders. The three major 2016 Democratic candidates for president have called for tougher gun control in the wake of the San Bernardino, Calif., attack, carried out by a married couple who were followers of radical Islam. That includes Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Vermont independent, who has been criticized by rivals Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley for not being tough enough on guns in the past, was one of the 48 senators who voted in favor of West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin's amendment to expand background checks. Sunday, Sanders told ABC News' This Week With George Stephanopolous that what Obama's proposing ""will be the right thing to do."" A ""wide consensus"" of Americans ""believe we should expand and strengthen the instant background check so that people who should not have guns, i.e. criminals or people with mental issues, mental health issues, should not have guns,"" Sanders said. Enacting new gun rules, which the administration promised in December, is part of ""my New Year's resolution to move forward on our unfinished business as much as I can,"" Obama said is his weekly video and radio address, released Friday. The president singled out gun control as a priority, saying federal efforts to limit violence had been stifled by a gun lobby that wields more power in Congress than public opinion warrants. No major gun-control measure has emerged from Washington since a 1994 assault weapons ban, which expired 10 years later and wasn't renewed. Obama unsuccessfully tried for congressional passage of new gun-control laws after the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 young children and six adult staff members were killed. A Senate vote in December to strengthen background checks on gun-buyers -- voted on the day after a mass shooting in San Bernardino killed 14 people -- failed largely along party lines. Nearly all Democrats supported the measures while Republicans, who hold the majority, were mostly opposed. Policy on Cuba The White House will decide within a few months whether Obama marks his final year in office with a trip to communist Cuba, which has been under a U.S. trade embargo for more than 50 years. Rhodes declined on Saturday to make a commitment on an Obama visit, saying that moves need to be taken by both governments to make the opening of relations between the U.S. and Cuba ""irreversible."" Rhodes spoke to reporters in Honolulu hours before Obama flew back to Washington from a family vacation in Hawaii. The U.S. has taken steps to facilitate travel and commerce with Cuba for the first time in decades, though ""there is more we could do,"" Rhodes said. ""On the Cuban side, there are steps they could take over the course of the year that could allow them to absorb greater economic activity,"" Rhodes said, adding that ""nobody expects Cuba in the next year to become a multi-party democracy."" The U.S. and Cuba started to re-establish ties in late 2014. Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro met at the Summit of the Americas in Panama in April 2015, the first meeting between U.S. and Cuban heads of state since 1961. Position on Iran Rhodes also said the U.S. wasn't shifting its position on whether to announce further sanctions on Iran in response to recent ballistic missile launches. ""We have additional work that needs to be done before we would announce additional designations,"" he said. Separately, the U.S. expects Iran in the next few weeks to complete the work necessary to finalize the nuclear deal struck with world powers in July. ""They still have a number of important things they need to do,"" Rhodes said. ""But we are on track to see the implementation of the Iran deal moving forward."" The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the new sanctions may be delayed, citing unidentified U.S. officials. Lawmakers, including some Democrats, have criticized the White House for dragging its heels. ""These recent violations underscore Iran's readiness to test the will of the international community, instigated by its hardline elements that want to scuttle the deal. That challenge must be met with a decisive response,"" Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the second-ranked Democrat in the House, said Saturday in a statement.

44,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/ibitpsZxtAc/,"On Monday evening, President Obama prepped the media by dropping some serious juice on his gun control plan. The White House followed up by publishing some bare bones guidelines, and Tuesday morning saw Obama unveiling his tear-stained, official plan to reduce gun violence. Many eyebrows raised at Obama’s apparent intent to disregard Congress and force an official executive move on gun reform. The president insisted (perhaps as a warning to those who would challenge) that he was well within his authority. Only a few months ago (while addressing the Oregon college shootings), Obama confronted critics who would inevitably accuse him of politicizing mass tragedies. Obama was fine with it: “This is something we should politicize.” As Obama nears the end of his second term, he’s not planning for a future bid for office. Instead, he’s taking action because he wants to “try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence.” During the Tuesday speech, Obama stated his ultimate goal — to prevent the next mass shooting instead of falling into the usual routine of debating the last one. The president ended the speech in tears while discussing Sandy Hook, which reveals not only his sorrow, but also his relief at finally unveiling measures. We have to remember that Obama has truly, in his words, seen “too many” of these tragedies. The San Bernardino shootings marked the 15th time he addressed the nation after a mass shooting. After delivering some harsh data — more than 30,000 Americans die annually from gun violence — Obama said the U.S. should no longer “accept this carnage as the price of freedom.” Obama promised that he’s not working up “a plot to take away everybody’s guns,” but he did admonish Republicans for blocking a 2013 bill (that 90% of the U.S. supported) in the wake of Sandy Hook. Obama won’t wait for Congress this time. He’ll push his gun plan into action, but he knows several provisions will require legislative action before they go into effect. As revealed in Obama’s speech, the official new White House plan contains the following provisions: What doesn’t President Obama’s plan include? There’s no ban on large-capacity magazines, and people on terrorist “no-fly” lists are not prohibited from buying guns. Perhaps these omissions were purely political moves so that the plan can move forward with the least amount of opposition. These key quotes reveal Obama’s unwavering commitment: Obama knows that gun violence won’t stop immediately, and this cause will take a long road similar to women’s rights or LGBT rights. Obama says he won’t refuse to move “just because it’s hard.” He’s ready to get down to business on gun control, and now the ball is rolling.

45,http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/01/05/President-Obamas-full-remarks-on-gun-safety-reform/5571452021742/,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UPI) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday announced a series of actions aiming to curb gun violence in the United States. Here are his full remarks, delivered in the East Room of the White House, after an introduction by Mark Barden, whose young son Daniel was killed in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School:
Advertisement Mark, I want to thank you for your introduction. I still remember the first time we met, the time we spent together, and the conversation we had about Daniel. And that changed me that day. And my hope, earnestly, has been that it would change the country. Five years ago this week, a sitting member of Congress and 18 others were shot at, at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona. It wasn't the first time I had to talk to the nation in response to a mass shooting, nor would it be the last. Fort Hood. Binghamton. Aurora. Oak Creek. Newtown. The Navy Yard. Santa Barbara. Charleston. San Bernardino. Too many.
RELATED Trump says he would veto Obama's executive orders on guns Thanks to a great medical team and the love of her husband, Mark, my dear friend and colleague, Gabby Giffords, survived. She's here with us today, with her wonderful mom. Thanks to a great medical team, her wonderful husband, Mark -- who, by the way, the last time I met with Mark -- this is just a small aside -- you may know Mark's twin brother is in outer space. He came to the office, and I said, how often are you talking to him? And he says, well, I usually talk to him every day, but the call was coming in right before the meeting so I think I may have not answered his call, which made me feel kind of bad. That's a long-distance call. So I told him if his brother, Scott, is calling today, that he should take it. Turn the ringer on.
Advertisement I was there with Gabby when she was still in the hospital, and we didn't think necessarily at that point that she was going to survive. And that visit right before a memorial -- about an hour later Gabby first opened her eyes. And I remember talking to mom about that. But I know the pain that she and her family have endured these past five years, and the rehabilitation and the work and the effort to recover from shattering injuries. And then I think of all the Americans who aren't as fortunate. Every single year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns -- 30,000. Suicides. Domestic violence. Gang shootouts. Accidents. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost brothers and sisters, or buried their own children. Many have had to learn to live with a disability, or learned to live without the love of their life.
RELATED Obama set to hold town hall meeting on gun control A number of those people are here today. They can tell you some stories. In this room right here, there are a lot of stories. There's a lot of heartache. There's a lot of resilience, there's a lot of strength, but there's also a lot of pain. And this is just a small sample.
Advertisement The United States of America is not the only country on Earth with violent or dangerous people. We are not inherently more prone to violence. But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency. It doesn't happen in other advanced countries. It's not even close. And as I've said before, somehow we've become numb to it and we start thinking that this is normal. And instead of thinking about how to solve the problem, this has become one of our most polarized, partisan debates -- despite the fact that there's a general consensus in America about what needs to be done. That's part of the reason why, on Thursday, I'm going to hold a town hall meeting in Virginia on gun violence. Because my goal here is to bring good people on both sides of this issue together for an open discussion. I'm not on the ballot again. I'm not looking to score some points. I think we can disagree without impugning other people's motives or without being disagreeable. We don't need to be talking past one another. But we do have to feel a sense of urgency about it. In Dr. King's words, we need to feel the 'fierce urgency of now.' Because people are dying. And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do, no longer suffice.
Advertisement That's why we're here today. Not to debate the last mass shooting, but to do something to try to prevent the next one. To prove that the vast majority of Americans, even if our voices aren't always the loudest or most extreme, care enough about a little boy like Daniel to come together and take common-sense steps to save lives and protect more of our children. Now, I want to be absolutely clear at the start -- and I've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do -- I believe in the Second Amendment. It's there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around -- I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this -- I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment. I mean, think about it. We all believe in the First Amendment, the guarantee of free speech, but we accept that you can't yell 'fire' in a theater. We understand there are some constraints on our freedom in order to protect innocent people. We cherish our right to privacy, but we accept that you have to go through metal detectors before being allowed to board a plane. It's not because people like doing that, but we understand that that's part of the price of living in a civilized society.
Advertisement And what's often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners actually agree. A majority of gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking feud from inflicting harm on a massive scale. Today, background checks are required at gun stores. If a father wants to teach his daughter how to hunt, he can walk into a gun store, get a background check, purchase his weapon safely and responsibly. This is not seen as an infringement on the Second Amendment. Contrary to the claims of what some gun rights proponents have suggested, this hasn't been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation. Contrary to claims of some presidential candidates, apparently, before this meeting, this is not a plot to take away everybody's guns. You pass a background check; you purchase a firearm. The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked. A recent study found that about 1 in 30 people looking to buy guns on one website had criminal records -- 1 out of 30 had a criminal record. We're talking about individuals convicted of serious crimes -- aggravated assault, domestic violence, robbery, illegal gun possession. People with lengthy criminal histories buying deadly weapons all too easily. And this was just one website within the span of a few months.
Advertisement So we've created a system in which dangerous people are allowed to play by a different set of rules than a responsible gun owner who buys his or her gun the right way and subjects themselves to a background check. That doesn't make sense. Everybody should have to abide by the same rules. Most Americans and gun owners agree. And that's what we tried to change three years ago, after 26 Americans -– including 20 children -– were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary. Two United States Senators -– Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, both gun owners, both strong defenders of our Second Amendment rights, both with 'A' grades from the NRA –- that's hard to get -- worked together in good faith, consulting with folks like our vice president, who has been a champion on this for a long time, to write a common-sense compromise bill that would have required virtually everyone who buys a gun to get a background check. That was it. Pretty common-sense stuff. Ninety percent of Americans supported that idea. Ninety percent of Democrats in the Senate voted for that idea. But it failed because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate voted against that idea.
Advertisement How did this become such a partisan issue? Republican President George W. Bush once said, 'I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get into the hands of people that shouldn't have them.' Sen. John McCain introduced a bipartisan measure to address the gun show loophole, saying, 'We need this amendment because criminals and terrorists have exploited and are exploiting this very obvious loophole in our gun safety laws.' Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. And by the way, most of its members still do. Most Republican voters still do. How did we get here? How did we get to the place where people think requiring a comprehensive background check means taking away people's guns? Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying. I reject that thinking. We know we can't stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence.
Advertisement Some of you may recall, at the same time that Sandy Hook happened, a disturbed person in China took a knife and tried to kill -- with a knife -- a bunch of children in China. But most of them survived because he didn't have access to a powerful weapon. We maybe can't save everybody, but we could save some. Just as we don't prevent all traffic accidents but we take steps to try to reduce traffic accidents. As Ronald Reagan once said, if mandatory background checks could save more lives, 'it would be well worth making it the law of the land.' The bill before Congress three years ago met that test. Unfortunately, too many senators failed theirs. In fact, we know that background checks make a difference. After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40 percent -- 40 percent. Meanwhile, since Missouri repealed a law requiring comprehensive background checks and purchase permits, gun deaths have increased to almost 50 percent higher than the national average. One study found, unsurprisingly, that criminals in Missouri now have easier access to guns. And the evidence tells us that in states that require background checks, law-abiding Americans don't find it any harder to purchase guns whatsoever. Their guns have not been confiscated. Their rights have not been infringed.
Advertisement And that's just the information we have access to. With more research, we could further improve gun safety. Just as with more research, we've reduced traffic fatalities enormously over the last 30 years. We do research when cars, food, medicine, even toys harm people so that we make them safer. And you know what -- research, science -- those are good things. They work. They do. But think about this. When it comes to an inherently deadly weapon -- nobody argues that guns are potentially deadly -- weapons that kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, Congress actually voted to make it harder for public health experts to conduct research into gun violence; made it harder to collect data and facts and develop strategies to reduce gun violence. Even after San Bernardino, they've refused to make it harder for terror suspects who can't get on a plane to buy semi-automatic weapons. That's not right. That can't be right. So the gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they cannot hold America hostage. We do not have to accept this carnage as the price of freedom. Now, I want to be clear. Congress still needs to act. The folks in this room will not rest until Congress does. Because once Congress gets on board with common-sense gun safety measures we can reduce gun violence a whole lot more. But we also can't wait. Until we have a Congress that's in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence and save more lives -– actions that protect our rights and our kids.
Advertisement After Sandy Hook, Joe and I worked together with our teams and we put forward a whole series of executive actions to try to tighten up the existing rules and systems that we had in place. But today, we want to take it a step further. So let me outline what we're going to be doing. No. 1, anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks, or be subject to criminal prosecutions. It doesn't matter whether you're doing it over the Internet or at a gun show. It's not where you do it, but what you do. We're also expanding background checks to cover violent criminals who try to buy some of the most dangerous firearms by hiding behind trusts and corporations and various cutouts. We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient. Under the guidance of Jim Comey and the FBI, our Deputy Director Tom Brandon at ATF, we're going to hire more folks to process applications faster, and we're going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century. And these steps will actually lead to a smoother process for law-abiding gun owners, a smoother process for responsible gun dealers, a stronger process for protecting the people from -- the public from dangerous people. So that's No. 1.
Advertisement No. 2, we're going to do everything we can to ensure the smart and effective enforcement of gun safety laws that are already on the books, which means we're going to add 200 more ATF agents and investigators. We're going to require firearms dealers to report more lost or stolen guns on a timely basis. We're working with advocates to protect victims of domestic abuse from gun violence, where too often -- where too often, people are not getting the protection that they need. No. 3, we're going to do more to help those suffering from mental illness get the help that they need. High-profile mass shootings tend to shine a light on those few mentally unstable people who inflict harm on others. But the truth is, is that nearly 2 in 3 gun deaths are from suicides. So a lot of our work is to prevent people from hurting themselves. That's why we made sure that the Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- that law made sure that treatment for mental health was covered the same as treatment for any other illness. And that's why we're going to invest $500 million to expand access to treatment across the country.
Advertisement It's also why we're going to ensure that federal mental health records are submitted to the background check system and remove barriers that prevent states from reporting relevant information. If we can continue to destigmatize mental health issues, get folks proper care and fill gaps in the background check system, then we can spare more families the pain of losing a loved one to suicide. And for those in Congress who so often rush to blame mental illness for mass shootings as a way of avoiding action on guns, here's your chance to support these efforts. Put your money where your mouth is. No. 4, we're going to boost gun safety technology. Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen or misused or discharged accidentally. In 2013 alone, more than 500 people lost their lives to gun accidents –- and that includes 30 children younger than 5 years old. In the greatest, most technologically advanced nation on Earth, there is no reason for this. We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer. If we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you've got the right fingerprint, why can't we do the same thing for our guns? If there's an app that can help us find a missing tablet -- which happens to me often the older I get -- if we can do it for your iPad, there's no reason we can't do it with a stolen gun. If a child can't open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure that they can't pull a trigger on a gun. Right?
Advertisement So we're going to advance research. We're going to work with the private sector to update firearms technology. And some gun retailers are already stepping up by refusing to finalize a purchase without a complete background check, or by refraining from selling semi-automatic weapons or high-capacity magazines. And I hope that more retailers and more manufacturers join them -- because they should care as much as anybody about a product that now kills almost as many Americans as car accidents. I make this point because none of us can do this alone. I think Mark made that point earlier. All of us should be able to work together to find a balance that declares the rest of our rights are also important -- Second Amendment rights are important, but there are other rights that we care about, as well. And we have to be able to balance them. Because our right to worship freely and safely –- that right was denied to Christians in Charleston, S.C. And that was denied Jews in Kansas City. And that was denied Muslims in Chapel Hill, and Sikhs in Oak Creek. They had rights, too. Our right to peaceful assembly -– that right was robbed from moviegoers in Aurora and Lafayette. Our unalienable right to life, and liberty and the pursuit of happiness -– those rights were stripped from college students in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara, and from high-schoolers at Columbine, and from first-graders in Newtown. First-graders. And from every family who never imagined that their loved one would be taken from our lives by a bullet from a gun.
Advertisement Every time I think about those kids it gets me mad. And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day. So all of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies. All of us need to stand up and protect its citizens. All of us need to demand governors and legislatures and businesses do their part to make our communities safer. We need the wide majority of responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time this happens and feel like your views are not being properly represented to join with us to demand something better. And we need voters who want safer gun laws, and who are disappointed in leaders who stand in their way, to remember come election time. I mean, some of this is just simple math. Yes, the gun lobby is loud, and it is organized in defense of making it effortless for guns to be available for anybody, any time. Well, you know what, the rest of us, we all have to be just as passionate. We have to be just as organized in defense of our kids. This is not that complicated. The reason Congress blocks laws is because they want to win elections. And if you make it hard for them to win an election if they block those laws, they'll change course, I promise you. )
Advertisement And, yes, it will be hard, and it won't happen overnight. It won't happen during this Congress. It won't happen during my presidency. But a lot of things don't happen overnight. A woman's right to vote didn't happen overnight. The liberation of African Americans didn't happen overnight. LGBT rights -- that was decades' worth of work. So just because it's hard, that's no excuse not to try. And if you have any doubt as to why you should feel that 'fierce urgency of now,' think about what happened three weeks ago. Zaevion Dobson was a sophomore at Fulton High School in Knoxville, Tenn. He played football; beloved by his classmates and his teachers. His own mayor called him one of their city's success stories. The week before Christmas, he headed to a friend's house to play video games. He wasn't in the wrong place at the wrong time. He hadn't made a bad decision. He was exactly where any other kid would be. Your kid. My kids. And then gunmen started firing. And Zaevion -- who was in high school, hadn't even gotten started in life -- dove on top of three girls to shield them from the bullets. And he was shot in the head. And the girls were spared. He gave his life to save theirs –- an act of heroism a lot bigger than anything we should ever expect from a 15-year-old. 'Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends.'
Advertisement We are not asked to do what Zaevion Dobson did. We're not asked to have shoulders that big; a heart that strong; reactions that quick. I'm not asking people to have that same level of courage, or sacrifice, or love. But if we love our kids and care about their prospects, and if we love this country and care about its future, then we can find the courage to vote. We can find the courage to get mobilized and organized. We can find the courage to cut through all the noise and do what a sensible country would do. That's what we're doing today. And tomorrow, we should do more. And we should do more the day after that. And if we do, we'll leave behind a nation that's stronger than the one we inherited and worthy of the sacrifice of a young man like Zaevion. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.

47,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/131570231/0/phoenix/local~infamous-mass-shootings-in-Arizona/,"Here is a look at five mass shootings in Arizona's recent past. And although there isn't an official definition for a mass shooting, The Republic and azcentral used the Congressional Research Service's definition: four or more people killed with a firearm, not including the perpetrator. Murdered: Nine people — six Buddhist monks, a nun and two students When: Aug. 10, 1991 Where: Wat Promkunaram Temple in Waddell The story: Nine victims were found lying face down in a temple room on Aug. 10, 1991. The victims had been shot execution-style. Some had their hands clasped in prayer. The room's carpet was bloody from head wounds made by .22-caliber bullets and shotgun blasts to torsos, arms and legs. Johnathan Doody and Allessandro ""Alex"" Garcia were arrested in connection with the Buddhist Temple shootings. Garcia plead guilty to avoid the death penalty and was sentenced to 271 years in prison. Doody was convicted of murder and sentenced to 281 years in prison. Because of an allegedly forced confession, Doody's conviction was overturned in 2008 and again in 2011 by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Doody went back on trial in August 2013, which resulted in a mistrial. In 2014, Doody was found guilty of nine counts of first-degree murder, nine counts of armed robbery and one count each of burglary and conspiracy to commit armed robbery. He was sent back to prison. AZCENTRAL Shocking murders in metro Phoenix history Murdered: Tammy Lovell, Jacob Lovell, Cassandra Lovell, Steven Duffy and Shane Duffy When: Feb. 21, 2006 Where: Mesa The story:William Craig Miller killed five people in an attempt to cover up his involvement in an arson-for-hire case. Steven Duffy and his girlfriend, Tammy Lovell, were set to testify against Miller and had helped Scottsdale police in the arson investigation. Duffy had helped Miller burn his home in Scottsdale. Miller shot Duffy and Lovell execution-style before killing Lovell's children, Jacob and Cassandra, and Duffy's younger brother, Shane. Miller was convicted in 2011 and sentenced to death. Murdered: Six people, with an additional 13 wounded, including Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords When: Jan. 8, 2011 Where: Safeway parking lot in Tucson area The story:  At about 10 a.m. on Jan. 8. 2011, a gunman fired 31 shots in 15 seconds, killing six people and wounding 13, including then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, approached Giffords while she was hosting a ""Congress in your Corner"" meeting in a Safeway parking lot. Loughner shot Giffords in the head and proceeded to fire on others. Loughner  was dragged to the ground and disarmed by witnesses. He was indicted on 49 felony counts and, after a legal battle over his mental competence, pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty. He was sentenced to multiple life prison terms without the possibility of parole. Murdered: Lisa Mederos, Amber Mederos, Lilly Mederos and Jim Hiott When: May 2, 2012 Where: Lisa Mederos' home in Gilbert The story: On a May afternoon in 2012, a shooting rampage at a home in a sedate Gilbert neighborhood left four adults and a toddler dead. Avowed White supremacist Jason Todd ""J.T."" Ready had killed his girlfriend and members of her family before taking his own life. Police reports later indicated that Ready and his girlfriend, Lisa, had been arguing the night of May 1, then again the next day about noon. Ready accused Lisa of breaking something he owned. Lisa's daughter, Amber, arrived with her daughter, Lilly, and fiance, Jim,  and the gunshots started. Police believe Ready shot his victims and then himself within less than a minute. Murdered: Five Phoenix family members When: April 16, 2015 Where: The family's north Phoenix home The story: A business dispute sent a family's middle brother into a rage that left four relatives dead before he turned the gun on himself in the home they shared. Driss Diaeddinn, 50, killed his two brothers, sister-in-law and mother before killing himself. Witnesses said the murder-suicide was the result of a dispute over the family-owned limousine service.

49,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/05/san-bernardino-shooting-fbi-investigation-public-help,"Seeking information about the couple’s movements, law enforcement officials hope to determine a motive in the 2 December shooting that left 14 dead Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.18 BST The FBI appealed to the public for help on Tuesday in filling in 18 minutes missing from the timeline of last month’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, saying they hoped new information would shed light on the attackers’ motivations. Law enforcement hopes that the missing timeframe will “determine the motivation of Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife”, FBI assistant director in charge David Bowdich said at a news conference at the San Bernardino Police Department.  “We have accounted for three hours and 42 minutes of time,” he said. “We are missing 18 minutes of time.” “Why is that important? We want to know if they stopped at any residences, businesses or locations that we don’t already know about, or if they contacted anyone,” Bowdich said. “As we’ve said before, there will be no stone left unturned. This is not an average investigation.” The missing time begins at 12.59pm and ends at 1.17pm 2 December, after Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, stormed the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, killing 14 people and wounding 20. During that time, authorities say, the shooters zig-zagged across a patch of territory from Redlands to San Bernardino, parking and stopping at different places. “If the public has any media, witnessed any sightings, we want to have the information,” Bowdich said. The FBI also provided new information in the timeline – constructed from “traffic cameras, surveillance cameras, and witness accounts”, Bowdich said – for the hours before the attack. According to law enforcement, Farook left his house at 8.37am, arriving at the center at 8.47am At 10.37am he left the center, leaving behind a backpack he had been wearing that contained pipe bombs. About 19 minutes later, Farook returned to the center with his wife and the attack ensued over the next few minutes. At 11.45am the couple drove to Seccombe Lake, in which they tossed objects later recovered by the FBI and which Bowdich deemed “not relevant”. The FBI also continued to dismiss the idea othat Farook and Malik were affiliated with a foreign militant group. “As of today, we do not see any indication of a foreign-directed terrorist act. Seems to be an inspired terrorist attack,” Bowdich said. He did not have a direct explanation for the shooters’ motivations and said there was no evidence to any workplace dispute, adding that Farook had posed for pictures with colleagues before the shooting. “Obviously they were heavily armed. We don’t know of any secondary targets but it’s certainly not beyond the realm of possibility.” Bowdich added that the FBI had completed more than 550 interviews, collected more than 500 pieces of evidence, executed 29 search warrants and scoured social media to ascertain the motivation. Farook’s childhood neighbor, Enrique Marquez, who has been charged with supplying the weapons used in the attacks, will be arraigned on Wednesday in US district court in Riverside. He remains in federal custody after being denied bail and is expected to plead not guilty. However, he spoke freely to the FBI without a lawyer for 11 consecutive days before being charged and confessed to buying the guns and entering a sham marriage with Farook’s brother’s wife’s sister for her to receive a green card, according to charging documents. The center reopened Monday, with a newly erected fence and patrolled security for the first time since the attack.",2016-01-05 17:29:06,FBI appeals for help to fill in 18 missing minutes of San Bernardino timeline,"crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

So the new federal regulations could help stem the flow of firearms into the Golden State. “States with weak gun laws and no (universal) background check requirement are a major source of crime guns here in California,” said Ari Freilich, an attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in San Francisco. “Though California law regulates the importation of firearms from out of state, unscrupulous individuals can too easily obtain firearms in neighboring states without a background check and bring those firearms into California.” Federal data paints only a partial picture of that flow, largely because of the lack of universal background checks in other states. When California police want to trace the origin of a firearm that was used or suspected to have been used in a crime, they call the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In 2014, the ATF was able to determine where 21,267 of those firearms came from. And 2,452 were first sold in Arizona, Nevada and Texas. Each weapon was traced back to a federally licensed firearms dealer who was legally required to do a background check when selling it for the first time. But guns first sold with background checks later might be sold again without checks in other states before the weapons end up in California, said Special Agent Helen Dunkel, spokeswoman for the ATF’s San Francisco office. Some of those private-party sales in other states will now require background checks under Obama’s new plan, and every background check is an opportunity to keep a firearm out of the hands of a criminal or mentally ill person, she said. “It affects our state,” Dunkel said. But Chuck Michel, attorney for the California Rifle and Pistol Association, said Obama’s action will do little more than “harass” Americans who want to sell their firearm collections or sell firearms to their friends and neighbors. “It’s not going to stop a criminal from getting one, and it sure as hell isn’t going to stop a terrorist from getting one,” Michel said. “They’ll steal it or smuggle it in from Mexico or get someone else to buy it for them.” Gov. Jerry Brown made headlines last month by saying that Arizona and other states with “wide open” gun laws are a “gigantic back door through which any terrorist can walk.” He made the comment after 14 people were killed and 22 were seriously injured in a terrorist mass shooting in San Bernardino. However, the rifles used in that massacre were bought years earlier, with background checks, by an associate of the shooters. A federal grand jury has indicted that “straw purchaser” on charges of providing material support to terrorists and making false statements about being the actual buyer. Brown declined to comment on Obama’s action Tuesday. But Kristin Ford, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Kamala Harris, said the Golden State “has led the way in enacting strong gun violence reduction measures, but this is a national problem that needs federal solutions.” Obama’s actions, she added, “will prevent criminals and others prohibited from possessing guns from bypassing background checks.” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch sent a letter Tuesday to Brown and other governors urging more cooperation in providing timely information to the FBI’s National Instant Background Check System (NICS) and praising the 13 “point of contact” states — including California — where state agencies conduct the federal checks on behalf of sellers. Obama’s other gun proposals also include doubling the FBI staff that conducts background checks, and investing more money in updating the 1990s-era computer system so that it can do checks around the clock. It seemed to be the one proposal that both sides in the gun control debate agreed on. Michel said the National Rifle Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and other gun-rights groups for many years have called for improving NICS, and they support Obama’s plan to do so now. But improving NICS so that it’s faster and has more up-to-date records means California should get out of the background-check business, Michel said. Right now, California dealers provide gun sale information to the state Department of Justice, which then queries NICS and other databases to determine whether buyers are allowed to possess firearms. “The state charges a gun owner $25 roughly to do a background check that could be done for free by the feds,” he said, claiming the state’s criminal and mental-health databases are a mess anyway. “The real question now that ought to be asked is why does California need to have this state database — it’s completely redundant.” But in her letter to governors, Lynch wrote that states like California which do their own checks often have access to more mental health, drug abuse and other records than NICS. Also, the states’ own criminal records are more likely to be up to date, she wrote, and states are better equipped to figure out whether any of their own state laws prohibit someone from buying a gun.

X OUR PICKS: WASHINGTON — Summoning the ghosts of nearly two dozen children killed three years ago in their Connecticut classrooms, President Barack Obama said Tuesday that he was pressing ahead with new firearms restrictions unilaterally because the level of gun violence in the United States has robbed so many Americans of their basic right to gather safely.
“First-graders, in Newtown,” he said, pausing as he contemplated the 20 children who died along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. “First-graders.”
“And from every family who never imagined that their loved one would be taken from our lives by a bullet,” the president said, pausing again as he flicked away a few tears. “Every time I think about those kids, it makes me mad. And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.”
Although the gun measures Obama outlined during his remarks in the East Room of the White House are modest, he may have succeeded in what he said he wanted to do in the wake of a mass shooting in Roseburg, Ore., three months ago: politicize the issue of guns so that it becomes a prominent issue ahead of the 2016 election.
In a speech that veered from weepy to outraged and even comic, the president said his decision to exercise his executive authority — a move that has infuriated many Republicans — was an effort to prevent further violence and bring the country together on a divisive issue.
“I’m not on the ballot again; I’m not looking to score some points.” he said, adding later that it was possible to reconcile the Constitution with additional restrictions on firearms. “We understand there are some constraints on our freedom in order to protect innocent people.”
The package includes 10 provisions, White House officials said. One key provision would require more gun sellers — especially those who do business on the Internet and at gun shows — to be licensed and would force them to conduct background checks on potential buyers. Obama would devote $500 million more in federal funding to treating mental illness — a move that could require congressional approval — and require that firearms lost in transit between a manufacturer and a seller be reported to federal authorities.
At the president’s direction, the FBI will begin hiring more than 230 additional examiners and other personnel to help process background checks 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Also, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has established a new center to investigate illegal gun trafficking online and will devote $4 million and additional personnel to enhance the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network.
“The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can’t hold America hostage. We can’t accept this carnage in our communities,” Obama said in a Twitter message Monday evening, referring to the National Rifle Association.
By limiting the scope of the background checks measure — the administration is clarifying what it means to be “engaged in the business” of selling firearms — it may have bolstered the measure’s legal defensibility at the expense of having a far-reaching impact. This does not constitute new regulation, which would be subject to public comment and congressional review, but its application depends entirely on how aggressively federal authorities press the matter.
And though most of the actions the president outlined can take place unilaterally, lawmakers could raise the prospect of blocking the implementation of some of his plans through the funding process.
On Tuesday, Chris Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association, accused Obama of engaging in “political rhetoric instead of offering meaningful solutions” and said the president’s actions would do little to keep Americans safe.
“The American people do not need more emotional, condescending lectures that are completely devoid of facts,” Cox said in a statement. “The men and women of the National Rifle Association take a back seat to no one when it comes to keeping our communities safe. But the fact is that President Obama’s proposals would not have prevented any of the horrific events he mentioned.”
The House speaker, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, released a statement.
“From Day 1,” he said, “the president has never respected the right to safe and legal gun ownership that our nation has valued since its founding. He knows full well that the law already says that people who make their living selling firearms must be licensed, regardless of venue. Still, rather than focus on criminals and terrorists, he goes after the most law-abiding of citizens. His words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty.

Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., was one of a handful of Arizonans and the only lawmaker from the state to attend President Barack Obama's White House speech Tuesday announcing executive actions on gun control. Gallego, a gun owner and former National Rifle Association member, has worked on gun issues since he joined Congress last year. As part of a gun-violence task force at the Capitol, he and several Democratic lawmakers attended a private meeting with Obama on Monday to talk about his planned actions. Gallego said Tuesday that it was difficult at the speech to see so many people on stage and in the audience who have been affected by gun violence. They included former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was wounded in a mass shooting near Tucson in 2011 and has become a gun-control advocate. He noted that Obama shed tears. ""Seeing the president become emotional thinking about all the babies, essentially, that died in (the mass shooting at) Sandy Hook,"" Gallego said, ""it was really moving."" Guns were a flash point in Gallego's 2014 campaign. His Democratic opponent, Mary Rose Wilcox, and her allies criticized him for being soft on the issue. AZCENTRAL Arizona legislation would ignore Obama gun actions But Gallego noted his activism on gun control, including a trip to Washington to lobby lawmakers and votes at the state Legislature. He said he has continued that work as a congressman by co-sponsoring a ban on assault weapons and legislation to encourage gun sellers to voluntarily conduct background checks. ""What I'm doing here today ... (is) an extension,"" he said. One of Gallego's staunchest supporters was Jennifer Longdon, a Phoenix gun-control advocate who was paralyzed in a shooting. She chastised Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., when he voted against expanded background checks in 2013. Longdon, now a Gallego constituent, was on stage for Obama's speech. ""I knew he was always with us,"" she said, noting Gallego pushed her wheelchair on the D.C. lobbying trip. ""This is personal. And again, Ruben is a gun owner. I am a gun owner. The vice president is a gun owner. ... We’re not gun grabbers.""",2016-01-05 17:57:16,"Gallego, ex-NRA member, lauds Obama gun action",,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

He was speaking about steps his administration is taking to reduce gun violence.  President Barack Obama stops to embrace White House guests and victims of gun violence after speaking in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, about steps his administration is taking to reduce gun violence. Also on stage are those whose lives have been impacted by the gun violence.  Survivors of San Bernardino’s recent mass shooting and families hit by the tragedy reacted on Tuesday to President Obama’s call to tighten gun regulations. In a sometimes tearful speech, the president recounted some of the high-profile mass shootings in recent years and talked about what could be done to cut down on such incidents. One of his primary focuses was on requiring background checks on all gun purchases. At least one surviving family attended the White House speech. Karen Fagan, the ex-wife of San Bernardino shooting victim Harry Bowman, was in the room. “It was so amazing,” said Fagen, of Upland. “I don’t think there was a dry eye in the place as he was speaking.” Fagen was accompanied by two daughters she had with Bowman, Fagen’s husband, and Bowman’s mother and sister-in-law. They were among about 200 audience members, including other families affected by gun violence. Fagan said she thinks Obama is doing the right thing, especially with Congress unwilling to take action. “I think that his plans are long overdue and necessary,” she said. Jennifer Thalasinos watched the speech from her Colton home. She lost her husband Nicholas, 52, in the San Bernardino shooting. She didn’t think Obama’s efforts would do much good. “I don’t see how tightening gun control is going to make a difference,” Thalasinos said. “If somebody wants to get a gun they’re going to get a gun.” Thalasinos said she is a gun-rights advocate. The San Bernardino incident didn’t change her stance on the issue. “If anything it’s made it stronger,” she said. She imagines that during the shooting her husband was probably thinking that if someone in the room had had a concealed carry permit, it might have made a difference. “It’s not beyond the realm of possibility that that could have made a difference in the situation,” she said. “There’s always that possibility.” George Velasco, the uncle of San Bernardino shooting victim Yvette Velasco, 27, of Fontana, said Obama was following through on what he had told family members he met with during his Dec. 18 visit to the Inland area. “The president told us there would be something coming in January,” said George Velasco. “I definitely agree with it.” Robel Tekleab, whose brother-in-law Isaac Amanios was killed in the shooting, supported Velasco. Tekleab worked as a field staffer during Obama’s 2012 relection campaign and said Amanios enjoyed engaging him in political discussions, and was a fan of the President. “I thought he felt our pain personally before, but today even moreso,” said Tekleab. “He showed us how he felt and I am glad he is doing everything in his power. What I want to see is I want Congress do everything in its power also.”California has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation, but Tekleab said it didn’t do much good if all a person has to do is cross a state border to avoid a background check. “The federal government should act,” said Tekleab. “The President, he has to take what he can get at the end of the day. But it should not fall just on his shoulders. It should fall on all of America’s representatives — senators and congressmen and congresswomen, and all state officials — to make sure that nothing like this happens to any family.”Not everyone tuned in to the president’s speech. James Godoy, whose wife, Aurora, was killed in the Dec. 2 shooting, hadn’t heard about Obama’s plan to expand background checks for gun purchases. Godoy, of San Jacinto, said he supports efforts to keep assault weapons out of the hands of criminals. But, he doubts whether new rules would do much to reduce gun violence. “It wouldn’t affect people getting guns illegally,” Godoy said. “Someone could go get a gun right away and shoot up wherever, regardless of the laws.” Staff writers David Danelski, Jeff Horseman, Jennifer Iyer, Tom Sheridan, Craig Shultz and Stephen Wall contributed to this report.

59,http://www.inquisitr.com/2684222/the-mystery-of-the-18-minutes-post-shooting-where-were-the-san-bernardino-shooters/,"The FBI is searching for answers after the San Bernardino shooters left the scene of the massacre that occurred on December 2. Where was Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik in the short 18 minutes after the shooting occurred? The San Bernardino massacre was one of the most terrible terrorist attacks since the attack on September 11. A total of 14 people were killed, and 22 injured. Most people who were involved were county employees attending a holiday party. According to the Guardian, David Bowdich, FBI assistant director, mentioned the following at a news conference. ""We have accounted for three hours and 42 minutes of time,"" he said. ""We are missing 18 minutes of time."" Bowdich preceded to express the importance as to why the FBI feels it is necessary to know where Farook and Malik went post-shooting. ""Why is that important? We want to know if they stopped at any residences, businesses or locations that we don't already know about, or if they contacted anyone,"" Bowdich said. ""As we've said before, there will be no stone left unturned. This is not an average investigation."" A few hours after the attack, both Farook and Malik were killed during a police shootout. Enrique Marquez, who was Farook's friend and neighbor, assisted in the purchase of two guns that were used during the attack and shortly after the massacre, he entered into a mental health facility. He will be arraigned today on charges of supplying the weapons that were used by Farook and Malik. Law Enforcement are still seeking answers as to what motivated Farook and Malik. From 12:59 p.m. to 1:17 p.m., the whereabouts of Farook and Malik were unknown. Farook and Malik traveled from Redlands to San Bernardino, allegedly stopping at different places on the way. Bowdich asked the public for a favor.""If the public has any media, witnessed any sightings, we want to have the information.""It is unknown, but unlikely, if the San Bernardino attack was foreign-directed, although it is believed to be an inspired terrorist attack. Farook was born and raised in the United States, whereas Malik was born in Pakistan, but is considered a legal U.S. resident. A few years before the attack in San Bernardino, Farook and Malik traveled to Saudia Arabia. They committed to jihadism and martyrdom based on private messages to each other and stocked large amounts of bomb-making equipment, weapons, and ammunition in their home. James B. Comey expressed that Farook and Malik are ""homegrown violent extremists."" However, no connection was made between the attackers and foreign terrorist groups. So, where did Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik go during those 18 minutes just after the attack? The FBI says that Farook and Malik could have stopped at a business, a home, or even a storage shed. Investigators have interviewed over 500 people trying to located Farook's and Malik's whereabouts. However, the FBI admits that they do not know where they were during those 18 minutes. Here is a look at the timeline provided by ABC News.Prior to the attack in San Bernardino In 2005, Syed Farook met his new next door neighbor, Enrique Marquez. Farook introduced Marquez to Islamic religion and Marquez eventually converted in 2007. Shortly thereafter, Farook introduced him to radical Islamic ideology. Farook and Marquez started planning out terrorist attacks in Southern California, although they never went through with their plans. Marquez frequently bought guns and other weapons for Farook, and took trips to gun ranges to train for their terrorist attacks. According to Marquez, in 2013, Farook and Marquez stopped planning attacks, as their contact started to decline. Farook married Tashifeen Malik in November, 2014, which was considered as a fraudulent marriage due to the fact that Malik and Farook were extended family members. Just one month prior to the San Bernardino attack, Marquez wrote a Facebook post, ""I lead multiple lives and I'm wondering when it's all going to collapse on M[e]."" The Day of The Attack -- December 2 Marquez, who was working at Walmart the time, clocked in at 7 a.m. At about 8:45 a.m., Malik was online searching for ISIS materials. At approximately 8:48, Farook entered the Inland Regional Center, where he was to attend a work conference. Farook set a bag down on a table at 9:05 a.m., which was later identified as an IED. Farook left the Inland Regional Center at 10:37 in a rented black SUV and returned at approximately 10:58 a.m. with ""at least one individual"" dressed in black tactical gear, later identified to by Malik. Shooting began and numerous people inside and outside of the Inland Regional Center were shot by Farook and Malik. At 11:14, Malik's Facebook page announced her allegiance to the leader of ISIS. This was the last known action taken by Farook and Malik before they were gunned down by the police several hours later sometime between 3 and 4 p.m.Marquez, still at work, left for lunch at 11:56 a.m., returning about an hour later. He clocked out of work at 4 p.m. and the next day, he called 911 to admit that his neighbor did the San Bernardino shooting. He identified Syed Farook and allegedly admitted that Farook used one of his guns. Marquez went to the emergency room thereafter and was admitted to the psychiatric ward until he is arraigned on Wednesday.

60,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/06/the-right-to-bear-arms-obama-gun-control-background-checks,"Yes, the constitution protects the right to bear arms. It also protects the right of free speech, free assembly and of religion. Where are the lobbyists for that? Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.18 BST President Barack Obama cried during his announcement of new executive actions designed to curb gun violence in the United States, by restricting the access to firearms of those who present a clear danger to themselves or others and improving access to mental health services for those in need. Recounting the children shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary school, he brushed at the tears rolling down his cheeks, and said, “First graders. Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad. And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.” While the president’s tears are not surprising, given his grief and frustration over gun violence in America, he moved to dry them quickly. There is no time for tears – not in America, where gun violence is rampant, mass shootings occur with regularity and those opposing him are gearing up for a fight.  Since taking office, the president has given 13 speeches on gun violence after mass shooting incidents over the course of his two terms. And yet, almost before the president had finished speaking this time, House speaker Paul Ryan issued a statement which read, “No matter what President Obama says, his word does not trump the second amendment”. Speaker Ryan, the National Rifle Association and other politicians and gun-rights advocates continue to promote the falsehood that Americans’ second amendment rights – “the right of the people to keep and bear arms” – is being taken away. Meanwhile, as the president astutely noted in his speech, the political worship of gun ownership has eroded the first amendment rights – the freedom of (and from) religion, the right to peaceful assembly and the right to free speech – of all citizens. The President juxtaposed the acknowledged, constitutional right to bear arms with rights of freedom of speech, assembly and worship by invoking the Christians shot in Charleston in 2015, the Sikhs killed in Oak Creek in 2012, the Jews killed in Kansas City in 2014 and the Muslims killed in Chapel Hill in 2015. They, too, had constitutional rights, he said – as well at the rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”. Our founding documents didn’t just protect the right to bear arms: they were designed to protect all the principles upon which America was founded – and the first among those were freedom of worship, peaceful assembly and the right to free speech. The president’s comments reflect one of the fundamental theses of Firmin DeBrabander recent book Do Guns Make Us Free?: Democracy and the Armed Society. DeBrabander went further than the president, though, stating “the armed society to which the gun rights movement hastens us – a society where gun-free zones are increasingly rare, and civility is enforced by the gun – is no longer recognizably free.” Gun rights advocates – many whom also believe that the US constitution is divinely inspired and that the rights it enumerates are God-given – face a conundrum. Their very insistence that the government not restrict guns in public spaces or limit their sales in any way also obviously inhibit other Americans’ rights as covered by the US constitution. People in the state of Texas are now grappling with this very issue. As of 1 January 2016, concealed gun license owners in the state of Texas can now carry their guns openly in public places. The new law presents an issue for business owners, who now have to mount prominent signs if they wish to restrict open and concealed carry weapons in their businesses, and who stand to lose customers whether they allow or prohibit open carry. Students on the campus of University of Texas will have to deal with this as well come August 2016, when those with concealed carry permits will be able to bring their guns on campus. The public presence of loaded weapons in Ferguson, Missouri – carried by Oath Keepers with unknown motives after a state of emergency was declared – did not feel safe to people exercising their right to peaceful assembly. Muslims who feel intimidated in the practice of their faith by the presence of angry, armed protestors outside of their mosques have little recourse to the infringement on their freedom to worship in peace. People stay quiet because someone packing heat may take exception to their rights to freedom of speech tacitly accept the loss of freedom in order to dodge potential bullets.

Media professor James Tracy's last day at the university in Boca Raton will be Friday, the school said in a statement after alerting him of the decision in a letter on Tuesday. Tracy, 50, has worked at the university since 2002. He could not be reached on Wednesday and his attorney, Thomas Johnson, declined to comment. Tracy's website, MemoryHoleBlog.com, gained notice in 2013 after he claimed the December 2012 massacre by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, was staged by “crisis actors” hired by the Obama administration. The attack killed 26 people, including 20 children. Last month, the university said it would seek to fire Tracy after he sent a letter to the parents of 6-year-old Sandy Hook victim Noah Pozner demanding proof they were his parents. On his blog, Tracy called them ""alleged parents"" and accused Lenny and Veronique Pozner of fabricating their son’s death certificate to cash in on the tragedy. The Pozners accused Tracy of harassment. “He has shown no remorse and continues to conceive conspiracy theories out of each new mass shooting,” they wrote in a Dec. 10 letter in the Sun-Sentinel newspaper. Tracy also said the San Bernardino incident, in which a militant Muslim couple killed 14 people last month, was a hoax. The official reason for Tracy's termination was that he twice failed to submit forms explaining outside activities in order for university administrators to address potential conflicts of interest. ""By simply submitting the completed activity form, you would have been compliant with no further discipline,"" university Vice Provost Diane Alperin wrote in a letter on Tuesday.

Republican nomination contender Sen. Ted Cruz was among the harshest critics, posting a picture of Obama in a crown with the heading ""Stop Obama's Unconstitutional Executive Action!""
Advertisement ""Gun control is government control,"" Cruz, of Texas, said on Twitter. The tweet linked to a campaign website showing Obama dressed in military garb with the headline ""Obama wants your guns. Support the protection of your Second Amendment rights!"" Obama announced measures, some of which require congressional approval, that aim at making it harder for criminals and the mentally ill to obtain guns. That includes provisions that narrow the so-called ""gun show loophole"" and legislation that will increase access to mental health services. Republican front-runner Donald Trump accused Obama of ""making an end-run around the Constitution, trying to go directly to executive order and restrict one of the basic, fundamental principles of our country."" He later added, ""Look at Paris. If you had people in that room that had a revolver strapped to their belt, they had a gun strapped to someplace and ... the good guys could do a little shooting back, it wouldn't have been 130 people killed -- that I can tell you.""
Advertisement Other Republican presidential hopefuls took to Twitter and appeared on television to denounce the president's actions. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said the actions will ""nothing to prevent violence or crimes"" and condemned them as a punishment for law-abiding people who want to purchase weapons. He accused Obama of being ""obsessed"" with undermining the Second Amendment. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson echoed the sentiments. Carson said the president's actions ""have everything to do with advancing his political agenda & little to do with actually protecting American citizens."" Any executive order President Obama signs that regulates firearms transactions will merely regulate the freedom of law abiding citizens.— Dr. Ben Carson (@RealBenCarson) January 5, 2016 Any executive order President Obama signs that regulates firearms transactions will merely regulate the freedom of law abiding citizens. At the same time, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton vowed to ""take on that fight"" and continue the push for gun control if elected. ""Thank you, @POTUS, for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next president has to build on that progress—not rip it away,"" she said on Twitter.

65,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/06/the-right-is-failing-in-the-emotional-war-over-guns/,"The Right isn’t doing its job when it comes to convincing people guns are okay. Yes, open carry is legal in 46 states and groups like Institute for Justice have won important court battles over Chicago and Washington D.C.’s draconian gun laws. The problem is these wins are really only temporary because the U.S. Supreme Court can change its mind, and laws can be changed. The Right has got to get better at messaging on why it’s okay for people to own guns or the Left will keep winning the emotional battle year after year and tragedy after tragedy. What’s the narrative from yesterday’s speech on gun executive action? It isn’t just President Barack Obama’s announcement (which AP already explained won’t do anything and Ed analyzed), but the fact he cried while talking about children dying in a mass shooting. It doesn’t matter whether the tears were real or not (as some on the Right are stupidly focusing on), but that he choked up while mentioning dead children. That’s what going to be remembered from all of this. It’s why pictures of families crying at funerals or outside the scene of a mass shooting are so effective in the Left’s strategy on guns. They pull at the heart strings and cause people to react in ways which make it harder for logic to reign supreme. It’s something right out of Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals. He suggested, “the threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.” This means the threat of a child getting killed in a school or someone being shot in a movie theater becomes something people start fearing and wanting protection from. Even my mom told me to “be careful” when I went to see Star Wars last month because she was worried about Aurora happening all over again. It’s why Obama brought up what happened at Sandy Hook, Aurora, and Columbine during yesterday’s speech. The threat is, “it can happen to you, your kids, or your friends and we’ve got to do something NOW!” It’s effective whether we like it or not. The Right’s reaction to gun violence or new laws is just predictable and tiresome. Some start screaming words like “unconstitutional” or “Bill of Rights” when talking about gun laws, while others use cold, hard logic when explaining why Obama’s “executive action” is meaningless and ridiculous. It’s an easy trap to fall into because that strategy has pretty much been engrained into our thoughts and action. If something is unconstitutional, we’ll say so or just outright mock of the “facts” the Left spews out when trying to work the court of public opinion on guns (or any other hot button issue). Facts are important, but the Right is doing things backwards when it comes to explaining WHY guns are okay and how they actually can protect us from criminals. Even the NRA’s “a good guy with a gun” message falls flat because, with respect to Wayne LaPierre, he isn’t best messenger and the narrative isn’t that exciting. LaPierre is telling the truth, but the message isn’t working. What the Right should do is point out stories where the “good guy with a gun” actually stopped a bad guy with a gun. It’s why Kristina Ribali’s Hot Air piece on how a gun saved her from a neighborhood stalker is so awesome because it personalizes the situation. A mom defending herself and two kids from a bad guy. That’s something which can resonate with more than just the fire-breathing conservatives and libertarians. The same goes for the Chicago grandfather who was arrested in 2012 for owning an unlicensed gun after shooting a burglar. The Chicago Tribune helped set the narrative right after the arrest (emphasis mine). An 80-year-old tavern owner in Englewood believes it’s “unjust” that he is facing charges after shooting a burglar, but believes he will prevail in court. “It’s wrong,” Homer “Tank” Wright said as he walked into his bar after being released from jail this afternoon. “Unjust that I can’t protect me.” Wright eventually had the charges dropped because the court of public opinion was against police and prosecutors. Look at the young Kentucky woman who took the gun away from a robber and shot him or the ten-year-old New York boy who scared off two intruders by firing a shot at them. These situations may be rare, but so are mass shootings (even if the Left wants to pretend they happen every day). The Right needs to point out more stories like this because it personalizes the issue. The “this could happen to you” narrative is turned upside down because it shows the benefit of what owning a guns can do and how they can be used for personal protection. There are plenty of times guns in the hands of civilians have actually saved lives, but for whatever reason those stories don’t get publicized. It’s probably because they’re not “sexy news” but that’s why the Right has to find them and be willing to use them! This doesn’t mean the Right needs to completely forget the Constitution or cold, hard logic when it comes to discussing issues. It just means they need to be shrewd in deciding when the right time is to start using them. Tank Wright’s story can then lead into a discussion on why restrictive gun laws force grandfathers to become criminals in the search for protection. Kristina Ribali’s story can lead to a talk on why the Founding Fathers made sure the Second Amendment was in the Bill of Rights. A talk about a college student using an AR-15 to scare off intruders can lead to a conversation about how Internet gun purchases still require a background check because they have to be shipped to an FFL dealer. The Right has to start learning how to message better because Congress won’t be in the hands of Republicans forever and it’s always possible for state governments to switch from one party to the other. We have to adapt our strategy or the Left will keep exploiting tragedy to push their agenda. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

No further controls on these tools will have the slightest effect on gun-related atrocities. The real reason for the push to control lies elsewhere, with political motivation at its core, driven by a strong irrational appeal to raw emotions. The promise believed as gospel by control advocates is that something will somehow be made more safe, if only another toothless law is passed. This is not unique innovative thinking, reason be damned. It is currently being proven daily that with any increase in citizen possession of firearms, the results are a further drop in violent and deadly gun crime. Statistics supporting this are conveniently ignored by most press sources. The burden of proof, having been vindicated, is constantly suppressed by irrational fear generated by the same news sources. Most of these sources fall under the influence and support for further controls. Politics rules. Truth lies elsewhere. One party owns the control argument. Its appeal is emotional. If ever there was a call for “out-of-the-box” thinking, this is it. Scott Roberts Laguna Beach • • • After all the discussion about the gun show loophole, following the latest mass shooting, the Register owes it to its readers to accurately describe what the loophole actually is, clear of the political and ideological agenda of those who cite it. Here is what I have found regarding the loophole. The gun show loophole only applies to “Antique firearms,” as defined in section 921(a)(16) of Title 18 of the United States Code, and curio or relic rifles/shotguns, defined in section 478.11 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations, that are over 50 years old, are exempt from this requirement. Except for this provision, any private party transfer (non-licensed gun dealer) must be conducted through a fully licensed firearms dealer where background checks are required. This statute applies to sales between private parties regardless of where they occur and not just at gun shows. Jim Whistler Corona Del Mar • • • Re: “Safety in more guns?” [Letters, Dec. 26]: Mr. Lockhart, a sincere thank you for your military service. While your points about professional vs. civilian firearm expertise may be well taken, they are all beside the point. Studies (interviews with convicted felons in state prisons) have shown that they, the “bad guys,” don’t fear cops, they fear exactly who you mentioned, a potential victim who is armed, and, for the same reasons you suggested: they might get shot by a frightened civilian. FBI crime statistics reflect the lower crime rates in parts of our country where concealed carry permit holders have increased, and where household gun ownership is “common.” While your letter expresses the fears of some well-meaning citizens, the point of guns in the house is to make the criminals afraid. Statistics and “studies” show that civilian gun ownership does just that, in most cases without a shot ever being fired. Bill Badenoch Huntington Beach • • • James Lockhart is certainly credentialed for the military, understands his subordinates and provides a well-written case questioning “safety in more guns.” But to compare 18-21-year-olds in a war setting, who must carry military weapons 24/7 for offensive purposes, to the general populace, which would include 65-year-old grandmothers living alone and millions of other Joe Citizens who may have a firearm strictly for rare defensive purposes, is a stretch of logic that I absolutely reject.

71,http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/HINE8YpZtBk/,"The British House of Commons will hold a debate on Monday, January 18, 2016, on whether or not Donald Trump should be banned from the United Kingdom later this month, based on his call for Muslims to be shut out of the United States temporarily. The United Kingdom lawmakers have noted that Trump's proposal was in response to the mass shooting that killed 14 people and injured 21 others in San Bernardino, California. The attack was carried out by a Muslim couple who supported the Islamic State. It is also common knowledge in the United Kingdom that the U.S. Republican presidential aspirant enjoys the backing of a majority of Americans on his proposed ban. Gateway Pundit scores a 55 percent majority of Americans who support Trump's Muslim ban, along with 72 percent of Republicans and 45 percent of Democrats. The British debate would be a result of two petitions on the government website. One petition calling for U.S. Republican presidential aspirant Donald Trump to be banned from the United Kingdom has so far attracted 568,609 signatures. A counter petition against the proposed ban on Trump has been signed by 39,417 people. David Cameron mindful of Muslim constituents [Photo by Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images] Trump has called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" after deadly terror attacks involving Islamic extremists in California and France. British Prime Minister David Cameron has characterized Trump's comment as ""divisive, unhelpful and quite simply wrong"". While building a Muslim constituency, Cameron has made it a point to declare Islamic terrorists not representative of Islam. Meanwhile, Muslim voters have come of age as an important consideration in British parliamentary elections. According to the Henry Jackson Society, the number of Muslims is now greater than the margin of victory in 2010 for 159 of the 632 seats in parliament. The Guardian states that the Muslim population of England and Wales is growing faster than the overall population, with a higher proportion of children and a lower ratio of elderly people. The vast majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom live in England: 2,660,116 (one in 20 of the overall U.K. population). The Muslim Council of Britain notes that Muslims make up 20 percent or more of the electorate in 26 constituencies and live in all local authority areas in England and Wales. Sociologist Sundas Ali of Oxford University had this to say about Muslims in the United Kingdom. ""There has been a spreading-out effect and this has accelerated in the past 10 years."" While participation in secular non-sharia politics is considered kufar, or not of Allah, efforts have been made by Muslim leaders to get their people engaged in a collective activity where their community is impacted. The million man march of black Muslim Americans is a case in point, or the drive to get half a million signatures on a petition banning Trump from the United Kingdom. Dr. Haitham al-Haddad, who serves as a judge for the Islamic Sharia Council of the United Kingdom and Eire, encourages such activity based upon ""strategic decision making"" among British Muslims. According to Islam 21c.com, he quotes two Qur'anic commands that make united action among Muslims obligatory for their own good. First is what Allāh says in the Qur'ān. ""And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allāh (i.e. this Qur'ān or the guidance of Allāh), and be not divided among yourselves."" Second is the statement of the Prophet Mohammed. ""Adhere to the jamāʿah (community), and avoid division, for the Satan is closer to the lone individual and is far from a group. Whoever seeks the expanse of Paradise should stick to the jamāʿah."" The British reality of shariah [Photo by Getty Images] Parliamentary member Helen Jones of the Labour Party, traditionally reliant on Muslim votes, chairs the committee deciding which petitions warrant a debate for the United Kingdom. Putting on a mantle of impartiality, she issued the following statement. ""By scheduling a debate on these petitions, the committee is not expressing a view on whether or not the government should exclude Donald Trump from the U.K. As with any decision to schedule a petition for debate, it simply means that the committee has decided that the subject should be debated. A debate will allow a range of views to be expressed."" Chancellor George Osborne told the House of Commons he does not think Trump should be banned from the United Kingdom. Osborne preferred to ""engage in a robust democratic argument"" with Trump rather than ban him. And, as the Trump Organization warned, ""alienate the many millions of United States citizens who wholeheartedly support Mr. Trump and have made him the forerunner by far in the 2016 presidential election.""

Sitting down with Anderson Cooper for the live event, the President got personal on one of the lingering issues he’s had yet to get a substantial grasp on while occupying the Oval Office. The White House said Wednesday the President was looking forward to using the event as an opportunity to engage with Americans on both sides of the gun debate. “The President has often said that we can disagree without being disagreeable,” said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. Read more: Read Barack Obama’s Speech on New Gun Control Measures And on Thursday, Obama did just that — on more than one occasion he was grilled on whether or not the executive actions he has proposed would infringe on the rights of law-abiding gun owners. “There really is nothing that we’re proposing that makes it harder for you to purchase a firearm if you need one,” Obama told a rape survivor who asked why the administration was attempting to make her and her kids feel less safe. Obama also defended his stance on the Second Amendment, which has been repeatedly called into question by those on the right and those within the pro-gun community. “I respect the Second Amendment,” Obama said. “I respect people who want a gun for self protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship, but all of us can agree it makes sense to keep guns out of the hands of people who want to do others harm or do themselves harm.” The town hall drew criticism from the gun lobby earlier on Thursday. The National Rifle Association, which was invited to the town hall, issued a statement to CNN saying the organization “sees no reason to participate in a public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House.” Both the White House and CNN have said the network, not the Obama administration, organized the event. Read more: Why President Obama Cries Over Gun Control Despite the NRA’s apparent absence, Obama addressed the organization early in the discussion with Cooper saying he’d be “happy” to talk to the group about gun control at the White House. “But the conversation has to be based on facts and truth and what we’re actually proposing,” Obama said. “Not some imaginary fiction in which Obama is trying to take away your guns.” Obama suggested that the NRA benefitted from convincing its members that the government is after their firearms, saying, “every time there is a mass shooting gun sales spike.” The President spoke Thursday after spending the entire week engaging on the topic of guns. On Friday, he’ll convene on the topic in a conference call with grassroots organizers. The President’s recent gun control push comes after years of failed efforts to pass legislation on the issue. Following the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, which left 20 children and 6 adults dead, Obama vowed to do whatever it would take to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and prevent future mass shootings. But the gun reforms he championed were rejected by Congress. That legislative failure eventually prompted Obama this week to bypass lawmakers and create some reforms using executive orders. Flanked by family members of victims of mass shootings, gun violence, and suicides, Obama Tuesday announced a series of executive actions including expanding background checks, adding law enforcement jobs, and increasing funding to address mental health issues. The President acknowledged that his actions will not end mass shootings, but said they were a step toward reducing gun violence. “We know we can’t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world,” Obama said. “But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence.”  Contact us at letters@time.com.",2016-01-07 17:30:15,President Obama Will Continue Gun Control Push at CNN Town Hall,,4419,http://time.com

        Sapna Maheshwari Posted on January 5, 2016, at 6:43 p.m. ET Shares of gun manufacturers soared today as President Obama outlined a series of executive actions meant to expand background checks for firearm sales. Smith & Wesson rose 11% to close at $25.86, its highest closing price since it began trading more than a decade ago, while Sturm Ruger jumped 7% to $65.54. The broader S&P 500 rose just 0.2% for the day. Gun stocks tend to rally at any talk of gun control, which often serves as a catalyst for sales. Demand for firearms hit an all-time high in 2013 after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut — gun buyers became so convinced that a crackdown was approaching that the industry was hit by ""panic buying,"" as Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack put it on a conference call in 2014. ""Contrary to what common sense would seem to dictate, the data would suggest that a Democrat in the White House, and more specifically a Democrat campaigning to be in the White House, is very good for the gun industry, at least in the short run,"" analysts at Wedbush Securities wrote in an October note. ""Although Barack Obama has done nothing (at least so far) to advance the cause of gun control, he has been labeled the 'gun salesman of the decade,"" the analysts wrote at the time. Smith & Wesson raised its earnings forecast for the year ending April 30 on Monday night, citing higher than expected sales at its distributors and ""strong growth"" in background checks for December. Obama said on Friday that he was looking at measures to fight the nation's ""epidemic of gun violence"" in his last year in office. ""I believe in the Second Amendment.

	Ted Johnson Senior Editor President Obama continued his push for gun reform at a CNN town hall on Thursday, spending a great deal of time defending his measures as “common sense” measures and not a “conspiracy” that “we are creating a plot to take everybody’s guns.” The event at George Mason University was organized by CNN and moderated by Anderson Cooper. The National Rifle Assn., which has been particularly critical of Obama’s plans to take a series of executive actions on background checks and other measures, declined an invitation to attend, although there were gun rights advocates present. Obama said that the NRA had also been invited to the White House on certain occasions, but they declined. He said that his position had been “consistently mischaracterized” by the gun lobby and others.  “I’m happy to talk with them…but the conversation has to be based in facts and truth,” he said. In a New York Times op ed that was posted on Thursday evening, Obama wrote that he would only campaign for candidates who support “common sense” gun reform.  He belittled claims that he was out to take away people’s guns, noting that he was in the final year of his term. “When will I have started on this enterprise” to confiscate guns? he said. He called it an “imaginary fiction.” Instead, he noted how he respected the Second Amendment and the traditions of gun ownership, particularly in rural areas where firearms are vital for protection. Still, questions were raised on the effectiveness of his proposals, which include an executive order clarifying the definition of who is in the business of selling guns and therefore subject to licensing and to performing background checks on gun buyers. “I think it is important not to suggest that if we can’t solve every crime, we can’t solve any crime,” he said. Among those asking questions was Taya Kyle, widow of Chris Kyle, whose story was depicted in last year’s “American Sniper.” She expressed skepticism of Obama’s gun measures, and noted that the focus on firearm violence was coming as many parts of the country were experiencing all-time low murder rates. Obama acknowledged the decline in violent crime, but he challenged the notion that it was because of higher gun ownership. Another woman, a rape victim, shared concerns that stricter gun measures would make it more difficult for her to defend herself. “There’s nothing that we’ve proposed that would make it harder for you to purchase a firearm,” Obama said. The forum was largely free of heated rhetoric, which was one of the intents in bringing multiple points of view together in the same room. Others came to Obama’s defense, including Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Arizona), who was shot in the head during a mass shooting in Tucson five years ago. She stood by him as he noted the futility of the task of even trying to confiscate the 350 million guns believed to be in circulation in the country. Another speaker in the audience was Father Michael Pfleger, a priest in inner-city Chicago, who said that “it is easier to get a gun in my neighborhood than it is to get a computer.”  “I don’t understand why we can’t [get a title] for guns just like cars,” he said. As the president watched, CNN also replayed an excerpt of Obama’s speech at the White House on Tuesday, when he cried as he recalled visiting the families of the victims of the 2012 Newtown, Conn. massacre. At the town hall, Obama said that his Newtown trip “was the only time I have seen the Secret Service cry.” The visit, he said, “continues to haunt me.” The Business of Entertainment",2016-01-07 22:59:18,"Obama Says Gun Control ‘Common Sense,’ Blasts ‘Conspiracy’ at CNN Town Hall",,19076,http://www.variety.com

Bernie Sanders becomes the Democratic nominee in 2016, he might have trouble winning support from President Barack Obama. Based on the terms the president laid out in a op-ed on gun control published Thursday night, Sanders’ record on gun control could land him in the category of people for whom Obama would not campaign. “I will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support commonsense gun reform,” Obama wrote in the op-ed, which was published in  the New York Times. The president outlined some specific areas he sees as in need of such gun reform. He argued, as he did during a town hall on guns Thursday night, that the gun lobby has controlled Congress and led lawmakers to leave the gun industry “almost entirely unaccountable.” Obama said this accountability stems from actions such as Congress blocking requirements that firearms have safety features, making it difficult to conduct research on gun violence research and protecting gun manufacturers from liability for gun injuries. On this last point, the president used particularly strong language, saying that Congress has “guaranteed that manufacturers enjoy virtual immunity from lawsuits, which means that they can sell lethal products and rarely face consequences.” Sanders voted for that piece of legislation when he was in the House of Representatives in 2005,  Politico reported. While Sanders has spoken out on the campaign trail about the need for gun reform, he has stood by this position and other previous gun votes while running for president. “The issues that you're talking about is, if somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer, and that murderer kills somebody with the gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible?” Sanders said on CNN in July. “Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beat somebody over the head with a hammer.”  The issue of Sanders’ gun record has come up throughout the campaign — perhaps most notably during the first Democratic primary debate in October when his opponents and CNN moderator Anderson Cooper  pressed him on the issue. Cooper reminded the audience of Sanders’ positions on gun control, explaining that Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks and a waiting period before buying a firearm, he supported allowing passengers to bring guns in their bags on Amtrak trains, and he voted to give gun manufacturers immunity in state and federal courts. Sanders attributed his record to serving office in the rural state of Vermont, where people like guns, and said he voted for the 2005 gun manufacturer bill because there were other parts of the legislation he liked. But some deemed his answer weak, and when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked if she thought Sanders was tough enough on guns, she responded: “No, not at all.” Clinton and the other Democratic presidential candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, have typically spoken in stronger terms about gun control throughout the campaign. O’Malley in particular has  lashed out at the other two Democrats in an attempt to showcase his particularly strong support for gun control. Obama announced a series of  executive actions on gun control this week and has been focused on getting out his message around those measures. He has not clarified which lawmakers his op-ed might apply to in terms of support. Sanders said he supported the president’s executive actions and would keep them if he were elected in 2016. “It's become clear that no mass shooting, no matter how big or bloody, will inspire Republicans to put children and innocent Americans over the interests of the NRA. They are simply more loyal to gun lobbyists than our children,” Sanders said in a statement. “A vast majority of the American people, including responsible gun owners who are sickened by the deaths of so many innocent people, agree with the commonsense reforms announced today.”",2016-01-08 10:15:00,Did Obama Diss Bernie Sanders?

78,http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/jtiN4Dap59I/,"On Thursday night, American Sniper widow Taya Kyle confronted Barack Obama in person during a live CNN broadcast, challenging the president on his recent gun control executive order. Chris Kyle's wife claimed that the gun control laws are ineffective because none of the murderers would have been stopped by background checks. She also noted that the U.S. murder rate has lowered even as U.S. gun ownership has increased dramatically. In a related report by the Inquisitr, when Obama made his gun control speech, he began tearing up. Some critics called Obama's tears fake, while others said he was crying just like Adolf Hitler, who wept before implementing the Nazis' gun control laws. George Zimmerman, shooter of Trayvon Martin, even went to so far as to call Obama a ""piece of garbage"" for his ""crocodile tears."" Obama's executive order enacted several new pieces of gun control enforcement, with changes to background checks being one of the largest factors. According to Taya Kyle, gun control laws such as this are not effective, nor would they have stopped mass shooting such as the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre. ""I don't know that any of them would have been stopped by a background check,"" Kyle told Obama in front of the live CNN audience. ""So I think part it we have to recognize is we cannot outlaw murder. Because the people who are murdering are breaking the law. They don't have the moral code that we have. So they can do the same amount of damage with a pipe bomb. The problem is that they want to murder."" [Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images] Kyle told Obama that ""background checks aren't going to stop me from getting a gun."" Legally, she wants gun rights to be upheld so she can ""have the freedom to carry whatever weapon I feel I need."" She says the gun control laws gives Americans a ""false hope"" that will not protect them. The American Sniper widow later noted that ""we are at the lowest murder rate in our country. All time of low of murders. All time high for gun ownership. Why not celebrate where we are?"" In response, Obama first thanked American sniper Chris Kyle for his service as a U.S. Navy SEAL. He also agreed with Taya that the reduction of ""murder rates and violent crime generally is something we don't celebrate enough."" But the president disagreed that this success was due to gun rights, claiming that there was not a ""one-to-one correlation there."" ""I challenge the notion that the reason for that is that there is more gun ownership. Because if you look at the where the areas are with the highest gun ownership, those are the places that the crime hasn't dropped down that much,"" Obama said. Still, Obama admitted that ""criminals will get their hands on firearms even if there is a background check."" He insisted that further gun control laws were necessary by making a comparison to traffic laws. ""In the same way, we don't eliminate all traffic accidents, but over the course of 20 years traffic accidents get lower,"" he explained. Chris and Taya Kyle [Image via Facebook] During a commercial break for the town hall meeting, Obama shook hands with Kyle, but he also criticized the NRA for not showing up. ""They're just down the street,"" he said, according to the New York Post. ""Since this is a main reason they exist, you'd think that they'd be prepared to have a debate with the president."" Others in the crowd also criticized Obama for his gun control laws. At one point, Obama admitted to never owning a gun, and he was challenged by a rape survivor and a mother. But the president did have support from other members of the crowd, including Gabby Giffords, who has been pushing for gun control ever since she was injured severely during an assassination attempt.  Taya Kyle's gun control critique did not end there. Writing an op-ed for CNN, she provided a lengthier explanation for why she believes Obama's gun control efforts are fatally flawed. She believes the focus for preventing mass shootings should not be on the weapons, but instead on the killers and the flawed health care system that does not prevent them from taking action. She used Eddie Ray Routh, the killer of her husband Chris Kyle, as an example of someone who had access to guns for years while working in an armory. ""Routh] worked in an armory with daily access to every caliber of high powered weapon for years,"" she explained. ""He chose to kill when he got out of an environment of accountability and drug testing. Simply having a weapon did not make him a murderer."" Routh had claimed to be experiencing PTSD during his trial, but Taya says he was a ""known drug user"" who ""repeatedly got out of trouble by claiming PTSD."" ""The officers would take him at his word, deliver him to a mental health facility where the facility would write a diagnosis which is known in that community as a label for likely drug use, and they would release him. Because of the HIPAA law and our desire to protect everyone's privacy, we allow bad behavior to slip through the cracks."" Kyle believes police should be able to intervene before the mass shootings ever occur based upon the warning signs provided by mental health professionals. She points out that there are plenty of existing gun control laws that are not being enforced. ""We have plenty of laws on the books that we cannot or do not enforce. Let's start enforcing what we have before creating new laws,"" she wrote. As an example, she also noted how the hysteria over so-called ""assault rifle"" guns is overblown by some in the media since the existing gun control laws already cover those areas. ""In actuality, fully automatic weapons are already highly restricted and require an additional license most gun owners will never have,"" she said. ""The lack of understanding makes it easy to develop rhetoric and legislation that will calm the fears of people who don't understand a given subject, but that doesn't really change any end result because we cannot legislate the evil side of humanity.""

79,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/132065493/0/phoenix/local~Tucson-survivors-mark-years-since-shooting/,"Though the gathering Friday was to remember the victims of a shooting outside Tucson five years ago, among the survivors exchanging hugs, tears and smiles was a woman who lost her son in another mass shooting. Caren Teves, whose son was among 12 killed at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., has been welcomed into the fraternity of survivors of the 2011 shooting at a Safeway grocery store outside Tucson that killed six and wounded 13, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. “They reached out to me,” said Teves, who lives in Phoenix, but drove down for the morning ceremony. “It’s a very difficult thing to grasp unless you’re there.” As the ceremony ended, she stood in the hospital lobby near Patricia Maisch,  the woman who wrestled a magazine of bullets away from the gunman who shot Giffords and fired into the crowd waiting to see her. Maisch's actions prevented the gunman from reloading, “We’re a comfort to each other,” Maisich said. “We’ve taken her into our group. We’ve made her a double survivor.” The ceremony, which has become an annual event in the five years since the shooting, was planned for the grounds outside the Banner University Medical Center, on the expansive lawn where an impromptu memorial of flowers and other items grew in the days following the Jan. 8, 2011, shooting. But the threat of inclement weather moved it inside a hospital auditorium. Patrick Fitzgerald, a hospital chaplain, led the prayers. “We pray for anyone who was wounded emotionally or psychologically,” he said from the stage. “We pray for everyone who bears scars from the day, that they continue to be healed.” He also made an oblique reference to Jared Loughner, the gunman who was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in federal prison for the shooting. “We pray for those suffering any form of mental illness,” he said. “We pray that resources may be provided to give them any treatment they need.” The names of the six dead were read, followed by the 13 who were injured. A bell rang after each name. Across the city, others rang bells at the same time. AZCENTRAL Tucson shooting still seems unreal for parents of Christina-Taylor Green, who never got to grow up This was the first year that Giffords was not in Tucson for the anniversary of the shooting. She and her husband, the retired astronaut Mark Kelly, were in Washington, D.C., and had planned to meet with staff members of their group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, many of whom worked for Giffords while she was in Congress. “It is kind of unbelievable to think five years has gone by,” Kelly said in a telephone conference call with reporters on Thursday. “In some ways, it feels like it has been a long time.” Giffords interjected, “A long time.” Kelly continued. “And in many ways, it feels like it was yesterday.” “Like yesterday,” Giffords said. Though Giffords' right side is paralyzed, she continues to improve through intensive therapy, Kelly said. In November, she completed the 40-mile charity bike tour in Tucson, despite breaking a femur while training. Her goal this year, Kelly said, was to take up horseback riding. She had learned riding as a child and had competed, he said. The two were in Washington, D.C., and at the White House this week when President Barack Obama announced executive actions to strengthen background checks for gun purchasers. “Personally, for both Gabby and I, it was very satisfying to see all of this come together,” Kelly said. Daniel Hernandez, who was a Giffords intern at the time of the shooting, and who put pressure on her gunshot wound to stave off blood loss, said the Obama announcement brought some joy to survivors during a week that annually brings more grief than most. “It provided a small reprieve,” he said. “It allowed us to have this moment of odd celebration.” Hernandez, who stood behind Obama at the White House when he made his announcement, said the small steps Obama announced were not a panacea for gun violence but represented “a step in the right direction.” AZCENTRAL Arizonans take part in televised Obama gun control town-hall event Ken Dorushka, who took a bullet to the forearm while trying to keep his wife from being shot, said he was with other Tucson survivors recording an interview at a Tucson public-television station when Obama made his announcement. They watched it together. “It was wonderful to see some positive action has taken place after years of inaction,” Dorushka said. He said it was the opposite of the frustration he felt when Arizona’s Legislature, in the session following the 2011 shooting, voted to make the Colt .45 the official state gun. Former Rep. Ron Barber, who worked in Giffords' congressional office at the time of her shooting, remembered that he remained conscious after being shot outside the Safeway. He saw the rest of the shooting take place in front of him. Barber, who held Giffords' House seat for one term, said the political talk around the gun issue had hardened over the years. Barber has continued his mission of trying to improve the quality of political discourse. “If our leaders can’t show they can get along,” Barber said, “then the population won’t get the leadership it needs.” Maisch said the Tucson shooting has almost been lost in the wave of mass shootings around the country. Her phone used to ring after other mass shootings, with reporters wanting to get her reaction. ""They don’t call as much as they used to,” she said. “There’s too many.” On days like these, Maisch said, politicians often send their thoughts and prayers. “Thoughts and prayers are a pile of crap,” she said. “Action is what we need from them.” Maisch was in the Senate gallery in 2013 when lawmakers failed to pass a bill requiring background checks at gun shows. She shouted “shame on you” to senators and was escorted out by security. Maisch said on Friday that she was given a two-hour background check following that incident. “But they said no to a two-minute background check for an instrument of destruction,” she said. Maisch was the first to meet Teves, after the Aurora, Colo., shooting in 2012. Teves wanted to attend a town hall meeting with Sen. John McCain. Someone from the advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns put her in touch with Maisch and other Tucson survivors. Maisch drove up to attend the McCain town hall with her. At the town hall, Teves introduced herself, explained how her son was killed, and asked McCain, R-Ariz., to introduce a bill banning assault-style weapons. McCain, she said, told the crowd there was no political will for such a measure. Teves recalled some of the crowd cheered and whooped. Teves said she hears gun-rights advocates spin scenarios about what could have been done differently at the movie theater, speculating the incident might have ended more quickly if someone else had been armed, for example. Such speculation, while ignoring the fact the Aurora gunman wore full body armor, seems to dismiss Teves’ pain, she said. Teves recalled that hospital officials told her it would be best not to look at her son. The military-style bullet that entered his head — a full metal jacket, she said — destroyed the back of his skull. “We never got to see him to say goodbye,” she said while beginning to cry. “I don’t want another parent to have to tell the story of how their child had their head blown off. Enough already.” Republic writer Karina Bland continued to this article.

81,http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_29364362/cow-palace-gun-show-draws-crowd-wake-obamas?source=rss,"Trending: DALY CITY — A long line of gun fanciers waiting to buy tickets snaked across the Cow Palace parking lot early Saturday morning despite a cold drizzle, as the Crossroads of the West gun show kicked off a two-day run at the famed exhibition hall. Judging by the size of the morning crowd, show owner Bob Templeton predicted total weekend attendance of about 7,000 — double the usual 3,500 at the show he’s been holding at the Cow Palace for three decades. “There are a lot of first-time buyers,” said Templeton, a Utah resident. “They’re here for two reasons — the safety of their family and President Obama’s call for more gun control” earlier in the week. The sprawling exhibit hall was packed with vendors selling everything from ear plugs and T-shirts to kits that allow you to make your own AR-15 semi-automatics. An unscientific sampling of attendees failed to find anyone opposed to the background checks at gun shows proposed by the president — such checks are already California law — but many said they were suspicious that he is opposed to all gun ownership, despite his insistence that he’s not. “Obama can’t be trusted,” said Greg Simkins of Oakley, who was thinking about buying one of the AR-15 kits, made by United Armory. “He’ll push his agenda no matter what.” Some said they keep their gun ownership to themselves, especially in the liberal Bay Area. “I don’t tell my neighbors,” said Rich from Oakland, who declined to give his last name. “It feels like I’m part of a minority,” said Joe, who was also reluctant to say where he lives. A $13 ticket gained entrance to the expo, where shoppers looked for deals on ammunition and browsed tables of historical weapons. The AR-15 kit — essentially the barrel of the popular line of semi-automatic rifles — is not regulated because it’s sold without the receiver, a vital part. It can be purchased separately, but it must be milled by the buyer to make it workable. Bob Zider, of Portola Valley, said he doesn’t own a gun but has been trying to convince his wife that guns can be safely owned. “I didn’t find anything here that would make me comfortable,” he said. Zider left with some T-shirts — but no guns. David Leeds, a historic-firearms dealer from San Francisco, said he fears that modest regulation only begets more. “It’s like abortion in Texas,” he said, standing beside his tables full of vintage guns. “I think abortion should be legal. In Texas they regulated it out of existence. You got a slippery slope.” The crowd was mostly male, but there were some couples. “We’re mostly here for ammo,” said Cory Robbins, of Pacifica. Robbins said stores have sold out of ammunition. The run on ammo appears to have followed both the San Bernardino mass shooting on Dec. 2 and Obama’s executive actions this past week. “There’s nothing on the shelves, and the prices are better here,” he said. “You can haggle sometimes, and there’s always a part for a gun, maybe a kit.” Robbins’ wife, Catherine, said shooting is a family affair. She said her son, now a teenager, has been shooting since he was 3 years old. “You teach them at a young age how to clean and store it — and start them with little nerf guns.” But, she said, some of her friends disapprove. “It is hard sometimes,” she said. “I have a lot of friends who don’t like guns.” Contact Pete Carey at 408-920-5419.

A pair of Lakeville students died in a pickup truck rollover the week after Thanksgiving. The day after Christmas, Columbia Heights siblings were killed in a snowy car crash. Family tragedies ripple quickly to school buildings, where teachers and staff are increasingly practiced at making schools safe havens for mourning students. With crisis management plans, a majority of schools turn into command centers to help young people cope with grief they may have never before experienced. “There are not many things in education that you say you get one chance at to do right,” said Tim Dorway, Chanhassen High School principal. “Helping students and staff and parents cope with tragedy of the loss of a student is one of them.” Responses to student death have become more focused as school officials have learned from tragic experiences that have hit schools elsewhere, such as mass murders and active shooters, said Rick Kaufman, Bloomington schools spokesman. He is well-experienced in crisis management, after leading the response team in the Colorado district where Columbine High School is located when the mass shooting happened there in 1999. First steps Most plans include a series of tasks: Get the facts, convene a team, prepare statements, seek out the most affected students and staff and decide what resources are needed. At Chanhassen High School, when the district gets word of a student’s death, a crisis team is pulled together that includes administrators, a school resource officer and counselors. The team turns to its checklist — notifying people close to the student, deciding on a time for an emergency staff meeting that doesn’t send others into a panic and then making the announcement. “You go from condolences and emotion to action fairly quickly,” Dorway said. The announcement is a typed statement that a teacher will read to each classroom — it isn’t done over the intercom. Team members divvy up other roles, such as providing grief support, helping teachers make the announcement and maybe assigning staff members to follow the missing student’s schedule through the rest of the day. If the death is a suicide, Bloomington’s school psychologists and counselors step in to help colleagues and students guard against potential copycat acts, Kaufman said. The evening when students at Lakeville South High School found out two of their peers had been killed, the district knew students would likely be coming back to school; it was a natural gathering point for students who had just left for the weekend, district spokeswoman Amy Olson said. The auditorium and commons held students from both Lakeville South and Lakeville North that night, she said. There, the students cried and hugged; teachers and counselors were nearby for support. Then Lakeville South students expressed themselves in a longtime school tradition, Olson said: painting a boulder outside the school with initials of the students who had died. The nuances, the aftermath Moving from the initial response to the recovery stages is often difficult, Kaufman said. “We do tend to move on and want to move on quicker,” he said. “But grief knows no time limit.” In the aftermath, Chanhassen pays attention to details, said the school’s dean, Erin Swoboda. Taking roll, for example. If a student who dies is marked absent, his grieving parents could get an errant call that night. That student’s parents shouldn’t be on an e-mail list for an announcement about the student, either. “Those little things are critical, too,” she said. Chanhassen High, which opened in 2009 and is still in its infancy, lost two students in 2015. But the way the school community supported itself in the hard times “helped form our culture,” Dorway said. After a student died in April at the school, the students came back to school the next morning and were ready to discuss their loss, Swoboda said. “This was their safe place and where they felt like they should be,” she said.  © 2021 StarTribune.

Absolutely yes. Expanded background checks on gun show purchases are not the repeal of the Second Amendment, as the opponents claim. The background checks will also not prevent all future mass shootings, as no law in existence is 100 percent effective. However, expanded background checks will cause a gradual reduction in the number of illegal firearms in circulation. As a consequence, the number of deaths from gang-related shootings will slowly decrease. All of our First Amendment liberties have modest limitations. Laws against slander are a reasonable constraint on freedom of speech. Similar limits on our Second Amendment rights are urgently needed. Greg Paske Substitute teacher Scottsdale -------------------- Not Really. I believe that the action is mainly political rather than a true good faith effort to reduce gun violence. Very little, if anything, that he has done will actually affect gun ownership by law-abiding citizens, by common criminals or by terrorists. For example, if the president actually wanted the additional agents, he could easily have asked for them in a budget request in the normal course of events — and would more likely have gotten them. Likewise, I believe that the hyped opposition to his actions is unwarranted. The president should work with Congress and not challenge it. When he does, we all lose. Boe James Community enthusiast Fountain Hills -------------------- Yes! Although the real effects of this are expected to be minimal, I believe the president has opened up a conversation about guns that is thankfully not tied to the latest mass shooting. I hope this will enable us to shift the debate away from specific shooting event details and towards solutions. We need to back rhetoric about gun violence with real data. Citizens are tired of this impasse. The president has thrown down the gauntlet, now will Congress act? Suzanne Tveit Retired business consultant Phoenix -------------------- No. I believe that gun registration and restricting “big clip” assault weapons is good. Unfortunately, neither of these actions will stop crazy people from killing others. We are bombarded with violent movies, TV, video games and rap music. These mediums are protected by the First Amendment, yet contribute to our violent society. Unless we are willing to increase the investigative and penal laws (i.e. Stop and Frisk, Kate’s law, and mandatory minimum sentences for gun related crimes) we will not benefit from additional gun controls. And that’s where the problem lies. Criminals do​​ not care about gun control laws.

Nikki Haley struck a similar note to President Barack Obama in her response to his State of the Union address Tuesday night when she spoke about welcoming immigrants regardless of race or religion. In her official Republican address to the nation, Haley spoke about her own experience as the child of Indian immigrants and emphasized that immigration is part of America’s history. “Immigrants have been coming to our shores for generations to live the dream that is America,” she said. “No one should feel unwelcome.” Still, she added that the United States needed to stop immigrants entering the country illegally and to vet those coming legally to ensure national security. “We must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined,” Haley said. Ultimately, Haley called on Americans to not be swept up in the “angriest” voices, and said the country should welcome “properly vetted legal immigrants regardless of their race or religion.” This seemed like a clear reference to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, who called for a total ban on Muslims entering the U.S. in December. Original story: U.S. President Barack Obama gave his final presidential State of the Union Tuesday evening in a rousing address that focused on the future of the country, but that won’t be the last speech of the night. Soon after, representing the opposite side of the ideological aisle, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will deliver the Republican rebuttal. You can watch the response live here. Haley gained national political clout last summer for acting quickly to remove the Confederate battle flag from her state’s statehouse grounds after a racially charged mass shooting at a predominantly black church in Charleston. The GOP response to the president’s remarks show that she’s a rising politician in the party, joining several leaders who have responded to the president after State of the Union speeches, including presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla., and the current speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. .@nikkihaley has led an economic turnaround &amp; set a bold agenda for SC. I&#39;m looking forward to her #SOTU response. https://t.co/H3PwdLMs8v Since the flag’s removal, Haley has been mentioned as a potential vice presidential running mate for whoever is the eventual nominee. While that prospect is quite a ways away, she has indicated that she would be open to the idea. Haley is currently serving her second term as governor of South Carolina. She was the first woman to be elected to the office and is one of the youngest governors in the country. Her handling of the flag incident was not the first time she received good press — at least not in her home state. She received the largest margin of victory for her re-election in the past 24 years and has overseen jobless rates hitting record lows, according to her official biography. Haley’s time in office, aside from the flag removal, has been defined by tax cuts for small businesses and education reforms. She is the daughter of Indian immigrants and is married to a captain in the Army National Guard. She has two teenage children. -International Business Times staff writer Abigail Abrams contributed to this story.",2016-01-12 21:43:26,Who Is Nikki Haley?

92,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/jan/13/believe-again-obama-urges-nation/,"WASHINGTON — In his final State of the Union address, President Barack Obama urged Americans to rekindle their belief in the promise of change that first carried him into the White House. State's D.C. six criticize address Arkansans reveal who got their tickets to State of the Union speech State's D.C. six criticize address Arkansans reveal who got their tickets to State of the Union speech “It’s easier to be cynical, to accept that change isn’t possible and politics is hopeless,” Obama said. “But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. “The future we want,” he insisted, “is within our reach.” But opportunity and security for American families “will only happen if we work together … if we fix our politics.” The nation’s goals must include “a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids,” he said. The president used his final State of the Union address to pose “four big questions” about the future of the country. “Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people?” Obama said. “Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?” Obama’s questions began with one about the economy — “How do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?” Another asked how the U.S. could solve technological problems like curing cancer and halting climate change. Another asked how the U.S. could avoid becoming the world’s policeman. And the fourth asked how Americans could learn to reason together, giving up the bitter gridlock of today’s Washington. “We’ve made progress,” Obama said, in answering the first question. “But we need to make more.” Obama warned against “voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background.” Obama ticked through a retrospective of his domestic and foreign-policy actions in office, including helping lead the economy back from the brink of depression, taking aggressive action on climate change and ending a Cold War-era freeze with Cuba. Yet he was frank about failing to ease the deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans. “The rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,” he conceded. “There’s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I’ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.” Those sentiments echoed comments he made during an interview that aired earlier Tuesday on the Today show. Obama said “it’s a regret” that he was not able to do more to bring the country together politically. “But I’m pretty confident that the overwhelming majority of Americans are looking for the kind of politics that does feed our hopes and not our fears, that does work together and doesn’t try to divide, that isn’t looking for simplistic solutions and scapegoating but looks for us buckling down and figuring out, ‘How do we make things work for the next generation?’” Obama said. His words were echoed by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was selected to give the Republican response to Obama’s address. Underscoring how the heated campaign rhetoric about immigration and minority groups from GOP candidate Donald Trump, in particular, has unnerved some Republican leaders, Haley called on Americans to resist the temptation “to follow the siren call of the angriest voices.” “No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome,” Haley said. GAS PRICES, GLOBAL WARMING Obama opened his address with a few ad-libbed jokes about the political race to pick his successor. Promising to keep his address short, he drew cheers and laughter when he noted that some of the legislators in the audience were antsy to get back to Iowa, home of the nation’s first caucuses. And he returned to the topic of gasoline prices — the subject of many past Republican attacks — with a line that noted how low the prices had gone. “Under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad,” Obama said. Mindful of the election year, Obama avoided the traditional litany of policy proposals. White House officials said before his speech that he was planning a “nontraditional” speech that would offer a broad, long-term view of the nation. Obama reiterated his call for working with Republicans on criminal justice changes and finalizing an Asia-Pacific trade pact, and he vowed to keep pushing for action on curbing gun violence and fixing the nation’s immigration laws. He touted his efforts to fight global warming, saying those who doubt that global warming is occurring are welcome to “have at it,” but they will end up “pretty lonely.” He said they’ll be on the opposite side of the military, most businesses, a majority of Americans and almost all scientists. He touched upon the global climate pact that the U.S. and other nations around the world reached in Paris in December, saying it reflects that climate change is a problem that must be solved. The president said investing in climate solutions is also a chance for U.S. businesses to produce “the energy of the future.” He was pointing to wind and solar technology. Making an overture to new House Speaker Paul Ryan, Obama highlighted the Republican’s interest in fighting poverty. Obama said he’d welcome “a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.” The president noted, however, that there are plenty of other areas where it’s more difficult to find agreement between Republicans and Democrats. He said those include what role the government should play in making sure the system works for ordinary Americans, not just the wealthy. About 30 minutes into the address, Ryan’s office released a statement saying Obama’s speech “isn’t going so well.” “Lofty platitudes and nostalgic rhetoric may make for nice sound bites, but they don’t explain how to” solve problems, such as defeating the Islamic State terrorist group, fixing social safety net programs or getting the economy back on track,” Ryan said. Obama’s speech “isn’t a real path forward to restore a confident America,” he added. “We can do so much better.” Part of Obama’s address focused on the fight against the Islamic State. He promised a campaign to “take out” the Islamic State and chastised Republicans for “over-the-top claims” about the extremist group’s power. “As we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger and must be stopped,” he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “But they do not threaten our national existence.” Obama criticized those who say the Islamic State represents Islam. He called that a lie and said rhetoric like that pushes away allies the U.S. needs to win the fight against the militants. Obama was eager to look beyond his own presidency, casting the actions he’s taken as a springboard for future economic progress and national security. “The United States of America is the most powerful nation on earth. Period,” he declared. “It’s not even close.” In the GOP response, Haley touched upon many of the same topics as the president. She called on Americans to resist “the siren call of the angriest voices” in how the nation treats immigrants. The U.S.-born daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley said the country is facing its most dangerous security threat since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. That was a reference to the Islamic State, which has taken credit for attacks in Paris and elsewhere and may have inspired last month’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. “During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,” Haley, mentioned by some as a potential vice presidential candidate this year, said in her party’s formal response to Obama. “We must resist that temptation.” The nation’s youngest governor at 43, Haley also seemed to try to smooth some of her party’s more combative edges. She said Republicans “would respect differences in modern families” and said it isn’t necessary “to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference.” Without offering specifics, she said that while Democrats bear much responsibility, Republicans “need to accept that we’ve played a role in how and recognize why our government is broken.” Haley said the U.S. should continue admitting “properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion” — an apparent reference to calls by Trump to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. She also hewed closely to GOP demands in the immigration debate, saying: “That does not mean we just flat out open our borders,” and said the U.S. should refuse entry to refugees “whose intentions cannot be determined.” Information for this article was contributed by Julie Pace of The Associated Press; and by Juliet Eilperin and David A.

January 13, 2016 On State of the Union night, an extraordinary thing happened: The Democratic president and the Republican tasked with responding to his address issued the same message. On matters of policy, from the economy to education to terrorism, President Obama and Gov. Nikki Haley (R) of South Carolina predictably disagreed. But on the broader issue of the state of public discourse, and America’s increasingly diverse identity, they could have finished each other’s sentences. Both, in their own way, implicitly went after the loudest voice in the political arena: Donald Trump, front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, whose calls to ban Muslims from entering the country and harsh rhetoric against illegal immigrants have dismayed both Democrats and the Republican establishment. But it wasn’t just about Mr. Trump. In their common plea for civility and cooler heads, Mr. Obama and Governor Haley each called on other forces to pay heed – the parties, the public, and, by implication, the media. The optics of the night’s two speakers – America’s first black president and the Indian-American female governor of a Southern state – could not have been more profound. “Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention,” Obama said. “As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background,” Obama continued.  “We can’t afford to go down that path.” Haley, like Obama, struck a hopeful tone about the future of the country, even as she called for a new direction this November. Then she turned her sights on the public discourse, speaking for a party anxious about growing its appeal beyond older white voters. “Today, we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory. During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,” said Haley, who has been touted as a possible vice presidential candidate. Later in the speech, she returned to the theme. “Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference. That's just not true,” said Haley, speaking from her state capital, Columbia. “Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.” Haley spoke of her upbringing in rural South Carolina as the child of Indian immigrants, in a family that “didn’t look like our neighbors” but believed in the American dream all the same. Then she recounted the tragedy that took place in her state last June, the mass shooting of churchgoers in Charleston. The shooter, she said, didn’t look or act like them, but still they prayed with him. Then he began shooting, taking “nine incredible souls.” “Our state was struck with shock, pain and fear, but our people would not allow hate to win,” Haley said. “We didn't have violence, we had vigils. We didn't have riots, we had hugs. We didn't turn against each other's race or religion, we turned toward God, and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world.” Haley’s handling of the tragedy – which led to the historic lowering of the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the state capitol – won her national notice and growing talk that she could wind up the GOP ticket, depending on who wins the nomination. Charleston was a breakout moment for Obama, too. In his eulogy for the victims, the president broke into song, leading the congregation in a rendition of “Amazing Grace” and producing one of the iconic moments of his presidency. Tuesday was also a night for mea culpas. For Obama, it was a moment to take blame upon himself for failing to deliver on his promise of national unity. “It's one of the few regrets of my presidency – that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,” Obama said. “I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office,” he continued. For Haley, the mea culpa came in the form of a scolding aimed at her own party. “While Democrats in Washington bear much responsibility for the problems facing America today, they do not bear it alone. There is more than enough blame to go around,” she said. “We as Republicans need to own that truth. We need to recognize our contributions to the erosion of the public trust in America's leadership. We need to accept that we've played a role in how and why our government is broken. And then we need to fix it.” Whether these two speeches make a difference will depend on how leaders of both parties going forward handle their opportunities. Obama has another year in office, and while he went light on proposals for the Republican-controlled Congress, he could have some surprises in store.

On Tuesday night, Obama spoke of Speaker Ryan’s interest in tackling poverty, and said he would “welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support.” The president mentioned a proposal to expand tax cuts for low-income workers who don’t have children. Whether Obama and Ryan can work together on issues beyond those already on the agenda remains to be seen. In a presidential election year, the odds can be long. But in Tuesday’s calls for cooler rhetoric, and more bipartisanship, Obama and Haley may have opened a door. Already a subscriber?

And often they deliver results. Loading... January 13, 2016 The widow of a man killed in the Dec. 2nd San Bernardino shootings is suing the county for $58 million. Michael Wetzel was attending a holiday luncheon at the Inland Regional Center on where he worked as an environmental health specialist for San Bernardino County when he was killed in a mass shooting orchestrated by Syed Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik. Now Michael’s widow, Renee Wetzel, has filed four claims against the county. She is seeking $3 million for loss of wages, $25 million for general damages, and $10 million for each of her three young children for a total of $58 million. Post-violence lawsuits by grieving family members are not uncommon. And often they deliver results. In May 2014, Elliot Rodger fatally stabbed three men and then fatally shot another three at an apartment complex near the University of California at Santa Barbara campus. The families of three of Mr. Rodger’s victims filed a federal suit in March alleging that the county, sheriff’s department and apartment building, failed to take action against Rodger’s dangerous “red flags.” The victims’ families inspired a new California law, effective Jan. 1, under which family members can ask a judge for a gun violence restraining order. When such an order is issued the relative must temporarily surrender all of their firearms from anywhere between 21 days to a year. Under this new law, family members and law enforcement would have had legal jurisdiction to seize Rodger's weapons after his therapist and parents said he was a dangerous threat. With the new law, “all of this could have been prevented” says Bob Weiss, whose 19-year-old daughter, Veronika, was killed by Rodger. Attorneys Stanton T. Matthews and Andrew J. Nissen who are representing Renee Wetzel and her three children have not yet elaborated on the specific details of the negligence claims in the San Bernardino case. “Claimants allege the decedent’s death was preventable and caused by the negligent and careless actions of respondents and each of them,” says Renee’s vague claim, which lists the county and 25 individuals as responsible for Michael’s death. The country confirms that Renee’s claims are the only ones filed thus far. “The county will carefully consider each claim and act in the best interests of everyone involved,” county spokesman David Wert said in a statement Tuesday.

100,http://www.mercurynews.com/politics-government/ci_29375400/gop-response-obamas-speech-softens-candidates-tough-stance?source=rss,"Trending: WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans should resist “the siren call of the angriest voices” in how the nation treats immigrants, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said as the GOP used its response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address to try softening the tough stance embraced by some of its leading presidential candidates. Haley, herself the U.S.-born daughter of Indian immigrants, said Tuesday that the country is facing its most dangerous security threat since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. That was a reference to the Islamic State group, which has taken credit for attacks in Paris and elsewhere and may have inspired last month’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. “During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,” she said in excerpts of her party’s formal response, which was released early by Republicans. “We must resist that temptation.” Haley, who has been mentioned by some as a potential GOP vice presidential candidate this year, has risen in national prominence for helping to end the display of the Confederate battle flag on Statehouse grounds last year after half a century. She also gained attention following last June’s slaying of nine people at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and catastrophic flooding that battered her state in October. The nation’s youngest governor at 43, Haley said no one who works hard and follows the laws “should ever feel unwelcome in this country.” In the excerpts, Haley did not mention the GOP presidential race. But the front-runner so far, Donald Trump, has called for deporting millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Two other contenders, Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, have battled over which of them has the tougher record on the issue. Polls have shown public concerns over terrorism and national security have become a top issue ever since the November attacks that killed 130 in Paris and the December mass shooting by a radicalized Muslim couple that killed 14 people in San Bernardino. Ever since, Republicans on the presidential campaign trail and in Congress have been emphasizing the issues. “This president appears either unwilling or unable to deal with” the terrorist threat, Haley said in remarks that broadly described how Republicans would do things differently than Democrats if they win the White House and retain control of Congress. “Soon, the Obama presidency will end and America will have the chance to turn in a new direction.” At the same time, many in the GOP feel the party must do a better job of appealing to Hispanics and other minority voters if they are to compete effectively in national and many statewide elections. Some feel that Trump is so divisive that he could not only lose the presidential election if nominated but cost the GOP seats in Congress. They’re also eager to win more votes from women, who preferred Obama over his Republican opponents by more than 10 percentage points in his 2008 and 2012 elections and have favored the Democratic presidential candidate in each election since 1992. Haley is the third consecutive woman GOP leaders have chosen to deliver their party’s response to Obama. Freshman Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, gave the address last year and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., the No. 4 House GOP leader, did it in 2014. Twenty-nine of the 300 GOP members of Congress, or about 10 percent, are women, about one-third the proportion of women among congressional Democrats. Each party also has three female governors, although GOP governors outnumber Democrats 31 to 18, plus an independent. Haley said the nation’s problems also include an economy that’s not boosted family income, a national debt that’s too high and Obama’s health care law, which Republicans have long asserted has failed. She also cited “chaotic unrest in many of our cities,” which seemed a reference to community anger in several cities over killings by police of unarmed black people. She said under a GOP president, Republicans would lower taxes, curb spending and debt and strengthen the military. “We would make international agreements that were celebrated in Israel and protested in Iran, not the other way around,” she said, a reference to a treaty Obama and other nations negotiated with Iran to restrict its nuclear program that Republicans solidly oppose.

(Brennan Linsley, Associated Press) Two teen girls in Colorado have been charged as adults, accused of plotting a mass shooting at their high school near Denver, according to news reports. Brooke Higgins, 16, was arraigned Thursday in Douglas County District Court, Reuters reports. Her alleged accomplice, Sienna Johnson, 16, was arraigned last week. Both are charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder at Mountain Vista High School, located in Highlands Ranch, Colo. ""They planned together to do this mass shooting,"" Jason Siers, senior chief deputy district attorney, tells the Denver Post. The case is gaining national attention because it's unusual for females to be accused of plotting or be involved in a mass shooting. According to Mother Jones, since 1982, only three of 84 mass shootings (four or more deaths) have involved females, including the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December. Prosecutors accuse Higgins of searching the internet for ways to purchase guns as a minor and also looking for information on female mass shooters. She also wrote in a journal that she wished she could have participated in the 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado that left 12 students and a teacher dead, the Post reports. The plot was discovered in December after a text was sent to the county sheriff's office. Higgins' lawyer, Dagny Van Der Jagt, tells the Post that the teens are guilty of ""thought crime"" at worst, pointing out that no weapons were found in her home. She said Higgins is being treated for depression. But prosecutors say the girls had specific targets and were fascinated by the movie ""Natural Born Killers"", the Guardian reports. Johnson reportedly made detailed maps of the high school, including where deputies assigned to protect the building were located. The girls also posted pictures on social media sites depicting blood-spattered walls, prosecutors say. Both girls are being held in jail on $1 million bonds.  A judge could still rule that the girls be tried as juveniles, reports say.

102,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/15/less-news-is-good-news-oliver-burkeman,"Technology connects us to more and more of the world’s suffering, of which there’s an essentially infinite amount Last modified on Tue 19 Jun 2018 12.33 BST A few days before Christmas, feeling rather furtive about it, I went on a media diet: I quietly unsubscribed from, unfollowed or otherwise disconnected from several people and news sources whose output, I’d noticed, did nothing but bring me down. This felt like defeat. I’ve railed against the popular self-help advice that you should “give up reading the news” on the grounds that it’s depressing and distracting: if bad stuff’s happening out there, my reasoning goes, I don’t want to live in an artificial bubble of privilege and positivity; I want to face reality. But at some point during 2015’s relentless awfulness, it became unignorable: the days when I read about another mass shooting, another tale of desperate refugees or anything involving the words “Donald Trump” were the days I’d end up gloomier, tetchier, more attention-scattered. Needless to say, I channelled none of this malaise into making the planet better. I just got grumbly about the world, like a walking embodiment of that bumper-sticker: “Where are we going, and why are we in this handbasket?” One problem is that merely knowing that the news focuses disproportionately on negative and scary stories doesn’t mean you’ll adjust your emotions accordingly. People like me scorn Trump and the Daily Mail for sowing unwarranted fears. We know that the risk of dying in traffic is vastly greater than from terrorism. We may even know that US gun crime is in dramatic decline, that global economic inequality is decreasing, or that there’s not much evidence that police brutality is on the rise. (We just see more of it, thanks to smartphones.) But, apparently, the part of our minds that knows these facts isn’t the same part that decides whether to feel upbeat or despairing. It’s entirely possible to know things are pretty good, yet feel as if they’re terrible.  This phenomenon has curious parallels with the “busyness epidemic”. Data on leisure time suggests we’re not much busier than we were, yet we feel busier, partly because – for “knowledge workers”, anyway – there’s no limit to the number of emails we can get, the demands that can be made of us, or the hours of the day we can be in touch with the office. Work feels infinite, but our capacities are finite, therefore overwhelm is inevitable. Similarly, technology connects us to more and more of the world’s suffering, of which there’s an essentially infinite amount, until feeling steamrollered by it becomes structurally inevitable – not a sign that life’s getting worse. And the consequences go beyond glumness. They include “compassion fade”, the well-studied effect whereby our urge to help the unfortunate declines as their numbers increase. This isn’t an argument for avoiding news entirely: I certainly don’t, and neither should you. (Take it from an unbiased journalist.) It’s just an argument for carefully pruning your incoming information streams, balancing the importance of staying informed against a pointless gloom that helps no one. You don’t want to shut out reality. But 24/7 exposure to everything purporting to be news these days isn’t “reality”. It paints a picture that’s equally fake – and way, way more stressful.",2016-01-15 10:00:11,Is less news good news?,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

104,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/jan/17/cotton-on-go-to-list-for-tv-news-shows-/,"WASHINGTON -- When terrorists strike and ayatollahs rage, national media outlets are increasingly turning to Arkansas' U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton for his opinion on foreign policy, national security and defense issues. 2 report 1st year in D.C. splendid 2 report 1st year in D.C. splendid As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence, Cotton has access to key information when a crisis is unfolding. And Cotton -- Harvard-educated, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran -- is using his position to speak out on foreign policy, as evidenced Saturday when he spoke about Iran's prisoner exchange and Taiwan's presidential election. ""I try to speak out on issues on which I have some expertise and experience, and it just so happens that as the chickens have come to roost from Barack Obama's foreign policy and the world has grown more dangerous, that security issues have risen to the forefront,"" he said. In his first year in the U.S. Senate, the Republican from Dardanelle has appeared on the Sunday morning news shows at least five times, snaring invitations to speak on NBC's Meet the Press, ABC's This Week and CNN's State of the Union, plus two sessions on CBS' Face the Nation. On Tuesday, just hours before President Obama's State of the Union address to Congress, Cotton was standing in front of a CNN camera in the Russell Senate Office Building, denouncing Iran for seizing American sailors and accusing Tehran of trying to upstage Obama's big speech. ""Rarely are matters coincidental when you're dealing with the ayatollahs in Iran. First off, it's humiliating to Barack Obama and therefore the United States to have American sailors held hostage during his final State of the Union,"" he told a televised audience. Cotton's criticism is familiar to foreign governments and to the White House. Shortly after taking office in January 2015, Cotton captured headlines by sending Iranian officials a letter warning them that any deal they reached with Obama could be rescinded on Jan. 20, 2017 -- the day the next president takes office. Forty-six Senate Republican colleagues added their signatures to Cotton's message, which was promptly posted on social media and distributed around the world. Since then, Cotton has gotten a national platform to speak out on a number of other issues. CNN's Wolf Blitzer, for example, routinely invites Cotton to appear live on his program. In September and October, he quizzed Cotton about the war in Syria. He invited Cotton back in early November after Islamic extremists claimed responsibility for downing a Russian jet over the Sinai Peninsula. By mid-November, Blitzer was questioning Cotton about the coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris. Other CNN anchormen turned to Cotton in December, asking him about the White House's response to the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and U.S. John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, have both encouraged him to speak out, Cotton said. He says it's easier to be heard now that he's moved from the 435-member House to the 100-member Senate. He served one term in the House of Representatives. The Senate position ""has allowed me to be a stronger advocate for Arkansans than I could be in the House,"" he said in an interview. ""I resolved early on that I wasn't going to let Arkansas' voice be muffled here."" As a lawmaker, one of his priorities is to increase defense spending and ensure that funding for the Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville continues. ""The world's growing more dangerous almost every day, and our military has been drastically cut over the last seven years, strained almost to the breaking point,"" he said. Although Cotton is the youngest and one of the newest members of the Senate, U.S. Sen. John Boozman, the senior senator from Arkansas, says Cotton has quickly become a leader on issues of vital importance. ""He has a tremendous interest in national security and has done a great job of really focusing in on it,"" said Boozman, a Republican from Rogers. ""He's essentially visiting with everyone who's anyone in the national security sphere. ... He has worked very, very hard to not only look at current events and current leadership and current analysts, but he's gone back as many years as he could and looked at people that have been around for a long time, looking at these issues."" Political commentator and Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, a longtime Cotton supporter, said he's impressed by the freshman senator. ""Cotton's had a remarkable first year. The key has been his hard work on the substance of policy in key areas. His colleagues, the administration and the press all know when they deal with Cotton they're getting a well-informed and well-thought ... argument, not talking points. He's also been able to disagree not just with Democrats but with establishment Republicans at times without being disagreeable,"" Kristol said in an email. In a presidential election year, Cotton could end up as the party's vice presidential nominee, Kristol said. ""He's an obvious VP possibility this year. Who else combines as well youth and gravitas?"" he said. Democrats are less enthusiastic about the junior senator. ""He's no Dale Bumpers, that's for sure, or a David Pryor or a Mark Pryor,"" said Democratic Party of Arkansas spokesman H.L. Moody. ""Somehow, Cotton convinced the people of Arkansas that he was speaking for them when actually he's just toeing the line for the special interests in Washington, D.C."" Since arriving on Capitol Hill, Cotton has traveled extensively, including a trip over the holidays to meet with government leaders in Burma and Thailand. Before returning to the U.S., he also stopped in Japan and met with U.S. troops stationed there. There's still a reservoir of goodwill for America in the nations he visits, but there's also apprehension, fears that the U.S. isn't as engaged as it once was, Cotton said. ""What I've seen in my conversations one-on-one with heads of state and foreign ministers is a desire to have stronger relationships with the United States but also a real concern that the United States is not playing its traditional postwar role in the world,"" Cotton said. Members of the military are also concerned, he said. ""They're proud to be serving in the United States military ... but I do hear lots of reservations and doubts about the defense budget and about the choices the president has made in our foreign policy,"" Cotton said. Asked what is most difficult about his new job, Cotton said, ""I'm not sure I'd say there's anything that's particularly difficult, in part because I contrast it with jobs I've had in the past, whether it's carrying a heavy pack or fighting in Iraq or in Afghanistan or working on our family farm."" Plus, he said, he's aware that many of his constituents have ""jobs that are back-breaking and very challenging."" ""All that said, it's difficult to forge consensus in our system of government,"" Cotton said. That's how the founding fathers intended things to be, he added. ""Our system of government was designed in a way to ensure that if we made big changes, that those changes had widespread and long-standing support among the American people."" Last year, Cotton and his wife, Anna, became parents for the first time. Their son, Gabriel, turns 1 in April. ""It's been a lot of fun. He changes so rapidly,"" the senator said. ""It brings a new perspective to life and makes life a lot sweeter and reminds you why we're here in the long-term.""

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., went head to head Sunday while Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley remained in the shadows during the last Democratic presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses. Much of the debate in Charleston, S.C., spurred Sanders and Clinton to grapple with one another. Both candidates were repeatedly ask to respond to one another's policies, as well as attacks they may have made against each other in recent weeks. As the two sparred, O'Malley was mostly lost in the fray.
Advertisement Gun control Sanders was asked to answer for his reversed position on immunity from prosecution for gun manufacturers, which he had previously voted against in 2005. He vowed the position was not a reversal and called Clinton's recent attacks on his gun control record ""disingenuous.""
RELATED Sanders endorsed by Black Lives Matter activist Sanders touted his D minus voting rating from the National Rifle Association. Clinton responded by doubling down her attacks, calling out Sanders' vote against the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks for gun purchasers. O'Malley called both candidates inconsistent on the matter, and vowed he was the only one not to change sides on the issue.
Advertisement Last year's mass shooting at Charleston Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal took place just across the street from the Gaillard Center where Sunday's debate took place. Citing the massacre, and the police shooting of   unarmed Walter Scott, the topic of the evening shifted to racial injustice against African Americans.
RELATED Sanders campaign puts DNC lawsuit on ice Last week, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C. -- the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus -- endorsed Clinton. Sanders was asked what losing that endorsement meant for him. Sanders responded by touting numbers showing him inching past Clinton in a recent Iowa poll, and a New Hampshire poll showing him nabbing a 13-point lead over the former secretary of state. Criminal justice reform
RELATED Clinton joins call for end to deportation raids O'Malley -- the former mayor of Baltimore, Md. -- was asked about racial inequality. He responded by citing the creation of a civilian review board in Baltimore, the decriminalization of marijuana possession and his repeal of the death penalty as governor of Maryland.
Advertisement Sanders called for the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate all incidents of police-involved shootings. He also called for demilitarizing police departments, and making departments better reflect their communities. Candidates were asked how they would address America's heroin epidemic. Clinton called for first responders to carry the overdose rescue drug Narcan, and for America to treat drug addiction as a public health problem rather than a crime epidemic. Sanders agreed, adding that drug companies should bear some responsibility for spurring the heroin epidemic. He also called for improved access to mental health treatment.
RELATED Progressive group pushes for ouster of DNC chair NBC cut to commercial before O'Malley could respond to the question. Healthcare reform Clinton was asked about her recent allegations that Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. She held her ground, saying that Sanders wanted to undo decades of work and had no way to pay for his plan of universal healthcare. ""We're not going to tear up the ACA, I helped write it. We're going to build on it,"" Sanders retorted. He said his plan -- introduced just hours before the debate -- would fix problems the Affordable Care Act could not. Clinton shot back, saying Sanders' plan was shot down nine times during his time in the Senate.
Advertisement O'Malley interjected, citing Maryland's use of the ""all-payer"" rate-regulation model as a way of building on the Affordable Care Act. Clinton lauded the model, but then shifted to attacking Sanders once more, saying that starting the debate over healthcare reform from square one would set the nation back. Sanders said the reluctance to move to a universal system was due to pressure from the private insurance industry. Clinton said she had plenty of experience standing up to health insurance companies. She also cited the failure of President Barack Obama's proposed ""public option,"" as evidence that voters did not want universal healthcare. Climate change Sanders said he believes American voters are already changing their habits in response to climate change. He slammed Republicans for denying climate change, saying the denial was due to campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry. He also took aim a Republican front-runner Donald Trump for once saying climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese. O'Malley joined in on mocking Republicans. He went on to endorse his climate change plan.
Advertisement Wall Street reform Sanders elaborated on his aggressive Wall Street strategy of breaking up banks deemed too big to fail. He distinguished his plan from Clinton's, taking a jab at one of her top donors -- Goldman Sachs. Clinton responded by accusing Sanders of not supporting Obama on the Dodd-Frank Act. Sanders said he supported Obama in 2008 and 2012. Clinton retorted that big banks did not want her to be president because of the reforms she has in mind. O'Malley called for re-instituting Glass-Steagall, which imposed a regulatory separation between banking and high-risk investing. It was partially repealed in 1999, a moved blamed by many for the financial crisis in 2008. O'Malley slammed Clinton for her relationship with Wall Street. Clinton responded saying Dodd Frank already allowed the government the authority to break up banks -- a provision Sanders' plan would take advantage of. O'Malley pointed out that authority has never been used. Clinton accused Sanders of voting to deregulate the financial sector. ""We're at least having a vigorous debate about reigning in Wall Street, the Republicans want to give them more power and repeal Dodd-Frank,"" she said.
Advertisement On how he would pay for some of his plans, Sanders called for a tax on Wall Street speculation, among other taxes upon the wealthy and on Wall Street. Clinton said she was the only candidate to promise not to raise taxes on the middle class, and called for taxes on the wealthy to pay for some of her proposals. The moderators asked Sanders to go into more detail on his healthcare policy, citing his earlier promise to only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. Sanders said his plan would eliminate private insurance premiums, and the trade-off would save money for middle class families. Foreign policy Sanders called for normalizing relations with Iran in light of implementation of the Iran nuclear deal. Clinton and Sanders both praised the deal. Clinton took credit for imposing sanctions against Iran, which she argued compelled them to come to the negotiating table. Clinton said the United States should proceed with caution when it comes to Iran. Clinton rejected the idea of deploying ground troops in Syria to combat the Islamic State. She instead supported continued airstrikes, as well as support for the Iraqi and Kurdish armed forces.
Advertisement Sanders went a step further, slamming Republicans who call for ground troops in Syria. He said the United States should have learned from the Iraq war. O'Malley supported Obama's current strategy in the Middle East, which Sanders and Clinton both mirrored. O'Malley also knocked Republicans for using the term ""boots on the ground,"" saying it was dehumanizing to American troops. Sanders said the Islamic State was created by the war in Iraq, and that the United States did not do enough to stabilize the region after the downfall of Saddam Hussein. He called for Middle Eastern countries such as Qatar to foot the bill for combating the Islamic State. In order of priority, he said the destruction of the Islamic State came first, and then deposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. O'Malley said the United States does not know enough to understand the ramifications of regime change. He called for an increased investment in foreign intelligence. Cybersecurity O'Malley said the federal government should get a warrant to compel tech companies to share users' data in an investigation. He defended personal privacy in the digital age, calling for the judicial system to catch up to cybersecurity issues.
Advertisement Sanders echoed sentiments that public policy has not caught up with the digital age. He said Silicon Valley should work with the federal government to target online recruitment from the Islamic State. Clinton said the key to combating lone wolf extremists was to engage Muslim Americans. She slammed anti-Muslim rhetoric by conservative politicians. O'Malley echoed those calls, calling Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump a fascist. He said if Trump wants to start a registry of Muslim Americans, that he could put O'Malley's name first. Sanders called for a shift in defense priorities, saying much of America's defense spending focused on the ""old Cold War."" Clinton's family issues Clinton said she would consult with her husband on economic policy. Sanders fired back: ""If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, you're not going to accomplish much."" Sanders was asked about his previous response to Bill Clinton's extramarital affairs. ""That question annoys me,"" Sanders retorted, insisting he wanted to run an issues-oriented campaign. ""I'm going to debate Secretary Clinton and Gov. O'Malley on the issues facing this country, not on Bill Clinton's personal behavior,"" he said. On what there was no time for Candidates were asked what issues they did not get a chance to discuss. O'Malley said he wanted to discuss immigration reform, specifically immigration detention centers in the United States.

Asa Hutchinson has called for the state to no longer honor Martin Luther King, Jr. on the same day as General Robert E. Lee. The practice continues in Mississippi and Alabama. Loading... January 18, 2016 Holidays to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. and Gen. Robert E. Lee should be ""distinguished and separate,"" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson told state lawmakers last week. The commander of the Confederate Army and the Nobel-Prize-winning civil rights leader were born in two dramatically different centuries, but just four calendar days apart: Jan. 19, 1807, and Jan. 15, 1929, respectively. That coincidence has caused decades-long controversies for states that want to honor them. Today, Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas still commemorate both men with a shared holiday on the third Monday of January, the day most other states — and the federal government — celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. That leaves state politicians and the public to debate whether the combination is a case of bureaucratic efficiency, or an affront to King's anti-racism legacy. A decision to separate the holidays ""would show how far we've come,"" Arkansas State Rep. Fred Love told Reuters. The move would have to be passed in the state legislature, which reconvened Jan. 12. Several other states, including Georgia and Florida, already honor Lee separately. Some say the time for change is ripe given a shift in American attitudes toward Confederate icons over the past year. After the white supremacy-inspired mass shooting of nine black worshipers at Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church last June, ""a systematic dismantling of Confederate symbols [flags, statues, and buildings] has swept across the South,"" as The Christian Science Monitor's Lisa Suhay noted. In South Carolina, many cheered when the state house's Confederate flag was finally furled for good, and Virginians are now asking if Lee-Jackson Day, which honors two Confederate leaders, should be retired. But many say that rewrites history. ""It's cultural cleansing. It's fascism is what that is,"" Sons of Confederate Veterans spokesperson Ben Jones said of motions to end the holiday, celebrated the Friday before Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. It's a popular argument for those who admire Lee's storied personal dignity, or don't believe it's directly contradictory to remember a leader who fought against the Union and opposed black suffrage the same weekend as a civil rights leader who wanted to unite Americans across racial lines. Some say consolidating the holidays is simply more efficient. Others point to the historical timeline: in Arkansas, for instance, Robert E. Lee day was instituted in the 1940s. It wasn't until 1983 that then-President Ronald Reagan somewhat reluctantly signed MLK Day into federal law, and it took nearly 20 years after that for every state in the country to follow suit: New Hampshire, the last in the nation, created an MLK holiday in 1999. The editorial board of the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, however, believes it's time for a change, and that precedent is no excuse. In 1947, the first year the state formally celebrated Lee's birth, ""the movement for civil rights was already at work in Arkansas,"" the editors wrote: It takes little imagination to look inside the minds of lawmakers 82 years after Appomattox Courthouse to see what kind of message they wanted to send in commemorating Lee....Lee was a great leader of men, a man of honor and dedication to his state....[but] No state can honor Martin Luther King Jr. by placing him on the same stage as the general who led the fight to preserve a horrid institution that, had it survived, would have placed King in shackles. As Arkansas considers the change, other states' difficulties to institute MLK Days are a reminder that resistance to honoring the man himself, not only his cause, is far from a Southern-only struggle.

New Hampshire approved Civil Rights Day in 1993, but it took another six years for lawmakers to sign on to a holiday remembering King by name. Similar resistance emerged in Utah. Some attribute it to racism; others, to King's anti-Vietnam War views and controversial aspects of his philosophy. Others say that the progress he fought for is what really deserves honor, more than King's life itself. ""I couldn't accept Civil Rights Day because individuals matter,"" then-N.H. Rep. Arnie Arnesen, who pushed for the MLK bill, told New Hampshire Public Radio. ""Movements don’t exist but for some remarkable human being who inspires change."" Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

In Bergen County, 26 schools were impacted by the threatening messages, Sheriff Michael Saudino told reporters at a news conference in Hackensack. Some of the threats apparently came in an automated, computer-generated call, which was traced to Bakersfield, California. Authorities said they searched schools in at least nine Bergen County towns and one in Passaic County, but found no explosives. The threats forced evacuations and school lockdowns, and prompted a large law enforcement response. ""The message, which was apparently recorded sometime throughout the night, indicated a nonspecific threat to the school district involving the placement of a bomb in one of the schools, as well as a secondary threat of a 'mass shooting,'"" said Clifton police spokesman Detective Sgt. Robert Bracken. The purported attack was set for Tuesday, the message in Clifton claimed. ""There continues to be no credibility to these threats at this time, however, precautions are still being taken throughout the district in response to the situation,"" Bracken added in a statement Tuesday morning. Students at Teaneck High School were moved to the town's community center while other districts -- including Leonia and Garfield -- blocked anyone from entering or leaving the schools as police responded. Garfield Detective Capt. Darren Sucorowski said an overnight threat was left by voicemail at the city's high school. The message, he said, claimed bombs were planted in schools. ""Officers responded and secured all the schools within the school district,"" the captain added. The response in Garfield also drew police from Lodi, Paramus, Passaic, Rochelle Park and Saddle Brook, authorities said. The threat was discovered around 8:20 a.m. and officials lifted the lockdown order around 12:45 p.m. Leonia, Tenafly, Teaneck, Garfield, Fair Lawn, Hackensack, Englewood and Bergenfield schools received the threats, said Bergen County Sheriff's Office spokesman Anthony Cureton. The threats in New Jersey appeared similar to others reported in Delaware and Massachusetts also on Tuesday. Massachusetts State Police said schools in at least ten communities there received bomb threats, some by automated phone calls. In Delaware, three schools received threats Tuesday morning. According to state police, ""a robotic style or computer generated voice phone call was received in each of the school's offices,"" around 9:30 a.m. Authorities have not said if the threats were related to those in New Jersey. The incident was reminiscent of a wave of threats that targeted Bergen County schools and other government buildings in November 2014. Noah Cohen may be reached at ncohen@njadvancemedia.com.

The Mississippi flag has come under fire in recent months because its design incorporates the controversial Confederate symbol -- an image that many now associate with racism.
Advertisement More than 100 people attended the rally Tuesday, including members of the Mississippi Sons of Confederate Veterans, the Dixie Alliance and the Magnolia State Heritage Campaign. Some supporters waived the flag on the south side of the Capitol. The Confederate flag, also called the ""Rebel Flag,"" has taken a beating over the last several months in the wake of last June's mass shooting of nine people at a black South Carolina church. The accused gunman, Dylann Roof, had made several posts online that prominently displayed the Confederate symbol.
RELATED New Orleans City Council votes to remove four prominent Confederate monuments Since the shootings, multiple southern states and businesses have expelled images of the flag from government grounds and retail shops. South Carolina was one of the first to act in that regard. Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn said this week that it's his belief it is time for a new flag. The state legislature could implement such a change or put it on the ballot as a referendum and let voters decide.
Advertisement ""You can't blame what happened in Charleston on this flag,"" Oklahoma resident Andrew Duncomb, who traveled to Jackson for the rally, said. ""That's one sick, demented human being, and you can't judge the rest of all these people (based on that).""
RELATED Univ. of Maryland to nix Byrd name from football stadium over segregationist past Several Mississippi lawmakers also attended the rally in support of the state flag. The most common argument used to support the Confederate symbol claims it is not a representation of racism or hatred, but rather it is a tribute to the South's heritage. ""We should be proud of being in Mississippi and proud of being different, and not just follow suit with everybody else,"" resident Charlotte Webb said. ""We want to keep our flag.""
RELATED Confederate flag supporter accused of bombing Mississippi Walmart ""To be blunt, I refer to it as the American Taliban,"" resident Charles McMichael added. ""We have seen in the Middle East in dictatorial countries where a regime comes in and destroys priceless works of art, statues, status, treasures that belong to all the people of the country. They rob people their culture."" Many critics, though, disagree. Actions to remove the flag or Confederate symbols have been taken in South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana. Also, retailers like Walmart, eBay and Amazon have taken steps to stop the selling of merchandise bearing the Rebel mark.

In addition to the Garden State, The Washington Post reported threats affected schools in Delaware, Maryland, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

	Jon Burlingame “Newtown,” which debuts this weekend at Sundance, has what may be the most ambitious score of any movie in the festival: 17 different composers contributed music, all because they were moved by the subject matter. “Newtown” deals with the aftermath of the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, where 20 first-graders and six staffers were killed in the second-deadliest mass shooting by a gunman in U.S. history. Composer Fil Eisler (“Revenge,” “Empire”), Czech-born but now an American citizen with a 4-year-old daughter, remembers a conversation with producer Maria Cuomo Cole in which he expressed his outrage at yet another massacre. (“I’m scared of her growing up in this country,” he said.) Then Cole told him she was working on a film about Sandy Hook.  “The floor just fell out from under me,” Eisler recalls. “I didn’t ever want to see that film, much less score it.” But the more he thought about it, the more he felt he needed to contribute something to the public discourse.  “I had this crazy idea,” he says. “It’s a film about community. We’re always talking about the composer community. What if a bunch of us, regardless of what we believe politically, came together to help this other community? What if I became not so much a composer but a curator of the score?” Eisler began calling fellow composers to contribute, or to take his theme and riff on it. “In the end, creatively, it was tough for everybody emotionally. Some people said, ‘I cannot watch this. I’ll give you music and you can use it.’” At the same time, “Newtown” director Kim A. Snyder was thinking about what she calls “emotional mapping. I wanted the film to be emotional and experiential more than facts and figures,” and while she wanted to “create an emotional journey,” she didn’t want music to tip the balance into sentimentality. Eisler persuaded her that a coalition of composers contributing music of various colors and moods might help. “We couldn’t write 17 requiems,” Eisler says. “What if we write music that speaks to the memory of childhood instead of heavily emotional music — because, to be honest, the film can’t stand that. The score has to be humble.” Every composer donated time, fees, rights and royalties to the project, says George S. Clinton (the “Austin Powers” movies). “Rather than dwelling on the grief and the sorrow of the event, the music should be about hope, and be respectful of the ‘moving on’ that the families are doing,” he says. Adds Deborah Lurie (“Safe Haven”): “We all knew that our music needed to use a great deal of restraint, as the film had so much emotion on its own. Also, the film comes across as not having any agenda except to tell the stories of the victims and their families, so the musical tone needed to remain pretty neutral and open for the viewers’ own emotional interpretation. I went with a rather ambient, hypnotic texture, as did many of the other composers.”  “We, as composers, manipulate emotions with music,” notes Christopher Drake (“Yoga Hosers”). “This doesn’t need our help. The real trick was finding how to support these stories, these tragedies, without emphasizing anything — to bear witness to the story.” The other composers included Tyler Bates (“Guardians of the Galaxy”), Jeff Beal (“House of Cards”), Sean Callery (“24”), Miriam Cutler (“The Hunting Ground”), Jeff Danna (“The Good Dinosaur”), Rob Duncan (“Castle”), Christopher Lennertz (“Agent Carter”), Dino Meneghin (“Teen Wolf”), Mikael Sandgren (“Crescent Heights”), Gingger Shankar (“Water & Power”), Rob Simonsen (“Burnt”) and singer-songwriter Mark Renk. At the Dec. 23 session (at Warner Bros., which also donated the use of its scoring stage), Eisler recorded a 30-piece string section in music that ranged from meditative to solemn to hopeful. Director Snyder was moved to tears more than once. Late in the day, Snyder called Mark Barden — the father of a 7-year-old killed at Sandy Hook — and held the phone up so that he could listen as the musicians were playing. “There’s something that feels right about this collective of composers,” she says, “about not one person authoring this.” Adds Blake Neely (“The Flash,” “Supergirl”), whose piece drew applause from the musicians: “I do so much commercial TV, superheroes and bad guys. It’s fun and escapism, we all need it. But sometimes you’ve just got to do something that’s meaningful. As artists we need that. This is something that is very much what we are thinking about. We’re three years past the tragedy, and maybe there’s some stirring of the zeitgeist again.” Fil Eisler (below) recruited the following composers for the “Newtown” score:

118,http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/few-foreign-visitors-to-us-overstay-visa-federal-report-says/2262147,"WASHINGTON — A little more than 1 percent of the nearly 45 million foreign visitors to the United States overstayed their work or tourist visas last year, according to a long-awaited report by the Department of Homeland Security. The report, released late Tuesday, comes as Congress is examining the U.S. visa system after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last month that left 14 people dead and 22 wounded. Tashfeen Malik, one of the attackers, was granted entry to the United States under a K-1 visa, also known as a fiance visa. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a U.S.-born citizen. Both died in a shootout with the police. The attack is believed to have been inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group. Lawmakers fear that terrorists could exploit weaknesses in the visa program, including the program's inability to accurately track people who overstay, to carry out attacks on U.S. soil. The report, which lawmakers have been demanding for nearly 20 years, shows that the number of overstays — about a half million in all — was slightly higher for citizens of countries where a visa is required to visit the United States versus those from countries like France and Germany who are exempt under a visa-waiver program. About 38 countries, mostly in Europe, participate in the visa-waiver program, which allows their citizens to visit without a visa on trips of 90 days or less. Officials acknowledge that the report is imprecise. It covers visitors who arrived in the United States by plane or ship, but not those who entered the country by land. The report, which was mandated by Congress in 1997, is the first to conclusively examine a population that immigration officials know little about. For years, lawmakers have pressed Homeland Security officials for information on those who overstay their visas. In early 2013, Janet Napolitano, then the secretary of Homeland Security, told Congress that the agency planned to issue a report on overstay rates by December 2013. The agency did not follow through. Now that the first report on overstays has been completed, it will be done annually to identify trends, Homeland Security officials said. Many members of Congress and some law enforcement officials worry about misuse of the visa program because the United States does not routinely collect biometric information — fingerprints, iris scans and photographs that can be used for facial recognition — of people leaving the country. Nearly three dozen countries, including many in Europe, Asia and Africa, collect such information.",2016-01-20 21:48:37,"Few foreign visitors to U.S. overstay visa, federal report says",,22,http://www.tampabay.com/
119,https://newrepublic.com/article/128141/bundys-undermining-democracy-oregon,"What’s motivating the armed protesters who occupied Oregon’s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge last week? A local sheriff explained it this way: they came, claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers. In reality, [they] had alternative motives to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States. Ammon Bundy, a leader of the protesters, named their group “Citizens for Constitutional Freedom.” He described their cause this way: The United States Justice Department has no jurisdiction or authority within the state of Oregon, county of Harney over this type of ranch management. These lands are not under U.S. treaties or commerce … and Congress does not have unlimited power. Bundy and his supporters—with guns in tow—want to challenge what they see as government overreach. They believe their method of protest is firmly American and patriotic, reminiscent of armed protests against government tyranny in the Revolutionary War. Some protesters have even donned Colonial garb to underline this point. But as someone who has studied the philosophical foundations of the Second Amendment, I would argue that their actions are detrimental to our democracy. The protesters have been eager to play up the air of civilian rebellion. Bundy spoke of liberating the land for people to use “without fear as free men and women.” Ammon’s brother Ryan called the government’s restrictions on ranchers using federal land “an example of terrorism.” Their firearms are what makes this an occupation and lent it that air of civilian rebellion. The Bundys and their followers are exercising the main purpose of the Second Amendment, according to many in the gun rights movement. Soon after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, when the forces of gun control were mobilizing, Washington Times commentator Andrew Napolitano wrote, “The historical reality of the Second Amendment’s protection of the right to keep and bear arms is not that it protects the right to shoot deer. It protects the right to shoot tyrants, and … to shoot at them effectively.” This notion lends a certain nobility to the gun rights movement. The movement sees itself as standing up for democracy. Widespread civilian gun ownership ensures the integrity of our democracy. It ensures that the people remain sovereign, as our founders intended. The “right to shoot tyrants,” as Napolitano put it, warns our leaders away from the temptation of governing too oppressively. The modern gun rights movement cites English philosopher John Locke as an intellectual inspiration—a fortuitous link, since our Founding Fathers also drew on Locke in composing our founding documents. Guns are deeply inscribed in our nation’s DNA. Gun rights advocates believe Locke is in their corner because he accords citizens a inviolable right of self-defense, which also extends to one’s property. I have argued elsewhere, however, that the modern gun rights movement is too expansive in its conception of self-defense, even applying it to controversial Stand Your Ground laws. Locke is clear that once government is convened by means of a social contract, individuals largely transfer their right of self-defense to the state. This is to avoid self-defense bleeding into vigilantism, and then war. Such a transfer is the very mark of civil society. But gun rights advocates admire Locke because he sanctions the citizens’ right to dissolve government—and to use their guns to do it. Locke expresses a concern that disarming subjects may enable the ruler to “make prey on them when he pleases.” The Oregon protesters would likely say they are doing Locke’s will—they are taking a stand, guns in hand, and will not be pushed around by the government any longer. Locke sees two primary cases where such a rebellion is justified: The Oregon protesters would likely see their protest as fitting Locke’s criteria. Ammon Bundy says the government is not abiding by the laws that the people have approved. His allies also believe the government, in mandating a slew of onerous regulations over federal land management, is denying them their livelihood, threatening their persons and well-being. Of course, people may say that a lot of complaints against the government meet Locke’s conditions. They might—and do—call any number of government actions “tyranny.” Locke would not be surprised. He anticipated that critics would say his “hypothesis lays the ferment for frequent rebellion.” But Locke was not worried. He explained that people will not be quick to rebel over every little complaint, but only for “a long train of abuses.” Why? Because rebellion is no trivial matter; it carries tremendous risks, including the demise of the state and civil society, and a possible return to the anarchy of a state of nature. Locke maintained the right to rebellion is itself “the best fence against rebellion.” Simply knowing that the people retain this right, our elected officials will resist bad behavior. More importantly, Locke said, the people must be careful in how they wield the right to rebel. It is treacherous and foolish for citizens to invoke the threat of rebellion often, or casually, or for minor and isolated complaints. Locke warned those in power have the “temptation of force … and the flattery of those around them.” Threats of rebellion may cause our leaders to worry about their self-preservation and provoke a violent response. These are somber words for gun rights advocates eager to justify the Second Amendment on the basis of supposed government tyranny, especially considering the “temptation of force” in the hands of the U.S. government. Indeed, we have seen the government succumb to this temptation when police forces, whom the Department of Homeland Security has showered with military-grade equipment, deployed equipment to dispel protests in heavy-handed fashion, as in Ferguson, Missouri and Zuccotti Park in Manhattan. Recurring threats of rebellion tell the government that a portion of the electorate is seriously contemplating violence—and it must be prepared to respond in turn. After all, Timothy McVeigh acted on his antigovernment sentiments. Our government cannot afford to take the threats of insurrectionists and antigovernment folk lightly. The gun rights advocates may make their predictions come true. They fret about tyrannical government, but by waving their guns threateningly, by frequently citing the right to rebel, they invite the government to respond with force. The government has been restrained thus far in dealing with Malheur, but as Locke argues, insurrection encourages the government to be oppressive and act outside the law. Martin Luther King Jr. understood democracy far better when, from the Birmingham jail, he wrote, “one who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly,” for in so doing, he expresses “the highest regard for law.” The genius of unarmed protest is that it compels our leaders to behave and respond lawfully.

How should you fight back against people spewing hate speech in your Facebook News Feed? Kill ’em with kindness, of course! That’s according to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who spoke on a panel Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Sandberg talked about how Facebook tries to combat hate speech on its platform, and part of the strategy is encouraging counter-speech, the usually uplifting messages that provide the opposite viewpoints to degrading or negative language online. Sandberg told a specific story about users in Germany who “Liked” a neo-Nazi Facebook page and then flooded it with positive messages. She called the effort a “Like attack.” “The best antidote to bad speech is good speech. The best antidote to hate is tolerance,” she said. “Amplifying … counter-speech to the speech that’s perpetrating hate is, we think, by far the best answer.” The strategy feels pretty “Kumbaya,” but that’s how Facebook has approached the issue of hate speech on its service, specifically when it comes to religious extremism and terrorism. Facebook will take down hate speech when it is flagged by a user, but it doesn’t go looking for it. That means the company is leaning on its user base to create positive content to fight against extremist material. It’s making some effort to prod users in the right direction. Facebook is partnering with the U.S. government to encourage college students to launch anti-terrorism campaigns, for example. It is also partnering with the German government to better locate and remove hateful content. In both cases, Facebook is making financial contributions to the cause. But the company is not using what is perhaps its most valuable asset in this matter: Its News Feed algorithm. Facebook claims that it doesn’t elevate this counter-speech in News Feed; it is instead offering a neutral playing field and hoping that positive speech wins out. Facebook’s role in all of this has been top of mind for U.S. government officials, especially since a mass shooting took place in San Bernardino, Calif., back in December. Sandberg was part of a meeting between top government officials and Silicon Valley bigwigs earlier this month to discuss this very issue. Sandberg hasn’t spoken publicly about those meetings, so Wednesday’s panel was the first we’ve heard from her on this issue. If you want to watch the entire panel you can do so here. Sandberg’s comments on counter-speech start right around the 18:00 minute mark. This article originally appeared on Recode.net. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

Gov. Asa Hutchinson is attending the show this year in a first for an Arkansas governor. ""We have a gun-friendly state that loves the industry, and we love Remington,"" Hutchinson said from the show on a video announcement on social media. Hutchinson said Remington was investing about $12 million in the expansion. He said his administration wants to establish Arkansas as a premier location for investment and expansion for the firearms industry. Hutchinson formerly served as director of the Drug Enforcement Administration and as undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. He also led a National Rifle Association task force that recommended more training for school resource officers and arming selected school personnel after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. Hutchison met with Remington in February 2015, and SIG Sauer was one of six companies the governor contacted on his first day in office, according to a news release. Remington plans to expand its plant in Lonoke and will create 84 new jobs. Remington did not reveal how much it would invest in the project. Remington received $2.5 million from the Governor's Quick Action Closing Fund; eight years in annual cash rebates equal to 3.9 percent of payroll for newly created positions; and a sales- and use-tax credit for businesses that invest $5 million or more in a single location for new construction, expansion or modernization. Madison, N.C.-based Remington began production in Lonoke in 1969 and employs about 1,200. It invested $32 million upgrading the plant in 2013. SIG Sauer will occupy an existing structure in Jacksonville and intends to invest several million dollars in its Arkansas operation. The company makes pistols, rifles, ammunition, optics, silencers, air guns and accessories. Incentives SIG Sauer received include $800,000 from the Governor's Quick Action Closing Fund; a tax credit based on new-job payroll; and sales tax refunds on building materials some machinery and equipment. Based in Newington, N.H., SIG Sauer is part of a worldwide group of firearm-makers including J.P. Sauer and Sohn and Blaser, Gmbh. in Germany and Swiss Arms AG in Switzerland. It employs more than 900. The Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show, commonly called SHOT Show, is an annual, industry-only event. It began Tuesday and runs through today. It's sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association for the firearms, ammunition, shooting and hunting industry. This is the 38th year for the show, and it's expected to have more than 1,600 exhibitors. Attendance last year was nearly 64,000. Gun sales have seesawed in recent years but have boomed over the past few months after a November terrorist attack in Paris killed 130 people and a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., killed 14 in early December. For 2015, the adjusted number of National Instant Criminal Background Checks collected by the National Shooting Sports Foundation was 14.24 million, up 8.7 percent from 13.1 million for 2014. The checks are commonly considered precursors to firearms sales. In 2013, there were 14.8 million checks during the year, the most checks to date for a single year. Gun sales surged in 2013 after gun owners grew concerned about more firearms restrictions after several mass shootings, but sales cooled in 2014, when gun-makers ramped up production and eventual oversupply saturated the market. According to an Arkansas Economic Development Commission recruitment handout, Forbes magazine ranks Arkansas as America's third most gun-friendly state, with 42 registered firearms for every 1,000 residents. It notes that Arkansas has the second-highest percentage of manufacturing employment in the South and the fourth lowest cost of doing business, according to CNBC. The Firearms and Ammunition Industry Economic Impact Report 2014, produced by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, counted 2,650 jobs in Arkansas directly attributed to the firearms industry in 2014, with total wages of $145 million, up from 2,398 jobs in 2013. Fort Smith is home Umarex USA and Walther Arms, both under the umbrella of Arnsberg, Germany-based PW Group. Umarex moved to Fort Smith in 2010, and Walther Arms opened shop in 2012. The companies share space in the Chaffee Crossing development and employ about 90 workers between them. Earlier in the year, Walther Arms released the PPQ .45, its first pistol chambered in Automatic Colt Pistol ammuntion. Right before SHOT Show, Walther debuted the PPS M2, a smaller pistol designed for concealed carry but with additions that many American shooters prefer, such as a button magazine release. At the show itself, Walther unveiled the PPQ Q5 Match Pistol, with upgrades for competition shooting and an optics ready slide. ""These pistols are answers to our customers' demands,"" said Everett Deger, director of marketing for Walther Arms. Walther's sister-company, air gun maker Umarex, also is making a showing at SHOT this year, with 18 new air rifles and pistols and other products including targets. Justin ""J.B."" Biddle, director of marketing for Umarex, said a contingent from the German parent company also will be attending the show. ""We have an exciting year ahead of us,"" Biddle said. In late 2013, Thermold Magazines moved its headquarters to Fort Smith from North Carolina. Sylvan Bednar, president of Thermold, said attending SHOT Show gives the company a chance to touch base with customers and court new ones. He said the company doubled gross sales from 2014 to 2015 and was projecting sales growth of up to 30 percent in 2016. He said international sales and continued sales of magazines to original equipment manufacturers were expected to be key growth areas in 2016. Two custom gun-makers call Berryville home. Wilson Combat has had several expansions recently and employs nearly 150. Nighthawk Custom also is in an expansion period and employs more than 50. Mark Stone, CEO and owner of Nighthawk Custom, said his booth has been busy this year and the demand is clearly up across the board. At this year's show, Nighthawk is presenting its collaboration with Utah-based Browning Arms Co. The pistol is a classic Browning Hi-Power chambered in 9mm and complete with a slew of Nighthawk custom upgrades including parts and improvements made by a gunsmith. Nighthawk touts a philosophy the company calls ""one gun, one gunsmith."" A single gunsmith is responsible for assembling the weapon, and when satisfied with the results, the gunsmith signs the pistol with an individualized stamp. This will hold true with Nighthawk's version of the Browning Hi-Power, Stone said. ""We took this classic pistol and made it better, and it's been a huge hit here,"" he said.

As she spoke, fellow enthusiasts spread out over the 2.25m square feet Sands Expo convention centre at the Venetian casino on Las Vegas’s strip. “We like to go out on range, we like to shoot. It’s a passion of ours.”  Condit and her fiance, Colin Gallagher, a former star of shooting reality TV show Top Shot, already own “around 200” guns, but are looking for the next few pieces to add to their collection. “We have rifles, shotguns, handguns. You name it, we pretty much have it,” said Condit, who runs a Firearms = LOVE Pinterest page. The couple from Wichita, Kansas, are among more than 60,000 people who descended on Sin City this week for Shot Show, which has grown to become the fifth biggest convention held in Las Vegas, according to gun trade association the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF). Steve Sanetti, president of the NSSF, paraphrased Winston Churchill as he opened the show at a gala dinner complete with a standup comedian. “During some pretty dark days of his own: We may experience some setbacks when a frightened and misled public acts without thinking. We may find that our path forward has been temporarily blocked. We may even have to endure some period of darkness before the facts and the truth about lawful, responsible firearms ownership again conquer the powerful forces set against us. The road ahead will be arduous and costly. But the people are never fooled for long. They, and we, will prevail.” Inside the convention centre, uniformed military generals mingled with boy scout leaders touring more than 12 miles of exhibitions showing everything from the latest tactical assault rifles complete with laser guided sights to Lethal Lace, a garter that can double as a holster. As all marketeers know, sex sells – and guns are no different. Manufacturers have hired a string of professional models to pose with their latest guns. Guns.com, the daily guns blog, collated pictures of its favourite women at the show “who do their very best to highlight and promote new products, equipment and, of course, guns”. Attendees who want to see more are invited to “the sexiest ammo show after party” at the Sapphire strip joint down the strip. Free entry with Shot Show pass. Guns are a big business, and the industry is raking in record sales and profits as people rush out to arm themselves following a series of mass shootings and out of fear of increased gun control legislation. The gun rush has lead Wall Street analyst Brian Ruttenbur to call Barack Obama, who earlier this month announced a string of executive actions designed to tighten gun sales laws, “the best salesman for firearms”. FBI background checks, which act as a proxy for gun sales, hit a record 23.1m in 2015 – more than two-and-half times as many as those processed a decade ago. In December alone – the month of the San Bernardino mass shooting in California, which left 14 people dead and 22 seriously injured, more than 3.3m requests were processed through the FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Demand is so unprecedentedly high that Stephen Morris, an FBI assistant director, has warned of a “perfect storm” and cancelled all annual leave for 400 NICS staff in advance of Black Friday, when the system was overwhelmed with a single-day record of 185,345 background check requests. While agents struggle to keep pace with demand, gun manufacturers are celebrating record sales. Smith & Wesson, America’s biggest gun company with a market value of $1.1bn, has raised its sales and profits targets and told investors that some distributors are beginning to run out of some of its most popular guns. Smith & Wesson, which makes 90% of its money selling guns to consumers, expects annual revenues to total $650m to $660m in the year to the end of April, up from the $627m it made the previous year and 57% more than it made in 2012. Smith & Wesson is run by British chief executive James Debney. Shares in the company have more than doubled in the past year, with significant spikes following each mass shooting. Jan Mladek, S&W’s general manager, declined to speak to the Guardian about gun control whilst touting the benefits of the firm’s M&P15 assault-rifle model used to deadly effect in San Bernardino. He later called the show’s organisers to have Guardian reporters escorted from the showgrounds. The US’s other big-listed gun company Sturm, Ruger & Company has seen its shares rise 44% over the past year. Over the same period, the Dow Jones industrial average index of the nation’s biggest stocks has fallen by 10%. The other big US player in guns is Remington Outdoor (formerly Freedom Group), which is owned by billionaire Stephen Feinberg’s private equity group Cerberus Capital Management. Remington, which manufactured the Bushmaster XM15-E2S semiautomatic rifle used in the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, made $939m in guns and ammunition sales in 2014, its latest year available. Cerebus had vowed to sell Freedom after the Sandy Hook tragedy but still owns the company and with it Bushmaster and DPMS/Panther, the biggest players in military-style assault rifles. Jurgen Brauer, an economics professor who specialises in the gun industry, said: “Whenever there is even talk about firearms regulators there is almost immediately an unmistakable increase in sales. Even talk about such legislation translates into sales jumps.” “People are buying guns as part of the American dream of freedom and liberty,” said Brauer, who is based at the Hull College of Business at Augusta University. “And also, the hope and the dream of being able to use guns in self-defence.” People very rarely get to live out that dream, with FBI data showing that gun owners are 78 times more likely to kill themselves than they are to carry out a “justifiable homicide”, which the agency describes as “the killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony, by a private citizen”. As well as gun manufacturers, retailers are also riding a wave. The number of gun-sellers has grown at almost five times as fast as the US population over the past five years, according to an analysis of Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives data. Neil Hogue, owner of the gun-accessories company Hogue Incorporated, said the industry was expecting sales to jump 25-40% this year. “Right now sales are really being driven by fear,” he said as he showed the Guardian around his Shot Show stand. “Fear of not being able to get those particular guns in the future. And fear of not being able to protect your family and protect your home.” The nation’s biggest firearms seller Walmart, which has guns for sale at about half of its 4,500 stores, refuses to provide gun sales data, but Freedom Group told investors that 9% of all its sales are “made to one customer, Walmart.” Ruttenbur reckons Walmart together with Dick’s Sporting Goods and Cabela’s account for 20% of the market. Smaller retailers are happier to speak more freely about their success. Sporting a bright blue mohawk, Thomas Thompson – of Yuma Coin and Gun shop, in Arizona near the border with Mexico – said his gun sales have risen by more than 50% in the past six months. “Because of all the laws they [politicians] are looking to pass we are selling guns quicker than anything,” he said. “Some people are afraid that you’re not going to be able to buy certain guns any more and some are ‘I got to have this’ as everyone is talking about it.” This article was amended on 26 January 2016 to correct the spelling of Wichita.",2016-01-23 07:00:12,"Sex, guns and ammo: inside the world's largest gun industry trade fair",,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

She and her husband, Shawn Otto built the wind-powered, passive solar home. (Pioneer Press: Jean Pieri)  State Auditor Rebecca Otto has kept the lowest profile of any current Minnesota statewide elected official. While she’s accessible to reporters, she hasn’t held a news conference in years. By contrast, most of her recent predecessors used the auditor’s office as a bully pulpit to blast local government officials who wastefully or wrongly spent taxpayer money. Otto, a Democrat in her third four-year term, said in a recent interview that she thought the aggressive, adversarial approach was counterproductive. It antagonized the local officials they oversaw. When she took office in 2007, Otto sought to “rebuild relationships” with city, county, township and school officials to “make sure they were being the best stewards of public funds,” she said. That meant working with them quietly behind the scenes. But in recent months, the public has seen another side of Otto. Last spring and summer, a suddenly feisty auditor repeatedly lambasted Republican lawmakers for pushing through a law that allows counties — the main governmental units her office audits — to outsource financial audits to private firms. In recent weeks, she has waged a social media war against gun-control opponents, firing off dozens of impassioned tweets calling for tighter restrictions on firearms. What sparked her new combativeness? Regarding the cut in her office’s auditing authority, Otto contends GOP lawmakers tried to strip her office of a constitutionally mandated core function. “The public was going to be robbed. I was very upset, so I made a lot of noise,” she said. As for what she called a “spirited debate” on gun control, she said, “I work from my heart” when expressing views on her personal Twitter account. That, she contends, has nothing to do with her official state duties. But Otto seems drawn to the public spotlight. She hinted she might make a bigger splash in the future. “I’m considering running for governor (in 2018),” she said.  Otto will be back in the news later this week. The Office of Legislative Auditor, which monitors state agencies, is expected to release a report ordered by lawmakers to assess the efficiency of Otto’s office. The state auditor’s main job is to oversee the roughly $20 billion a year raised and spent by more than 4,000 cities, counties, townships, school districts and other local government entities, as well as hundreds of public pension funds. For years, Minnesota county officials have been asking lawmakers for authority to hire private accounting firms, instead of the state auditor, to review their finances, contending it would reduce costs. The state auditor charges counties for its services. Private accounting companies could charge less for financial reviews, but state officials say Otto’s auditors are more familiar with state laws and counties’ financial records and likely to conduct more thorough reviews. Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said lawmakers don’t know if private audits would cost less, so he and House Speaker Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, agreed to direct Legislative Auditor James Nobles to study the issue. “We didn’t agree to take away her (Otto’s) authority,” Bakk said. House Republicans demanded that change, inserting the “privatization” provision into a state government finance bill on the final night of the regular legislative session in May. During subsequent negotiations, Dayton and DFL senators resisted, but GOP lawmakers prevailed, and it became law. An outraged Otto harshly and repeatedly criticized Republicans. One evening as the bill’s negotiators were meeting, Rep. Jim Nash, R-Waconia, said he greeted Otto in the State Office Building lobby. “Without missing a beat, the state auditor launches into a very combative tirade against me, saying ‘You Republicans are gutting my office! I can’t believe you’re doing this to my office!’ ” Nash said. Asked about the confrontation, Otto said, “I’m very direct when it comes to a matter as important as an attempt to gut the core function of a constitutional office.” The GOP move was “purely political,” Otto said. Republicans “love privatization,” and she believes they were out to get her. Nonsense, responded GOP Rep. Sarah Anderson, chair of the State Government Finance Committee. A DFL-led Senate passed the bill, and a DFL governor signed it. “You can’t get more bipartisan than that,” she said. House Republicans inserted the provision because county officials requested it, Anderson said. Under current law, cities, school districts, townships and 26 counties can already hire private auditing firms, and the new law puts the remaining counties “on the same playing field.” She thinks it will save taxpayers money in the long run. Dayton said he assumed he could get GOP lawmakers to drop it, “but I underestimated the obstinance of the Republicans. It was like a feather in their cap. It was one of the ways they were going to show their base that they shrunk government.” The battle isn’t over. The new law doesn’t take effect until Aug. 1, and Otto has retained legal counsel to possibly challenge its constitutionality.  After the San Bernardino mass shooting in early December, Otto took to her Twitter account, @Rebecca_Otto. “Enough already!’ Otto posted. “America, you have been used by the gun industry. Time to push back and say no more of this #gunsanity.” This wasn’t just a one-off statement. It was among the first of more than 100 tweets about guns Otto posted over the next several days. And even after that initial burst died down, Otto has returned to the subject on several occasions over the past two months. The tweets drew plenty of pushback from gun rights activists, who called her positions “disgusting” in Twitter replies. Others asked what Otto’s preferred gun policy would look like — and got frustrated when she repeated, over and over again, that “what we are doing is not working” in response, along with a call to lift a ban on gun studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bryan Strawser is among gun rights activists who have debated Otto on social media. She’s one of several politicians he’s clashed with on Twitter, and he said he didn’t come away impressed. “She was tweeting repeatedly about the issue with some very strong opinions but wasn’t providing any specifics in terms of solutions,” said Strawser, executive director of the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus and PAC. One surprise he had: despite their aggressive debates, Otto hasn’t blocked Strawser from interacting with her on Twitter. The block button is a tool Otto has used more than once — including on some state lawmakers. “Why are some Twitter trolls surprised when they are blocked?” Otto said on the site. Trolling is a term for people who are deliberately provocative. “You troll, you go.”  While Otto, 52, has risen to the top ranks of Minnesota politicians, her career arc was unexpected. She is a California native who “fell in love with Minnesota” at an early age. Born in San Diego, she grew up in Evanston, Ill. At age 14, she took a canoe trip in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota, starting a love affair with the region’s lakes, forests and streams that continues today. She enrolled in Macalester College, where she majored in biology, in part to be closer to the BWCA. After graduating, she stayed in St. Paul and met her husband, author and screen writer Shawn Otto. They started a painting, decorating and historic home renovation business. She left the business after several years to earn a master’s degree in education at the University of Minnesota and became a seventh-grade life science teacher. In 1994, the couple purchased a wooded, rolling 30-acre property in Marine on St. Croix and built a renewable energy home. A wind turbine and solar panels provide most of the energy for the super-insulated house, which also has a geothermal heating system. Otto is passionate about the environment, but she stresses the house has been a good investment that “saved a lot of money” — a subject she’s equally passionate about. As a child, she spent a lot of time with a grandmother who kept track of every cent she spent in a ledger. “My grandma gave me the grounding of being really careful with money, watching every penny, and conservation and not wasting,” Otto said. She quit teaching in 1995 to stay home with their son, Jacob, now a student at Hamline University. When he started elementary school in Forest Lake, she joined the school’s Parent Teacher Organization and soon was appointed to a school district finance committee. Otto got involved in politics by running for the Forest Lake school board while simultaneously leading a campaign to pass a property tax levy referendum for the district. She won, and the levy referendum passed. In 2002, a DFL legislative leader recruited Otto to run for a House seat. “I said of course not,” she recalled, explaining she thought there was “some dirtiness and ‘ickiness’ in politics.” But when she told her husband and son her decision, they argued that she could help improve education for all Minnesota children if elected. She ran and lost to veteran Republican Rep. Mark Holsten of Stillwater. Three months later, after Holsten was appointed deputy commissioner for the Department of Natural Resources, she ran in a special election for his vacant seat and defeated Republican Matt Dean of Dellwood. In 2004 she lost her bid for re-election to Dean and declared she was “done with politics.” But when former Republican Governor and State Auditor Arne Carlson and two other former state auditors — DFL Gov. Mark Dayton and Republican-turned-Democrat Judi Dutcher — urged her to run for auditor in 2006, she launched a campaign and defeated GOP incumbent Pat Anderson. Otto was re-elected in a 2010 rematch with Anderson and easily won a third term in 2014.  As auditor, Otto said she has worked with local government officials to improve their financial record-keeping and prevent mistakes. “We’re proactive, not reactive,” she said. “It’s paid great dividends.” Otto and her staff received high marks in a spot check of local officials by the Pioneer Press. City administrators praised her office for developing software to help small towns keep required financial records and for helping larger cities navigate complex tax increment financing regulations and meet pension obligations without increasing property taxes. The auditor’s office oversees more than 700 volunteer firefighter pension plans, and the head of the association that represents the plans credits Otto for helping them update antiquated pension laws. County auditors contacted by the Pioneer Press said they will continue to have the state auditor’s office review their books because they are more thorough and experienced, but they also applauded the new law for giving them the option to hire a private firm. While Otto wins praise for her work, she also has critics. Although he encouraged her run in 2006, Carlson said, “As an auditor she has been a terrible disappointment.” She has not been an aggressive watchdog, he asserted, faulting her in particular for failing to thoroughly investigate the City of Minneapolis for possibly circumventing laws to finance the new Vikings stadium. So Carlson isn’t surprised the Legislature took away some of her powers. “But I think it was a very unwise move,” he said. “I personally think it’s unconstitutional.” Dayton defended Otto, calling her a very capable, hard-working auditor. “County auditors are not shy about expressing their displeasure, so I’d say the lack of any criticism is very positive.” Regarding her future, Otto said many supporters have urged her to run for governor after Dayton steps down. As auditor, she said, she understands a broad range of state issues. She plans to evaluate whether she has the “right skill set” to get things done as the state’s chief executive and whether she could win. “But there’s a long line” of other potential candidates, she noted.

Police said the male suspect can't be named under Canada's Youth Criminal Justice Act. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Supt. Grant St. Germaine said nine people were shot in the school, including a female teacher's aide who died at the scene and a male teacher who died in a hospital. He said seven people wounded in Friday's shooting at the school are hospitalized. Two brothers, 17-year-old Dayne Fountaine and 13-year-old Drayden, were shot and killed in a home before the gunman headed to the grade 7-12 La Loche Community School, police said. Police responded to a call of shots fired at the school shortly after the lunch hour. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commanding Officer Brenda Butterworth-Carr said when officers arrived at the school they saw the front door had been shot open. They entered the school, spotted the suspect and gave chase before apprehending him. He is due in court next week. Police said Saturday that they were not aware of a motive and declined to say what type of gun was used. The school is in the remote Dene aboriginal community of La Loche in Saskatchewan Province. La Loche is a community of less than 3,000 where just about everybody knows everybody else. ""This is a significant event for Canada,"" St. Germaine said. ""It's a huge impact on the community of La Loche. It's a part of changing times. We are seeing more violence."" Residents lighted candles and placed flowers at a makeshift memorial outside the school. Shootings at schools or on university campuses are rare in Canada. However, the country's bloodiest mass shooting occurred on Dec. 6, 1989, at Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique, when Marc Lepine entered a college classroom at the engineering school, separated the men from the women, told the men to leave and opened fire, killing 14 women before killing himself. The educational assistant killed at the Saskatchewan school was identified as 21-year-old Marie Janvier. Deegan Park, her boyfriend of three years, said he would have given up the rest of his life just to spend another year with her. ""I grew up not a good guy, but she turned me right,"" Park told The Associated Press. ""She was that much of a great person to turn me right from all the wrongdoings I used to do. ... She was a fantastic person."" ""I loved her, I really did,"" said Park, who remembered her smile and how she would blush when she was happy. Kevin Janvier said his daughter was an only child. ""I'm just so sad,"" he said. Ashton Lemaigre, a teacher at the school and friend of Marie Janvier, said she worked as a teacher's aide in his classroom. He said she was kind and patient with children and planned to get her teaching degree someday. ""The kids loved having her around,"" Lemaigre said. ""They would just come running to her. And she was just a friend to everybody."" A second victim was identified as 35-year-old Adam Wood, a new teacher at the school. His family in Ontario issued a statement describing him as an adventurer with a passion for life who made people laugh until their stomachs hurt. ""Adam had just begun his teaching career in La Loche last September and was enjoying his time,"" his family said. ""He was always up for a good challenge and lived each day joyously."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, called it ""every parent's worst nightmare."" A student who was just returning from lunch when the shots were fired Friday said his friends ran past him urging him to get out. ""'Run, bro, run!"" Noel Desjarlais-Thomas, 16, recalled his friends saying to him as they fled La Loche's junior and senior high school. ""There's a shotgun! There's a shotgun! They were just yelling to me. And then I was hearing those shots too, so of course I started running."" The RCMP said the first reports of shots being fired at the school came in around 1 p.m. Friday, and parents and residents were warned to stay away. Witnesses said some students hid in gym dressing rooms for hours. A nearby elementary school was also placed on lockdown as a precaution. Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said he is in a state of disbelief. He planned to visit La Loche on Sunday and promised to provide crisis support and counseling services. La Loche, like a number of aboriginal communities in Canada's prairie provinces, has been plagued by high suicide rates and poverty. Wall added that U.S. Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman had offered the counsel of U.S. communities that have experienced school shootings. ""He noted that quite tragically the United States has more experience with the likes of what we saw in La Loche,"" Wall said.

Bobby Cameron, Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, said the shooting Friday was the worst tragedy to ever hit the community of 3,000. The Dene are an aboriginal group who inhabit the northern parts of Canada. “It’s not something you ever imagine happening here. The whole community, province and country has been affected and we will all go into mourning,” said Cameron, who attended the La Loche school’s graduation ceremony for the past few years. “Right now we’re just in a state of shock and disbelief.” U.S. Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman offered his condolences and noted the problem of school shootings in America. “We have experienced similar tragedies far too often in the United States and understand all too well the heartache and sadness that result,” Heyman said.

135,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/jan/24/after-26-years-89-nightmare-persists-20/,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Tammy Thomson switched off the lights and crowded the children into the corner of the classroom. She tried not to think about her father or about the morning 26 years ago. She focused instead on her students and the lockdown drill, a testament to a new American reality. But old questions lurked in her thoughts: Had her father felt fear like this? She whispered to the kids that everything would be OK. Later, at home that night she canceled dinner plans, told her children she wasn't well and went to her bedroom. She wept as she recalled the morning in 1989 when she, her mother, sister and brothers became early members of a grim and growing fraternity: families upended by mass, public, inexplicable murder. Did her father have time to feel pain? Regret? ""It's like someone is reaching into you and tearing your heart apart all over again,"" Thomson said. ""I feel very exposed, like I want to hide. I withdraw. It's hard for me to be around people. I can't laugh. It's been 26 years. When is this going to stop?"" Her father, Lloyd White, was a victim of one of the nation's first workplace rampages. On Sept. 14, 1989, Joseph Wesbecker, a disgruntled worker who was angry and mentally ill, stormed the Standard Gravure printing plant with an AK-47 and killed her father and seven other people before turning the gun on himself. After that shooting, the TV cameras eventually packed up, and the day was filed away to history -- for all but the families of the dead, the 12 who were injured but survived, and dozens who hid in closets and cubicles and had to step over their friends, dead and dying, to escape. Wesbecker robbed them of loved ones. He took the ability to walk, to laugh, to enter crowded rooms, to live without wondering what more they should have done that day and all the days after. The mass shooting seemed unthinkable 26 years ago. But since then, the survivors and their families have watched it become fairly common. ""I feel like I'm gonna throw up each time,"" said Thomson's mother, Maryla White. ""Because I know what these people are going to go through. And it's not just that day. It's not just the wife or the husband or the kids. It's the whole family, their whole community. And it lasts forever and ever. It never stops."" ""I had time to pray"" On Dec. 3, JoAnne Self jerked awake. She had been dreaming about running through a tunnel alone, away from gun blasts and blood. The day before, 2,000 miles away in San Bernardino, Calif., Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook stormed into an office party, opened fire with assault rifles and killed 14 people. ""I know it's been 26 years,"" Self said. ""But I cry whenever I see one of these on TV."" Self, a payroll administrator at Standard Gravure, was in her office on the third floor on that September morning when she heard what sounded like bulbs popping. She walked into the hallway and saw the gunman firing quickly, deliberately. Wesbecker, a 47-year-old pressman with a long history of paranoia and manic depression, had been placed on permanent disability leave. Seething with resentment toward the company, he went to the third-floor offices looking for executives but found none. Instead, he fired indiscriminately. His first victims were two receptionists, 49-year-old Sharon Needy and Angela Bowman, who had just returned to work from maternity leave. Self ran. She had to step over Needy's body to escape, though she doesn't remember it. For years, she braced for that recollection to return. It never did. ""I had time to get out of here. I had time to pray,"" she says. ""Some of those people never even had time to pray."" Helpless moment Pat Quinkert found himself safely outside on the street shortly after the first gun blasts, running up and down the block looking for the employees he supervised. Minutes before, he had walked into his office to begin an ordinary day as the maintenance superintendent. A machinist named Paul Sallee stopped him. Sallee was beaming. His daughter had had twins. He asked for Christmas week off to go see them in Hawaii. Quinkert took the timecards upstairs. That's when he heard the pops. He thought the air conditioner was finally breaking to pieces. The next few minutes became a blur. Someone ushered him outside. There he learned that someone had opened fire inside the plant and that Sallee had been shot. He had been in the Air Force during World War II, and had been sent to rescue survivors of downed planes. His impulse was to run back into Standard Gravure to see if he could help. ""I could have tried,"" he said. But a police officer held him back. Sallee died in the basement from a gunshot wound in his chest. Quinkert didn't sleep well after that, said his wife, Clara. He didn't eat well. He sometimes woke up screaming. He loved his job, his employees, the hum of the churning presses. But he called the Social Security Administration and asked about when he could retire. He's 90 years old now. He's forgotten some things, but not that helpless moment on the sidewalk. ""Sometimes,"" he said, ""I want to rub it out of my mind."" ""Nobody seems to care"" Mike Campbell happily pulls up the sleeves of his shirts and the legs of his pants to show the scars left when six bullets ripped through his flesh. He talked and talked and talked about it: on talk shows, to reporters, to Congress. He thought the world should know what a weapon of war had done to him. ""Why don't people understand that it's going to get worse if we don't do something about it?"" he has said, again and again, for 26 years. Campbell, then a 51-year-old pressman, had sat down in the break room that morning with a cup of coffee and the newspaper. He heard a commotion but thought nothing of it. The pressroom was always thundering with men shouting and machines banging. Then the door swung open, and a man stood there with an AK-47. Pop, pop, pop. Pop, pop, pop. The gunman circled the room, shooting each man. Bullets ripped into Campbell's arm and leg, and he fell forward onto the table. He turned his head away from the gunman and tried to be still and silent. He wanted Wesbecker to think he was dead. Pop, pop, pop. Pop, pop, pop. More bullets burned into Campbell's arms and legs. Then Wesbecker walked out. Campbell tried to get up, but fell to the floor into a flood of blood and water. The bullets had shredded the water pipes. A man who had been sitting to Campbell's right was dead. So was the man to his left. Using one arm and one leg, he was eventually able to crawl out of the room. He had surgeries for weeks, sat in a wheelchair for months and walked with a limp for 15 years. He could never work again. He thought he could use the tragedy all for good. He kept busy, and the nightmares that haunted his friends never came for him. He worked with gun-control advocates to push for background checks and a ban on assault weapons. But, he watches year after year as the ranks of people like him -- gunned down in mass shootings -- grow larger. ""Nobody seems to care about it,"" he said. ""And it's just going to go on and on and on. And now I'm oblivious to it. ... I just can't think about it anymore. The anger wells up."" He woke up one night 20 years after the shooting and saw a man in the corner. The man, faceless under a black robe and hood, returned night after night. Campbell at first blamed the sighting on cataracts. But a doctor fixed his eyes, and the figure stalks him still. Now 77, he believes the trauma finally caught up with him. He jumps awake at ordinary sounds -- the hot tub humming on the back porch, the ice maker clunking out cubes. ""I really don't know what to do about it,"" he said. ""I know it's not there. I know it's not a part of my life. There's no boogeyman. But I swear I saw it last night."" A gun and tears John Barger carries his gun with him always -- at work, at the store, at the movies. When his children go out for milk, he hugs them and tells them he loves them, just in case. He has trained them for the worst-case scenario: Know your exits; if you hear popping, start running and don't stop until you make it outside. He owns an assault rifle. ""Safety is an illusion,"" he said. He was 18 years old, in his first semester of college, when his mother got him out of bed and asked him to go check on his father. There'd been some kind of shooting at the plant. Richard Barger never saw it coming, his son believes. He felt no pain and died before his body tumbled down the stairs. Wesbecker realized at that point whom he had killed, witnesses told police. Barger was his friend. They played golf together. Wesbecker bent over his body and said he was sorry. Richard Barger lay on his back on a conveyor belt for hours, his arms splayed, blood pooling around him. A photographer from the Louisville Courier-Journal snapped his photo, and it ran on the front page the next day. John Barger's mother picked up the newspaper on the porch, fell to her knees and wailed. She cried and cried, until Barger thought she would die from exhaustion. Barger never blamed the gun. His best memories of him with his father were of them hunting together. But he never hunted again. He didn't want to kill anymore. He trapped spiders in jars and released them instead of swatting them. He dodged frogs on the highway. He quit college to stay with his mother. Sometimes he would wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of her crying and he'd go hold her. Years passed. ""When it first happens, you don't see no light in the tunnel,"" he said. ""I can remember that ache. Then one day the ache is gone. It seems like you remember your whole world came down around you. And the next thing you know, the whole world's still moving. And I guess I've got to get up and go too."" Running from pain When they told Maryla White that her husband had been killed in a massacre, she'd laughed and said it wasn't true. She'd said he always went to the Bargain Mart on Thursdays, and he'd be home any minute. Then she went to the window to wait for him. She remembers so little of the following years that she's considered undergoing hypnosis to bring it all back. She recalls feeling trapped. She couldn't focus or get her mind to work. She had married her high school sweetheart on her 18th birthday, and suddenly she was a 40-year-old single mother of four who had never written a check or paid a bill. ""I would go to church, and I would sit by myself and I couldn't pray,"" she said. ""I would go and just sit."" The family never talked about the shooting. ""I thought if we didn't talk about it, everything would be OK,"" she said. ""And it wasn't."" Her youngest son, Chet, then 14, started drinking. He would arrive home drunk and flop down on her bed. ""Why, Mom, why?"" he would sob. Chet White, now a photographer and a father of two, grew out of his drinking. For decades, he felt guilty for having any happiness or laughter in his life. ""How can you be happy after our dad went through that?"" But now, he's starting to look hard at his father's death and how he has carried it with him. He's resolved to confront it all and move forward. And one day, his mother -- a tiny woman with a blond bob hairstyle -- decided she couldn't just cry anymore. Her boys had been cross-country champions, and her husband never missed their meets. So that day she went out to the sidewalk and started running. She pounded out a little fear, a little fury with each stride. She ran until her legs collapsed. She felt, for the first time in years, a little hope. She got up the next morning and did it again. She ran and ran and ran, 20 mini-marathons in all. ""I didn't look back,"" she said. ""I just kept going.""

136,http://www.tampabay.com/news/world/police-charge-17-year-old-in-canada-after-4-shot-dead/2262562,"TORONTO — Police on Saturday charged a 17-year-old boy with four counts of first-degree murder and seven counts of attempted murder in a mass shooting at a school and home in a remote aboriginal community in western Canada, officials said. Police said the male suspect can't be named under Canada's Youth Criminal Justice Act. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent Grant St. Germaine said nine people were shot at La Loche Community School, including Marie Janvier, 21, a teacher's aide who died at the scene, and Adam Wood, 35, a new teacher who died in a hospital. He said seven people wounded in Friday's shooting at the school are hospitalized. Police said two brothers, 17-year-old Dayne Fountaine and 13-year-old Drayden, were shot dead in a home before the gunman headed to the school, which has students in grades seven through 12. Police responded to a call of shots fired at the school shortly after the lunch hour. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commanding Officer Brenda Butterworth-Carr said when officers arrived at the school they saw the front door had been shot open. They entered the school, spotted the suspect and gave chase before apprehending him. He is due in court this week. Police said they were not aware of a motive and declined to say what type of gun was used. The school is in the remote Dene aboriginal community of La Loche in Saskatchewan province. La Loche is a community of fewer than 3,000 where just about everybody knows everybody else. ""This is a significant event for Canada,"" St. Germaine said. ""It's a huge impact on the community of La Loche. It's a part of changing times. We are seeing more violence."" Residents lit candles and placed flowers at a memorial outside the school. Shootings at schools or on university campuses are rare in Canada. However, the country's bloodiest mass shooting occurred on Dec. 6, 1989, at Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique, when Marc Lepine entered a college classroom at the engineering school, separated the men from the women, told the men to leave and opened fire, killing 14 women before killing himself.",2016-01-23 20:54:47,Police charge 17-year old in Canada after 4 shot dead,,22,http://www.tampabay.com/

It’s a topic that is (or at least should be) causing sleepless nights, no less so for the artists among us. With Dark Night, director Tim Sutton takes a pointillist, associative approach to understanding this crisis that mixes mock-documentary with elegantly framed tableaux of ex-urban 21st century Americana. Its homonymous title, evocative of the 2012 mass shooting at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, is the only brash (some might even say bratty) aspect of this otherwise cold, distant film. The noble intention to make us dwell on our culture, and perhaps shame its more voyeuristic members, quickly devolves into a cavalcade of tedium. Perhaps it’s the very seriousness of the subject matter that makes a derisive “makes ya think, huh?” the most fitting response to this very long 85-minute picture.  Each vignette is gorgeously shot (hats off to cinematographer Helene Louvart) and could easily be snipped from the larger work and projected on a gallery wall. Herein lies the problem with Dark Night. Sutton’s approach is so detached, so much a visitation from outer space, that the characters are nothing but a blur, undercutting any essence of dread. As the film clomps on, we’re left wondering which of these characters is going to crack first and start killing the others, mostly so we’ll know this failed experiment of a movie has ended. Which isn’t to say there aren’t a few moments that have a spark of life. A group session of veterans discussing PTSD is touching, as is the amusing phone call a thirsty, selfie-happy actress makes on her own behalf as her “agent”. The camerawork throughout is quite extraordinary and, frankly, trying to divine why the dolly shot in the JCPenny parking lot continues, even though the actress ducks out of frame, ends up being more interesting than the vain hope of getting to know any of the characters. Radio and TV chatter about gun violence wafts in as white noise, including an image of the Dark Knight gunman James Holmes. One of the many creepy, quiet and armed men stakes out a movie theater which, we’ll see, is showing a movie called Dark Night. There’s even a Batman mask tossed in with all the teen detritus like skateboards and vape pens. I guess somewhere out there some people will think that’s clever. In 2013, a film called Blue Caprice, a hazily shot look at the 2002 Beltway Sniper shootings, played Sundance. It ruffled some feathers and some found it too mannered, but it told its story in a unique, provocative way. Dark Night wants to provoke, but like the confused young killers it aims to portray, its statement is more juvenile than profound.",2016-01-25 05:17:36,The Dark Night review – the view on America's gun crisis from outer space,"motion pictures,reviews",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
140,http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2016/01/jersey_city_school_board_wont.html,"school board.jpg Jersey City school board member John Reichart, a retired cop, asked board members this week if he could bring his concealed weapon to board meetings. Terrence T. McDonald | The Jersey Journal (Jersey Journal file photo) The Jersey City school board has given a thumbs down to its newest member's request to carry his gun to board meetings. John Reichart, as a retired NJ Transit cop, is allowed by federal law to carry a concealed weapon anywhere in the United States. But state law requires him to obtain approval to carry his gun inside schools -- the board generally meets at School 11 -- and at a caucus last week, his fellow board members expressed opposition. Reichart, who works for local developers Paul and Eric Silverman, told The Jersey Journal he's been carrying a gun since he was 19 years old. At the caucus, Reichart told board members that a ""good guy with a gun"" could stop a mass shooting, but his colleagues were not convinced. Lorenzo Richardson said the district has security guards and ""we trust them."" Reichart said he thought not allowing him to carry his gun to board meetings was a ""short-sighted decision."" Reichart, who retired from NJ Transit in 2010, was first elected to the nine-member school board in November, and was seated earlier this month. At his first board meeting, he was elected its vice president. ""I'm thankful for the thoughtful and respectful manner in which my fellow board members deliberated and respect their decision,"" he said. The City Council has two retired police officers. One, Ward C Councilman Rich Boggiano, said he occasionally carries a weapon when he's in City Hall. Boggiano called the board's decision ""the dumbest thing I ever heard."" Alexander P. Roubian, president of the New Jersey Second Amendment Society, said ""Aafew hoplophobes on the school board endanger everyone else because of their irrational fears and feelings,"" Roubian said.

144,http://www.ocregister.com/articles/say-701336-didn-shooting.html,"Trending: WASHINGTON — A homemade bomb left behind by the husband and wife who perpetrated a mass shooting at a California social services center failed to detonate because it was poorly constructed, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. The failure compelled Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 29, to drive around the area of San Bernardino after the shootings that killed 14 people. They were apparently trying to set off the remote-controlled bomb, one of the officials said. The officials were briefed on the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the case publicly. Investigators believe the couple intended to detonate the improvised explosive device — placed in a bag left at the center that morning by Farook before the shooting — to kill emergency responders or possibly before their attack. The plan to set off an explosive device as part of a wave of attacks is similar to an aborted 2012 plan by Farook and his longtime friend Enrique Marquez, who has been charged for his role in aiding the violence. The pair planned to explode pipe bombs on a freeway and then shoot emergency responders. The device found at the scene in San Bernardino consisted of three pipe bombs, constructed with Christmas tree lights and attached to a remote-control toy car switched to “on.” The couple had the remote with them in their rented SUV. It was found after the shootout. The FBI is still trying to determine where the couple was or what they did during 18 minutes between the Dec. 2 attack and a shootout with authorities that left them dead. Investigators have no details on the couple’s whereabouts between 12:59 p.m. and 1:17 p.m. that day and worry that they may have met with someone, dropped by a storage unit or visited a residence. Authorities accounted for the couple’s movements using traffic and surveillance cameras, witness accounts and other techniques. While driving around San Bernardino and Redlands afterward, the couple appeared to drive aimlessly and stopped multiple times over a roughly 20-mile area, according to the FBI. They never strayed far from the location of their initial attack, and at one point appeared to be trying to drive closer. Farook and Malik also stopped by a nearby lake, which a dive team searched unsuccessfully for days, trying to find any abandoned electronic devices. Detectives watching the area saw the couple driving toward their home in the SUV, and Farook and Malik died in a shootout with authorities. One of the officials said the hard drive has still not been found, and the two cellphones, which were sent to the FBI lab, were so badly crushed that investigators have not yet been able to conduct a forensic examination on them. One rifle used in the attack was modified in what appears to be an effort to make the gun fully automatic. But despite the installation of the required parts, the machining wasn’t done properly and so the effort was unsuccessful, one official said. The errors constructing the explosive device and modifying the gun may indicate that the two killers were self-taught, but without potential electronic evidence on the couple’s computer hard drive and phones, it is hard to know for sure, officials said. The FBI has said there’s no evidence that the attack was directed from overseas. Get the latest news delivered daily!

148,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/hottopics/~3/5BTlNcO2llU/ct-milwaukee-temple-attack-20160126-story.html,"MILWAUKEE — Samy Mohamed Hamzeh, 23, had a plan, the Justice Department said: Kill more than two dozen people at a Masonic temple in Milwaukee and become an international jihadist superstar. ""I am telling you, if this hit is executed, it will be known all over the world,"" Hamzeh told two unnamed FBI sources in Arabic. ""All over the world, all the mujahedeen will be talking and they will be proud of us. ... We are marching at the front of the war."" The larger the number of victims, the better, Hamzeh said. But 30 sounded about right. ""Thirty is excellent,"" he allegedly said. ""If I got out, after killing 30 people, I will be happy 100 percent ... 100 percent happy, because these 30 will terrify the world."" Now, Hamzeh's alleged plans have been derailed. He was arrested Tuesday and charged with possessing machine guns and a silencer, as the DOJ announced. ""Samy Mohamed Hamzeh devised a detailed plan to commit a mass shooting intended to kill dozens of people,"" Acting United States Attorney Gregory J. Haanstad said in a statement. ""He also said that he wanted this mass shooting to be 'known the world over' and to 'ignite' broader clashes. It is difficult to calculate the injury and loss of life that was prevented by concerned citizens coming forward and by the tireless efforts of the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force."" Arrested after reportedly purchasing weapons from two undercover FBI agents, Hamzeh's plans were detailed indeed, prosecutors said. Though he originally intended to attack Israeli soldiers and civilians in the West Bank, he settled on the Freemasons' lodge, and discussed the need for high-powered weaponry at length. ""We want two machine guns,"" Hamzeh, who was placed under surveillance in October, told the FBI's sources. ""You now have one, so we want two more, and we need three silencers, that's it. Find out how much all together these will cost, and then we will march."" According to the DOJ, he had plotted the whole attack out, down to where he thought his conspirators would stand at the temple. ""One of us will stay at the door at the entrance and lock the door down, he will be at the main door down, two will get to the lift up, they will enter the room, and spray everyone in the room,"" he allegedly said. ""The one who is standing downstairs will spray anyone he finds. We will shoot them, kill them and get out."" Hamzeh also allegedly had an escape plan. ""We will walk and walk, after a while, we will be covered as if it is cold, and we'll take the covers off and dump them in a corner and keep on walking, as if nothing happened, as if everything is normal,"" he said, according to prosecutors. ""But one has to stand on the door, because if no one stood at the door, people will be going in and out, if people came in from outside and found out what is going on, everything is busted."" Though a Freemasons' lodge was targeted in Istanbul in 2004, Hamzeh's purported choice of target appeared to be novel. Freemasons, or Masons, have been in America since before the founding of the United States. There were an estimated 1.5 million Masons in the country in 2009; Wisconsin now has 11,000, according to the Associated Press. George Washington was a Mason; so were both Presidents Roosevelt and John Wayne. Masonic symbols appear on our currency, and they influenced the design of Washington, D.C. Many conspiracies have been attributed to the group's allegedly insidious aims, and entire political parties have been devoted to reducing their influence in politics. ""The Freemasons were the first, the biggest, and the best-known gentlemen's organization in the world,"" Christopher Hodapp wrote in ""Freemasons for Dummies."" ""Up until about 1960, if you weren't a Mason, you at least knew what one was. As secret societies go, they were a pretty badly hidden one."" Hamzeh allegedly took the view that Masons, though now known primarily for their charity work, deserved to die. The DOJ said he toured the lodge in Milwaukee with the two people he thought were his co-conspirators. ""They are all Masonic; they are playing with the world like a game, man, and we are like asses, we don't know what is going on,"" Hamzeh allegedly said.

""I can understand from that standpoint where someone who is against this country would target us.""

Just as Seattle mayor Ed Murray was concluding a speech Tuesday night on the burgeoning problem of homelessness in Seattle, news broke that two homeless people in ""The Jungle"" had been shot and killed in what police describe as a ""very targeted"" shooting.  After Seattle mayor delivers speech on homelessness, he's told of shooting with multiple victims at a homeless camp: https://t.co/5tLmHLU6UM — KING 5 News (@KING5Seattle) January 27, 2016 Three other people, two of whom were women, were injured in the shooting. The suspects remain at large. Eyewitness heard multiple shots from a homeless encampment i've seen at least 5 victims, so far #BreakingNews pic.twitter.com/M50WbyN7Rb — Gary Horcher (@GaryKIRO7) January 27, 2016 For over 20 years, The Jungle, a tent city in a wooded area in the city, has served as a sort-of city-within-a-city of homeless people in Seattle. Residents there range from down-on-their-luck vagrants to lifetime drug addicts and everything in between. Depending on who you ask, The Jungle is either a godsend for an already vulnerable population or a menace that needs to be dealt with immediately if not sooner. Homeless advocate Craig Thompson takes the view that the residents there are vulnerable to victimization - from the police, each other, and outside criminals. ""The Jungle is not a homeless camp. The woods have historically contained camps of people.... When cleanups, sweeps or whatever you want to call them have been suspended, people living in the woods have been victimized by violent criminals. Sometimes, those criminals have been other homeless people; sometimes by those in the narcotics trade."" Neighbor Nicole Brodeur, however, views The Jungle, and other homeless encampments, as blights upon the community. ""You don't want to go down there,"" Nicole Brodeur wrote in the Seattle Times in 2007. ""Not even in broad daylight, and certainly not alone.... Homeless encampments are a health hazard, not only for those who live in them, but for neighbors concerned with their safety, and the rats and campfires that threaten their homes."" Neighbor Angie Gerrald, similarly, is tired of illegally-parked RV's, blatant drug deals, and piles of used needles. And worst of all, she's tired of the police looking the other way at the problem. ""The blatant lawlessness has been a whole new era. There is so little response — so little they [police] can and will do about it."" In fact, some Seattle residents are so fed up with homelessness, property crimes, and drug crimes taking place in and around their neighborhoods, as well as police inaction, that they have taken to hiring private security companies and off-duty cops to patrol their neighborhoods, according to the Seattle Times. Neighbor Brad Renton doesn't fault the Seattle police, but he says the city's crime problem has gotten too out of hand. ""SPD is a wonderful group of guys. They're just getting overwhelmed. You'd like them to be there for you, and they are there, but they have to be there for the important stuff [instead of property and drug crimes]."" Inside The Jungle and outside of it, the homeless population in Seattle has exploded in recent years. In the mid-2000s, there were an estimated 13,000 homeless children in the state of Washington. Today, that number is an estimate 32,000. At least 3,000 homeless children are enrolled in Seattle's public schools. And as Mayor Murray explains, the problem is not going away. ""We see the tents under freeways, rundown RVs in our neighborhoods, people on the sidewalks with signs that read 'disabled veteran, anything helps.' This is what income inequality looks like. This is what a disappearing middle class looks like."" As of this writing, Seattle police have not released descriptions of the suspects in the homeless encampment shooting, as they are still interviewing witnesses.

(Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) (Matt Sayles) PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Gun violence was on the minds of more than a few filmmakers this year.

157,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/motherjones/main/~3/DpBicPty7Ik/gun-manufacturers-subsidies-southern-states,"Production line at the Smith & Wesson factory in Springfield, MassachusettsCharles Krupa/AP  In January 2013, a month after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the state of New York passed gun control legislation that included a ban on the retail sale of assault weapons. Soon after, Remington Outdoor Company, the maker of the Bushmaster assault rifle used in the massacre, announced it would lay off workers at its 200-year-old factory in Ilion and move production to Huntsville, Alabama. Then CEO George Kollitides explained in a letter to New York officials that the move was brought on by “state policies affecting use of our products.” The gun lobby crowed about political payback: “We hope that sends a very strong message,” remarked then National Rifle Association’s president, Jim Porter, on an NRA radio show. What Porter didn’t mention was what Alabama had done to sweeten the deal: By relocating to Huntsville, Remington, a $1 billion firearms conglomerate owned by the Manhattan private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, would receive state and local grants, tax breaks, and other incentives worth approximately $69 million—the equivalent of getting about $14 from every resident of Alabama. Since 2003, state and local governments from Alabama to Tennessee have given more than $120 million worth of taxpayer funds to at least seven major firearms companies, according to research by Mother Jones. Most of those subsidies—nearly $100 million—have been pledged just over the past three years by states seeking to lure gun producers from the Northeast, where new firearm regulations have angered industry leaders. “I’ve had CEOs in New England tell me that the offers from states’ economic development teams are so extraordinary that they could essentially move their factories for free,” Larry Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Federation, told Guns & Ammo. “In some cases they’ve received these offers almost daily over extended periods of time.” After Maryland passed stringent new gun regulations in 2013, Beretta announced it would shutter its factory there and relocate to a state that has shown “consistent, strong support for Second Amendment rights,” as its attorney, Jeff Reh, put it at the time. But politics wasn’t the only factor in Beretta’s move. The city of Gallatin, Tennessee, eventually won the new factory after it offered Beretta $14.4 million in state and local subsidies. “The level of community support was better,” a Beretta spokesman acknowledged in the Charlotte Business Journal, explaining why that city had lost its bid for the plant. Southern states have long relied on financial and regulatory incentives to attract manufacturers from more industrialized parts of the country. “I think Remington is doing what Mercedes did for us in the automobile business—it opens the door to opportunity,” Porter told the Birmingham Business Journal. Yet Porter suggested gun companies would enjoy an exceptional welcome: “You will have the support of the administration, you will have the support of the population—everybody in the state is going to be lining up to work for Remington.” Major politicians have gone the extra mile to attract gun companies. In wooing the Beretta factory, Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam flew to Italy and met with the Beretta family in a posh wine country villa. Haslam later invited Franco Gussalli Beretta, the head of the company’s American subsidiary, to the governor’s mansion for dinner. Nobody in Tennessee seemed to object to the deal’s $14.4 million price tag. “We believe that our brand as the state of Tennessee has taken on new luster because Beretta has chosen to locate here,” Haslan said at the groundbreaking ceremony, “and we are forever grateful.” Another incentive for gun companies to relocate south has been lax labor laws. In an interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader, a Sturm Ruger spokesman admitted the company built a new plant in North Carolina instead of expanding an existing one in Newport, New Hampshire, because it wanted to set up shop in a right-to-work state. Similarly, Remington’s move from New York to Alabama, another right-to-work state, decimated the New York plant’s trade union. Some Northeastern states have also funneled tax dollars to the firearms industry. Between 2009 and 2014, New York-based Kimber Manufacturing received nearly $1 million in tax abatements and state and local grants—money meant to ensure the company would keep cranking out upwards of 150,000 handguns a year with its factory in Yonkers. Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts have also offered incentives to attract or retain gun manufacturers. But most such enticements are now in the South. Here are the seven gun companies that have received state and local subsidies in recent years: Remington Arms, Madison, North CarolinaMove: Owned by a New York private equity fund, Remington in 2014 laid off more than 100 workers at its 200-year-old unionized factory in Ilion, New York (the site of its original headquarters) and opened a new nonunion factory in Huntsville, Alabama.Subsidy: $68.9 million in cash, worker training, tax abatements, real estate, and construction work from state and local governments. The company also received nearly $12 million in grants, tax credits, and other benefits from New York, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Oklahoma in exchange for training workers and expanding or retaining factories. Sturm Ruger,  Southport, ConnecticutMove:  In 2014, the nation’s largest gun company opened a new factory in Mayodan, North Carolina, instead of expanding an existing factory in New Hampshire.Subsidy: $15.5 million in state tax breaks, employee training, infrastructure construction, and other incentives. The company has also received $150,288 in training subsidies from New Hampshire. Berretta USA, Accokeek, MarylandMove: The Italian gun maker last year closed its Maryland plant and moved all US production to a massive factory in Gallatin, Tennessee.Subsidy: The company will receive $10.41 million in state-funded building improvements and job training grants. The town of Gallatin also kicked in land and tax abatements worth nearly $4 million. Smith & Wesson, Springfield, Massachusetts.Move: Publicly traded Smith & Wesson announced in 2010 that it would move its hunting rifle division from New Hampshire to Springfield, Massachusetts.Subsidy: $6.6 million in state and local tax breaks. The company has also received $158,791 in worker-training subsidies from Massachusetts. Colt’s Manufacturing, Hartford, ConnecticutMove: In 2011 Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced a deal in which the 180-year-old gun company would open a factory in Kissimmee, saying it showed the state was “a defender of our right to bear arms.” But then Colt walked away from the project for unknown reasons. The company declared bankruptcy last year.Subsidy: $1.66 million in state and local incentives. Government officials are now trying to claw back the money. O.F. Mossberg & Sons, North Haven, Connecticut.Move: The world’s largest manufacturer of pump-action shotguns has gradually shifted manufacturing from Connecticut to a factory in Eagle Pass, Texas. In 2014, it added 116,000 square feet to the factory, which now accounts for 90 percent of its production.Subsidy: A $300,000 grant in 2014 from the taxpayer-funded Texas Enterprise Fund. Kimber Manufacturing, Elmsford, New YorkMove: America’s largest manufacturer of 1911 pistols hasn’t moved out of New York—at least not yet. In 2012 the company warned that the state’s NY SAFE gun control law might “cause it to reconsider its current expansion.”Subsidy: In 2009, Kimber received a $700,000 state grant to expand its manufacturing capacity in Yonkers. In 2012 and 2013, it received nearly $300,000 in local tax credits.  Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

A controversial plan to remove four public monuments related to the confederacy in the city of New Orleans is one step closer to happening after a judge denied a request for a temporary restraining order by local preservationists. (AP) A judge ruled Tuesday that New Orleans can move forward with plans to take down its storied Confederate monuments, but the job is big, and won't be easy. The City Council voted last month to take down public statues honoring Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, P.G.T Beauregard and a white militia group, months after a racially-charged mass shooting in South Carolina touched off a national debate over Confederate symbols. Historians and preservationists balked, saying the iconic monuments are part of the city's past, but a federal judge's denial of their bid for an injunction means the markers can come down. “That’s just verbiage and rhetoric. There are no specifics on plans for any of the monuments."" “We are pleased with the court’s sound ruling on this issue,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said in a statement. “Once removed, the monuments will be stored in a city-owned warehouse until further plans can be developed for a private park or museum site where the monuments can be put in a fuller context. Additional details will be announced as they become available.” City leaders told the New Orleans Advocate they would not remove the statues until the ruling, but did not provide further details. The contractor who was slated to do the work dropped the job after receiving death threats. David Mahler, owner of H&O Investments in Baton Rouge, was set to take on the job, but backed out after employees received death threats and other vendors threatened to stop doing business with the firm. Despite his unconditional surrender, arsonists torched his $200,000 Lamborghini in a move he believes was related to the monuments. “I don’t know if this has anything to do with a job he was recently CONTRACTED to do and decided not to take or if there is another reason, but it makes me sad that someone would go this far,” his wife wrote in a Facebook post last week. “The hate in this world is too thick so I’ll be the bigger person and only spread love back.” Last fall, Tulane professor Richard Marksbury made a tongue-in-cheek proposal that if New Orleans intends to purge all symbols of the Confederacy that it must take down its famous statue of Andrew Jackson as well. It is now unclear who might take the statues down. Tulane University Professor Richard Marksbury, who has long been an advocate for keeping all monuments in New Orleans intact, said opponents will try to stop the city in state court. “[The judge] was suggesting that he didn’t believe that it should have been heard in federal court,” he said. The Dean of Continuing Studies made the proposal to make the point that no historical momuments should be taken down due to contemporary rhetoric. Marksbury is skeptical of the city's plan to exhibit the statues in another venue, and fears they could disappear or be damaged. “That’s just verbiage and rhetoric,” he said to FoxNews.com. “There are no specifics on plans for any of the monuments."" When thousands of tourists descend upon the city next month, Marksbury predicts the statues will be standing, at Lee Circle, the entrance to City Park, at Mid-City and at the foot of Iberville Street. “If the Lee Monument is not moved in two weeks, you have Mardi Gras -- where thousands of people will be near and around it of all races,"" Marksbury said. ""It won’t be an issue.

163,http://www.startribune.com/variety/stageandarts/366870061.html,"When actor Jessica Dickey heard there had been a mass shooting in an Amish community not far from where she had grown up in Waynesboro, Pa., part of her soul went dim. Five youngsters were massacred at the one-room West Nickel Mines School by a gunman who then committed suicide. The 2006 incident showed that a world she’d always seen as removed from modernity was not so distant after all. Dickey, 37, until then only a performer, decided to take a stab at crafting a play around the subject. The result is “The Amish Project,” her much-heralded solo show that be­gins previews Tuesday in the Guth­­rie’s Dowling Studio. “Amish” raises important questions around trauma, responsibility and forgiveness. Dickey knew right off the bat that she did not want to craft a docudrama. For one thing, that would’ve been too painful. Instead, she opted for a fictional meditation on the people and the events. “Just hearing about the shooting was gut-wrenching enough,” she said. “It was a really gruesome crime and I didn’t want to knock on doors and rub raw the living memories of people carrying that tragedy.” She also wanted to muse on something that was as striking to her as it is rare. The families of the victims immediately forgave the killer, a milk truck driver, even reaching out to his family as fellow victims.

                                            Jessica Dickey plays seven roles in “The Amish Project,” which she also wrote. “There was a mysterious spiritual transaction between the Amish and the gunman via his surviving family that was startling,” Dickey said. “The pendulum swung, from about the worst thing we can be to each other, to about the best. That really caught me.” Dickey plays seven roles, including a pair of Amish girls, the gunman, his widow and residents of Nickel Mines. The project’s trajectory is almost a fairy tale for any budding playwright. After Dickey completed the play, it premiered in the New York Fringe Festival. Booked for a 2009 run at New York’s Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, it got the attention of a New York Times critic who called her performance “extraordinary” and the play “remarkable.” She has performed “Amish” all over the country. She also has had others perform it, both as a solo piece and with acting ensembles. Experiment in engagement “Amish” is part of a Guthrie series of solo shows called Singular Voices/Plural Perspectives that began last fall with Aaron Davidman’s “Wrestling Jerusalem,” about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. It continues March 18-19 with “Taylor Mac: The 20th Century Abridged” and Colman Domingo’s “A Boy and His Soul” (Aug. 9-28). Each performance will be followed by a conversation with the audience. “The idea is to test some notions about how best to engage our community going forward,” said Guthrie artistic director Joe Haj. “We were thrilled by the community response to our nightly conversations after each performance of ‘Wrestling Jerusalem’ and we were shown that there is great appetite in the Twin Cities for the Guthrie to create room for such dialogue.” While Dickey has written other works since, her sole solo show is the one that keeps pulling her back onstage. Sadly, continuing tragedies have made its themes evergreen. Also, fictionalizing the story allowed her the freedom to inject moments of light and levity and to meditate on a grim situation. “I feel strongly that one has the right to tell any story, but that’s not how I was raised,” she said. It caused her to examine her own upbringing and her reactions to the subject. Most people hold on to a sense of punitive justice — “an eye-for-an-eye” and all that — but the Amish sought quickly to end the cycle of violence. After the shooting occurred, the Amish quickly razed the school and planted grass where the killings had taken place. Dickey visited the site. “Animals graze there now,” she said. “When you’re there, you don’t necessarily feel the residue of what happened. As an outsider, I see the wishing in that. Somehow, whatever cycle of violence and suffering led to this massive outburst of grief and suffering will end. There is something about the grieved parties being willing to absorb the pain and not let it ripple onward and pass to the next victim that’s really heroic, but also challenging to reckon with.”  Rohan Preston covers theater for the Star Tribune.

164,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/135359269/0/phoenix/politics~Rep-Martha-McSally-to-correct-campaignfinance-reports/,"WASHINGTON — Arizona Rep. Martha McSally’s campaign committee will amend numerous campaign-finance reports Sunday to try to resolve nagging problems with the accuracy and completeness of her disclosures to the Federal Election Commission. The amendments are the result of an expensive, intensive effort by her committee to address questions raised by the FEC about contributors who exceeded donation limits; incomplete and omitted information for some donations and expenditures; and a lack of information about donors' occupations and employers. The issue has been a blemish on what has been a fast start to the political career of the former Air Force pilot and fighter-squadron commander. “It is important to understand these errors were … of FEC reporting. No funds were mismanaged, lost or misspent,” her campaign manager, Weston McKee, said in a written statement that was part of a detailed explanation provided to The Arizona Republic. McKee said that as a result of the committee's ""unprecedented"" eight-month review, “lessons were learned and systems are in place ensuring they are not repeated.” The review found the committee raised about $6.41 million and spent about $5.95 million from 2012 through 2014. That compares to previously reported totals of $6.13 million raised and $6.11 million spent during the period. The campaign also will report refunding $42,600 in contributions and identifying another $6,680 given from anonymous sources that will be donated to local charities. AZCENTRAL Mystery of Rep. Martha McSally's unidentified donors may be solved McKee said the key factor contributing to the incorrect and incomplete disclosure reports was the large number of donations — 83,900 contributions from 35,400 individuals — the freshman Republican received. “This creates unique challenges not faced by nearly all other campaigns and professional treasurers,” McKee said in his statement. In the first nine months of last year, McSally ranked second among House members in fundraising — trailing only House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. McSally first ran for Congress in early 2012, losing in an April primary that was part of a special election to replace Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords resigned after being wounded in a mass shooting at an event at a Tucson-area shopping center. McSally ran a second time that fall, losing a close race to Democrat Ron Barber. McSally defeated Barber in November 2014. The problems with McSally’s campaign-finance reporting began with her first filings in 2012, and her committee has received 14 letters from the FEC pointing out errors and omissions and asking for additional information. During that time, her committee has gone through five treasurers. In May 2015, the committee hired three people with experience in campaign reporting. One, Chris Marston of North Rock Reports and Elections CFO, along with his team conducted the comprehensive of past reports. Marston will be paid $30,000 for the audit. Their review focused on the following problems: Errors in how much cash the campaign had at the beginning and end of reporting periods.Excessive contributions. FEC regulations allow a committee to ask donors who have exceeded campaign-donation limits whether they want to attribute the excess amount to a spouse or assign the additional amount to a different election period. The money also may be refunded. Refunds were made to 20 contributors who made excessive contributions.Contributions from unclear sources. These involved potentially illegal contributions from corporations and cases in which the imprint on the check was not clear, or cash was given anonymously. In each case, when the committee could not resolve the matter, it refunded contributions. The auditors also tried to correct some instances in which disbursements were not properly itemized, and to obtain the occupation and employer of individual donors when that information had not been provided. The FEC has repeatedly flagged the lack of information about individual donors in letters to the campaign. Donors are not required to provide the information, but campaign committees must show they made a good-faith effort to obtain it. The campaign said it has always been in compliance because the information was requested when the donations were first made. Last fall, a Tucson woman, with help from the Pima County Democratic Party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, filed a complaint against the McSally campaign with the FEC, claiming its failure to collect donors' identifying data violated campaign-finance laws and regulations. The FEC does not comment on pending complaints. McSally is seeking a second full term and is being challenged by Democrats Dr. Matt Heinz and Victoria Steele. Campaign finance reports for the final quarter of 2015 must be filed by midnight Sunday.",2016-01-30 02:04:02,Rep. Martha McSally to correct campaign-finance reports,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

There’s Dark Night, Under the Gun and shorts such as Speaking is Difficult, but none bring home the aftermath of a mass shooting event like Newtown. That might be because there hasn’t been an event quite like Newtown in US history. The name itself has become synonymous with gun violence after 26 people, 20 of whom were children, were killed at Sandy Hook elementary school in December 2012.  Unlike Under the Gun, a polemic that seeks to change views on gun control, Newtown has survivors, their families and their community bearing witness. The victims’ stories and lives are told, from Daniel Barden, a dead seven-year-old who is central to Under the Gun’s narrative, to Dylan Hockley, a six-year-old also murdered that day in December. Director Kim A Snyder, of Welcome to Shelbyville, places narrators in front of a clinical backdrop that leaves all the focus on them and their stories. Even without the minimalist aesthetic, there’s no way you could take your eyes off the talking heads. The medic who was a first responder on the scene talks about the day itself, how she initially thought there was only one victim who would survive their wounds, before she realized the full scope of the shooting. The priest who conducted dozens of funerals for the school children recalls his work. The Barden’s neighbors talk about their life before the shooting (weekly pizza nights) and after it devastated their town (stilted, difficult exchanges). Police officers and the town’s doctor shake through their testimony, with shock, yes, but also palpable disgust. We see parents petitioning politicians in Congress; brothers and sisters protesting, but most affecting is the sight of parents trying to carry on and make sense of what has happened. Mark Barden and other family members affected by the shooting form a group – Sandy Hook Promise – in order to raise awareness of gun violence and also stop something like this happening again. Some become unlikely activists, while others try to put their lives back together and regain some sort of normalcy. But the thing that comes through most in the documentary is that the event will never ever leave them or the community, and should not leave us. Snyder uses her camera as a friendly ear and as an eye to bear witness. Gun control and gun rights are clearly in the mix but the truth about what happened and why it happened are the mystery her film scrutinizes. It’s a shocking and compelling piece of work.",2016-01-30 13:43:04,Newtown review: minimalist aesthetic places focus on personal stories,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

169,http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/01/why_gun_owners_distrust_presid.html,"Dean Rieck is executive director of the Buckeye Firearms Association. Guest columnist Dean Rieck is Executive Director of Buckeye Firearms Association. President Obama has expressed dismay that gun owners and Second Amendment advocacy groups such as Buckeye Firearms Association and the NRA don't trust him on the issue of gun control. He has even mocked gun owners as ""conspiracy"" minded and paranoid. But gun owners have many perfectly logical reasons to distrust the President. He presents a false crisis. In a New York Times op-ed, Obama claims ""The epidemic of gun violence in this country is a crisis."" But as he himself has admitted, the murder rate has been declining for years and has, in fact, reached historically low levels. And of the approximately 30,000 gun deaths each year, two-thirds are suicides, not murder. He resorts to bait and switch. Obama repeatedly refers to mass shootings to justify more gun control. During the CNN townhall recently, he suggested ""sensible background checks"" so that families ""don't have to go through what the families at Newtown or San Bernadino or Charleston went through."" But because guns used in these and other recent mass shootings came from licensed dealers, criminal background checks obviously did not stop these crimes. In addition, mass shootings aren't the problem. According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2013, 33,636 people died from firearm deaths. According to the Mass Shooting Tracker, just 502 of those deaths were from mass shootings. That's less than 1.5 percent. His record is clearly anti-gun. During his political career, Obama has supported gun registration for law-abiding gun owners, supported the idea that any city should be able to ban guns whenever they want, voted to allow predatory lawsuits intended to bankrupt the firearms industry, and supported a ban on the sale or transfer of all forms of semi-automatic weapons, which are ordinary and highly popular guns used by both citizens and law-enforcement and represent the majority of guns sold today. Perhaps worst of all, he has infamously insulted gun owners by suggesting ""bitterness"" as the reason people ""cling to guns or religion"" and have ""antipathy to people who aren't like them."" His solutions invite abuse. In the White House ""Fact Sheet"" outlining Obama's Executive Actions, expanded background checks are offered as a way to ""keep guns out of the wrong hands."" This will be done by redefining when it's necessary to be licensed as a firearms dealer. However, the fact sheet also says, ""There is no specific threshold number of firearms purchased or sold that triggers the licensure requirement"" and suggests that it might be situations where ""as few as two firearms"" are sold or ""when only one or two transactions"" take place. So no one can ever know what is legal and what is illegal. That determination will be made on a case-by-case basis. And yet, those who violate this vague regulation can face criminal penalties of up to five years in prison and fines up to $250,000. Gun owners don't trust the President because, apparently, he doesn't trust us. His so-called solutions ignore real criminals and infringe on our Constitutional rights.

I’m on Bernie Sanders’ side policy-wise. I agree with many more of his positions than I do Hillary Clinton’s. I donated money to his campaign last year and I intend to vote for him in the Ohio primary in March. Still, the “Berniebro” phenomenon has left me feeling, well, Berned-out. I am referring to a certain demographic of Sanders supporter – white and male – who accuses anyone who’s not #FeelingTheBern of being a member of the “Establishment.”  It’s gotten bad enough that Bernie Sanders’ campaign rapid response director had to speak up about it on Twitter. It’s gotten bad enough that, among my circle of friends (who are mostly millennials about evenly split between supporting Clinton and Sanders in the primary), the “Berniebro” phenomenon immediately comes up whenever the election comes up. It’s not a new pattern. Remember the Obamatons back in 2008, who declared Hillary Clinton to be everything from a reincarnated Margaret Thatcher to Ronald Reagan in a pantsuit – despite the fact that Clinton had a near identical voting record to Obama’s and actually ran to his left on issues like healthcare. The worst trait of fundamentalists is their insistence that anyone who’s not on board with their revolution is part of a coordinated conspiracy to silence and suppress that revolution. You can watch in real time as any progressive public figure who refuses to openly endorse Sanders – whether or not they also endorse Clinton – gets bombarded by wave after wave of accusations of being on the take. Their hypocrisy, too, is distasteful. When black activists were singled out at a political rally for being “potentially disruptive”, many Bernie supporters were silent. And when detractors criticize Bernie about his record on gun control, or the fact that his healthcare agenda, unlike Clinton’s, never directly addresses reproductive rights, those people are often accused of being disingenuous shills using “identity politics” to enact the agenda of the big banks. If people find it off-putting or troubling that Sanders seems persistently unwilling to pivot away from his one-plank platform of attacking income inequality to talk about any other issue – be it police violence against black Americans or violence by Daesh overseas – they’re No True Leftists, because it’s self-evident to any true leftist that all issues should come back to economics. Hell, even when the Sanders campaign does something unambiguously and unarguably bad, like when one of their staffers gets caught accessing Clinton campaign data and is summarily fired for it, you hear Sanders people grumbling about how that staffer came from the Democratic National Convention and may possibly have been a plant. It’s a problem when a movement cannot accept criticism or dissenting views. When Sarah Jeong, a journalist and Bernie Sanders supporter, said she saw racist comments on Twitter linked to a #FeelTheBern account, a mob of trolls tried to chase her off the internet. Another woman, who said she personally likes and identifies with Hillary Clinton, was sent death threats. These are not isolated cases. The worst part is that I don’t think it is entirely confined to jerks on the internet – it’s been percolating its way up through the campaign, and has now even tinged the rhetoric of the candidate himself. Consider that Bernie Sanders called Planned Parenthood “The Establishment,” despite being primarily an organization that provides healthcare for the poor. That was after the group had been on the ropes for months from vicious, false attacks that culminated in a mass shooting last year. But when you’re fighting a “political revolution” and the entire atmosphere of your campaign is dripping with revolutionary zeal, then pretty quickly anyone who’s not with you is against you. It’s disappointing that Planned Parenthood’s choice to endorse Clinton over Sanders was a reason for Sanders to dismiss Planned Parenthood as yet another adversary to “take on”. What I’ve liked about Sanders as a person and a candidate so far has been that he’s better than his fans. In his time in the Senate he has done the hard work of making things happen within the existing system rather than piously opining on how the system is corrupt. He also started this campaign with a no-mudslinging pledge and the intention of improving the Democratic party rather than merely proving himself separate from and superior to it. I like the Bernie Sanders who, after his tiff with #BlackLivesMatter, went and listened to their concerns, listened to Sandra Bland’s family and #SaidHerName. I don’t like the version of him that reared his head when they first confronted him at Netroots Nation and in Seattle, storming out as though he’d been wronged. Many of Sanders’ supporters are young, impatient college graduates who love to see someone with a clear-cut set of beliefs running roughshod over the triangulating phonies. But if you’re one of the people being run roughshod over, and you feel you have legitimate concerns that don’t fit into that ideological model of progressivism, the revolution is a lot less appealing. Democratic politics does not work if you just talk and never shut up and listen. And right now the Sanders campaign isn’t doing that great a job at listening.",2016-02-02 10:17:16,I like Bernie Sanders. His supporters?

At the mosque and sprawling community center, located about 45 miles outside Washington in Baltimore County, the President will “affirm our conviction in the principle of religious liberty,” according to White House spokesman Josh Earnest. “Law-abiding Americans should be able to worship God in the way that they see fit, consistent with their religious heritage and traditions in a way that doesn’t subject them to either interference from the government or, frankly, divisive rhetoric on the campaign trail,” Earnest said Tuesday. The proliferation of terrorists from ISIS, the attacks in Paris and the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., have left the world on edge. That anxiety has led to fear and, in some cases, hatred and violence directed toward the Muslim community. “We’ve seen threats all over the country to mosques, we’ve seen shooting at mosques, vandalism threats and assaults targeting Muslims nationwide,” Ibrahim Hooper, a national spokesperson for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told TIME in December. Read More: What It’s Like to Be Muslim in America Post-Paris When Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. and other GOP candidates introduced proposals to either limit or halt the admission of refugees from majority-Muslim countries and Syria, Obama very quickly found himself having to repeatedly defend the protection of refugees and the right of Muslims to worship freely in America. “Just as it is the responsibility of Muslims around the world to root out misguided ideas that lead to radicalization, it is the responsibility of all Americans — of every faith — to reject discrimination,” Obama said in his Oval Office address to the nation on the strategy against ISIS. During remarks at a naturalization ceremony in Washington, the President said all Americans “must resolve to always speak out against hatred and bigotry in all of its forms — whether taunts against the child of an immigrant farmworker or threats against a Muslim shopkeeper.” And in his 2016 State of the Union address, the President said Americans have a responsibility to “reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn’t a matter of political correctness. It’s a matter of understanding what makes us strong.” The President will have an opportunity to relay that message to community members directly on Wednesday when he meets with about a dozen leaders before his public remarks. He’ll seek to reinforce, too, that his Administration doesn’t simply consider Muslim Americans through a national-security lens, but through the important role the community plays in American society. He’ll also have an opportunity to hear directly from leaders in the community about what issues are impacting them and what their concerns are. Given the political climate today, and the reports that anti-Muslim activity is on the rise across the U.S., there’s likely a lot on Muslims’ minds. In fact, the Islamic Society of Baltimore, where Obama will visit, was the subject of threats last year. In May, CBS Baltimore reported someone called the mosque and threatened to “spill Muslim blood.” Zainab Chaudry, the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ outreach manager in Maryland, says a building on the property of another mosque nearby was firebombed last fall. Though Chaudry says the firebombing is not believed to have been a hate crime, it all contributes to the fear and uncertainty felt by many Muslims in that community. “I’ve had many parents call me and tell me that they’re scared for their children’s safety when they are in school or away from them because they don’t know what kind of incidents they’re going to be subjected to,” Chaudry says. The roundtable could also provide leaders within the Muslim community to express their concern about the federal government’s initiatives on countering violent extremism. Advocates within the Muslim community have said the initiatives target them, and Chaudry says she is hopeful the opportunity will arise to discuss this and other policies that alienate segments of the Muslim community. “They may be well intentioned, but the way that they are framed in some cases helps to reinforce that sense of fear towards Muslims and Islam,” she says. Overall, Chaudry tells TIME that members of the community are looking forward to an opportunity to engage with the President and hopefully send a broader message to those spewing hateful rhetoric. “This election has been one of most, if not the most, Islamophobic in its tone,” she said. “We’re hoping that this will send a strong message to, specifically candidates who are taking public office, but anyone who has a platform. And encourages them to speak more responsibly.” Contact us at letters@time.com.",2016-02-02 18:01:11,Obama Will Visit a Mosque for the First Time as President,,40362,http://www.time.com/time/

 	        | Capitol Buzz: Five things to watch today in Tallahassee »  @ByKristenMClark Florida's 160 lawmakers could inconspicuously pack heat in the state House and Senate chambers and legislative meetings, under a provision tacked on to a controversial open-carry handguns proposal that's expected to pass the Florida House on Wednesday. The amendment by Rep. John Wood, R-Winter Haven, was one of almost two dozen proposed changes that representatives vetted -- and a handful they approved -- during three hours of debate that stretched past 9 p.m. Tuesday over two high-profile gun bills. The measures alter how 1.4 million people with concealed weapons permits in Florida can carry handguns. The Republican-dominated House accepted Wood's idea by a 72-43 vote to allow lawmakers to carry concealed guns in legislative sessions and official meetings, but it's possible the change could prove fatal for the measure, which already faced a tough climb in the Senate. Both the open-carry measure and another that would allow permit-holders to carry concealed on public university and college campuses are likely to pass the House. But across the Capitol, Senate Judiciary Chairman Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, said he won't hear the campus-carry proposal in his committee for the second year in a row, and he indicated last week he could change his mind and not hear the open-carry plan, either. The two measures are endorsed by the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups, but opponents cite numerous safety concerns. Heading into Tuesday's House debate, more than 40 amendments were filed to the open-carry bill but almost half were later withdrawn; those were mostly rebuttals that bill sponsor and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, initially sought. All but one of the others -- Wood's -- were filed by Democrats, as an attempt to chip away at the proposal and add exclusions to where concealed-carry permit-holders could openly carry. Each Democratic amendment failed by wide margins with almost entirely Republican support. The Democrats' suggestions included measures to: -- limit high-capacity magazines on openly carried weapons, -- restrict foreigners seeking U.S. citizenship from receiving a concealed weapons permit, -- and prohibit the open-carrying of handguns within 500 feet of movie theaters, religious institutions, voting locations, school safety zones and bars or restaurants that serve alcohol. To plead their case of why the safeguards were needed, Democrats invoked several mass-shooting incidents from recent years. Among them: the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting two months ago, the Charleston, S.C., church shooting last summer, the Aurora, Co., movie theater shooting and Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., both in 2012, and the attempted assassination of an Arizona congresswoman in 2011. Republicans and moderate Democrats said the incidents cited weren't relevant to the debate and they rejected the amendments as unnecessary, redundant or an infringement on residents' Second Amendment rights. ""This amendment has nothing to do with what happened at those particular places or those particular tragic incidents. No open carry was at issue there,"" Rep. Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, D-Tallahassee, said of the proposed restriction near churches. She co-sponsored the campus-carry bill. Gaetz has promoted his open-carry bill as a means to ""vindicate"" Floridians' Second Amendment rights. The Florida Police Chiefs Association supports it, but groups representing sheriffs and police officers are opposed.  Critics argue that having Florida join 45 other states that allow open carry could harm its tourist industry and subject residents to ""intimidation"" when gun-owners carry in public. The measure was earlier amended to specify the right of private property owners -- from grocery stores and churches to Disney World and Sea World -- to decide whether to allow patrons to carry weapons concealed, openly or at all. Republicans argued that provision was sufficient to ease opponents' concerns about where people might openly carry, but that only frustrated Democrats further. ""We’ve become so inflexible on this issue that we can’t even agree that guns don’t belong within 1 foot of a church,"" said Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Coral Springs, who sponsored most of the Democratic amendments. ""It’s OK to infringe on the right to bear arms at Disney World -- you’re all OK with that -- but you’re not willing to do it within 1 foot of a church."" Among the approved amendments, though, was a compromise offered by Gaetz that addressed one concern Democrats discussed last week in committee; it would allow public hospitals to restrict guns from being openly carried. Other changes approved were redundant measure that cancelled out Moskowitz's proposed changes affecting foreigners, permanent non-U.S. residents and people visiting the U.S. on visas. Gaetz successfully added language banning illegal immigrants from receiving conceal-carry permits -- which is already prohibited under state law, as Gaetz acknowledged. Wood said he sought the conceal-carry exemption for lawmakers because ""we allow the judiciary -- an equal co-branch of government -- to have that privilege."" ""It should be enjoyed by duly elected officials, such as ourselves,"" he said. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, filed a related bill this session to lift restrictions and let all legally permitted gun-owners carry concealed in most any government meeting at the local, county and state level but it hasn't been heard. Earlier in the evening, House members also debated the so-called ""guns on campus"" bill by Steube and Rehwinkel Vasilinda, which is on track to stall for the second year. Steube spent an hour answering questions from more than a dozen lawmakers, most of them Democrats. Their questions targeted the safety of allowing guns on college and university campuses -- environments, they argued, that can include parties with alcohol and potentially drugs, young adults facing mentally and emotionally stressful situations and children who attend daycare, camps or charter school programs. ""I think that people should have the right to defend themselves, and our gun-free zones have shown themselves to be targets time and time again for terrorists and mass shooters,"" Steube said. He added that he's not ""not trying to deputize or have a quasi-police force in concealed permit holders."" He dismissed assertions that law enforcement wouldn't be able to tell ""good guys"" from ""bad guys"" in active-shooter situations, because he said officers are trained to know the difference. College and university presidents and police chiefs resoundingly oppose the proposal, as do some faculty and student groups and the League of Women Voters. But Steube said he's heard from professors, staff and students who want it. In responding to questions, Steube said multiple times that he knows of no data that proves allowing concealed guns on campuses would increase crime. He rejected that the bill would impose costs on colleges and universities, although those institutions have said they'd have to spend tens of millions of dollars to beef up security and training for campus police forces, should the proposal become law. Steube twice deflected questions about what impact his bill would have if it and Gaetz's open-carry measure were both enacted, but Gaetz later addressed it. ""Yes, under those circumstances, it would be permissible to have open carry on campus,"" Gaetz said. Photo credit: The Florida Channel Posted by Kristen M.

Politics http://fus.in/1PRQhaj Copied to clipboard President Obama is not coming to take your guns away. He promises. Capping off a week largely focused on addressing America’s gun violence epidemic, the president spoke to a room full of constituents from across the political spectrum during a live town hall meeting Thursday night, broadcasted on CNN. It was a mostly hushed affair, moderated by CNN’s Anderson Cooper. By my count, the first applause for one of the president’s comments came about 32 minutes and 15 seconds into the meeting. But in the second half of the discussion, which lasted just over an hour, a few other remarks from the president drew applause from the mixed audience. That was when he addressed the popular fringe theory that his administration has a master plan to take guns away from rightful owners.  The discussion was prompted by a question from Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and husband of Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona U.S. Representative who was nearly killed by a gunshot to the head in a 2011 mass shooting incident. His question, in part: …[W]hen we testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we heard not only from the gun lobby, but from United States senators that expanding background checks will—not may—will lead to a registry, which will lead to confiscation, which will lead to a tyrannical government. So I would like you to explain, with 350 million guns in in 65 million places, households, from Key West to Alaska, 350 million objects in 65 million places: if the federal government wanted to confiscate those objects, how would they do that? After rambling for almost a full minute about how good it was to see Gifford, and after saying how proud he is of Kelly’s twin brother, who is currently setting the world record for the longest continuous orbit around the earth, Obama finally responded to the hypothetical. Here’s the president’s exchange with Cooper on the subject, with some added notes for clarity: Obama: What I think Mark is getting to is, like I said earlier, this notion of a conspiracy out there, and it gets wrapped up in concerns about the federal government. Now there’s a long history of that. That’s in our DNA. You know? The United States was born suspicious of some distant authority. Cooper: Let me just tell you … Is it fair to call it a conspiracy? A lot of people really believe this deeply, that they just don’t trust you. Obama: I’m sorry, Grouper [sic] yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy. [Applause] What are you saying? Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody’s guns away so that we can impose martial law is not a conspiracy? Yes, that is a conspiracy! I would hope that you would agree with that. Is that controversial? Except on some websites around the country? Cooper: There are some lot of people who just have a fundamental distrust that you do not want to get, go further and further and further down this road. (Note: Cooper’s comment doesn’t really make sense. Save the headache and don’t try to decipher it, but yes, this is a direct transcription.) Obama: Look, I, [stammering his words]… I’m only gonna be here for another year. I don’t know. When would I have started on this enterprise? Right? [Again stammering on his words for a few seconds, before sighing very heavily and changing subjects.] Throughout the meeting, Obama downplayed the notion that this week’s executive order will live up to the nightmare scenario described above. “This is about enforcing laws,” he said. Any major legal changes would have to go through Congress, he argued, exuding confidence that the order was well within his presidential rights to enforce the law. When answering a question from a young black man from Chicago whose brother died to gun violence, the president even characterized his action as a “modest way of us getting started” on gun reform. The rest is out of his hands, he said. Surprisingly, the leaders of the National Rifle Association, which Obama repeatedly called out as having a “stranglehold” on sensible gun discussion, agree with his assessment, even as they fought against the executive order tooth and nail, and refused to attend Thursday’s meeting, while their headquarters was just down the street. “This is it, really?” Jennifer Baker, the NRA’s director of public affairs, told The New York Times on Tuesday. “This is what they’ve been hyping for how long now? This is the proposal they’ve spent seven years putting together?” “They’re not really doing anything,” she said. Tell it to the batshit forums that are going in on this, Baker. It’s crazy out there.

Insecurity State http://fus.in/1Z2aFGa Copied to clipboard Mass shootings were a horribly frequent occurrence in 2015. To kick off 2016, the White House announced that it plans to use its executive authority to improve gun control because Congress is unable to pass any significant legislation. Among President Obama’s proposals is the adoption of “smart gun technology” by the government so that it’s harder for people to shoot guns that don’t belong to them. What this basically boils down to is a biometric gun lock. Noting that tens of thousands of people are injured or killed by firearms yearly, “in many cases by guns that were sold legally but then stolen, misused, or discharged accidentally,” President Obama wrote in a memo sent out Monday that he wants to “expedite the real-world deployment of [gun safety] technology,” such as guns that require owners’ fingerprints before firing. Obama wants a joint report within 90 days from the Defense Secretary, the Attorney General, and the Homeland Security Secretary on how to make this happen. Part of that real-world deployment would involve the U.S. government itself using the safety tech. “The Federal Government has a unique opportunity to do so, as it is the single largest purchaser of firearms in the country,” wrote Obama. There are a number of different tech options out there thanks to interest from start-ups, as noted in a Computer World editorial last month: Smart guns make guns safer in a variety of ways. Some use fingerprint readers so that only authorized users can fire the gun. Others, such as iGun use RFID technology so that only someone who holds or wears a specific object like a ring can fire it. SGTi can retrofit existing guns with fingerprint readers. It will be welcome news in Silicon Valley, where influential venture capitalist Ron Conway has been pushing smart gun technology since the 2013 Newtown shooting, in which the shooter used his mother’s gun. It’s not easy trying to introduce smart gun tech though. When Smith & Wesson promised the Clinton administration it would introduce smart guns 15 years ago, it was boycotted by the gun lobby. “Factories closed, employees were laid off, and after that, no big U.S. gunmaker ever went near a smart gun,” reported 60 Minutes. As the New York Times noted in 2014, gun enthusiasts remain skeptical and antagonistic toward start-ups in the smart gun space: Second Amendment defenders argue that once guns with high-tech safety features go on sale, government mandates will follow. They cite a decade-old New Jersey law requiring that within three years of the recognition technology’s becoming available in the United States, all guns sold in the state would have to be “smart.” While the mainstream adoption of tech that makes guns slightly harder to shoot would likely cut down on accidental discharges, kids killing each other with their parents’ guns, and shootings with stolen guns, it obviously has limitations in addressing America’s mass shooting problem. Technology, as usual, is not a universal cure. Many deaths by firearms are performed by the legal owner of a gun, meaning a fingerprint scanner wouldn’t prevent them. Until a smart gun is able to detect that it is pointed at a human being, with artificial intelligence that can scan the situation and the mindset of the person holding the gun as well as the psychological profile of the person at whom the gun is aimed, we’re not going to be able to solve America’s gun problem completely with technology.

180,http://elitedaily.com/news/fbi-arrests-man-planning-attack/1362704/," A 23-year-old Milwaukee man was arrested Tuesday for allegedly planning to carry out an attack on a Masonic temple, NBC News reports. According to prosecutors, Samy Mohamed Hamzeh was charged with the unlawful purchase and possession of firearms, as well as the possession of an illegal machine gun. The FBI arranged a fake buy for the weapons after informants notified the agency of Hamzeh's plans to target and attack a local Masonic temple. The FBI first began investigating Hamzeh in September. In October, an informant reported Hamzeh was planning to travel to the West Bank and kill Israeli citizens. He soon, however, abandoned that plan and decided to stage a domestic attack instead. Speaking with an informant of his plans to attack the temple, Hamzeh said, Hamzeh identifies as a Muslim, saying his attack was a means to âdefend Muslim religion""; however, he is not affiliated with any known terror groups. In a statement, acting US Attorney Gregory J. Haanstad said, If the attack was carried out, it would have been the second mass shooting to hit the Milwaukee area in less than four years. In 2012, a white supremacist named Wade Michael Page shot and killedÂ six people at a Sikh temple in nearby Oak Creek.

Judge Thomas Goethals is fourth from right, back row.  Judge Thomas Goethals is far left, front row.  Defense attorney Scott Sanders, center, is credited with revealing that prosecutors misused jailhouse informants and withheld evidence in murder cases – included the case against mass killer Scott Dekraai.  Judge Thomas Goethals listens to attorneys in his courtroom in superior court in Santa Ana.  Judge Thomas Goethals in his Santa Ana courtroom. The judge received national attention for removing D.A. from Seal Beach shooting case.  Thomas M. Goethals, a devout man with a keen appreciation for history, wrote to the White House so that his wife, a professional decorator and three-time cancer survivor, could help put up Christmas decorations there last fall. Volunteers climbed ladders and strung garlands, and after days of work, when spouses were invited to join a dinner with first lady Michelle Obama, Goethals delighted in roaming the halls and trying out couches where so many great leaders have sat. The veteran Orange County Superior Court judge was especially enthralled by the portrait of Abraham Lincoln hanging in the State Dining Room. “My husband is a Lincoln fanatic,” said Patty Goethals, noting that the couple’s year-old grandson is named Lincoln. “Anything to do with Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War gives him so much joy. So he was just in heaven.” Thomas Goethals now finds himself, less happily, at the center of a different sort of public battle rooted in questions of moral conscience and constitutional justice. The case, which has unfolded in his 11th-floor chambers in downtown Santa Ana, involves the worst massacre in Orange County history – a 2011 attack in which Scott Dekraai, a one-time tugboat crewman, strode into a beauty salon in Seal Beach and opened fire, killing his ex-wife and seven others. No one doubts that Dekraai was the shooter. He was arrested only a few blocks from the scene and confessed to the crime. While in custody, however, and with other serious legal issues still looming – Was he legally sane? Would he be sentenced to death? – Dekraai was secretly tape recorded by members of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department using the aid of a jailhouse informant. A twist in the case  Scott Dekraai, left, with his attorney, Scott Sanders. The tapes and related evidence led to a startling turn in the legal proceedings. Goethals, acting in March on information unearthed by Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, took the extraordinary step of barring the Orange County District Attorney’s Office from participation in the trial’s penalty phase – a ruling now on appeal – and assigning the case instead to state Attorney General Kamala Harris. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas immediately denounced Goethals’ move as legally inappropriate. Tensions already were high between the D.A.’s office and the judge. Rackauckas’ prosecutors had spent most of the previous year steering cases away from Goethals’ courtroom, leaving it largely dormant for months. National news media seized on the clash and the misuse of criminal informants. “Dateline” and “20/20” have filmed in Goethals’ chambers for segments that have yet to air. “60 Minutes” has had its cameras rolling there in recent days. “I’ve never heard anything like it,” veteran defense attorney Gary M. Pohlson, one of Goethals’ closest friends and his former law partner, said of the judge’s ruling, which fanned the flames of a broadening scandal about the way police and prosecutors have used informants in the Orange County jail system. At least two other high-profile murder cases have unraveled due to practices laid bare in the Dekraai case – one involving gang member Leonel Vega, whose original life sentence in prison was cut to 15 years. Isaac John Palacios, a client of Pohlson’s who had admitted to killing a gang rival and faced charges of killing a second victim, was set free because information gleaned from informants was never properly divulged to the legal defense team, Pohlson said. “Law-enforcement actions caused a double-murderer to be released,” the attorney said. The human factor  Judge Goethals Besides stirring debate about the role of jailhouse snitches, Goethals’ ruling was notable for upholding the rights of an admitted mass-murderer despite the immense legal and political power of the county’s prosecuting apparatus. Goethals vividly illustrates the human element inherent in the legal system. For all of the rules and ideals of blind justice, cases can break in unexpected ways. Results swing on the decisions and interactions of people. “Judges are just like everybody else,” said Santa Ana-based attorney Ron Brower. “They have personal leanings and opinions. Those come into play.” Goethals, a Loyola Law School graduate who was appointed by then-Gov. Gray Davis in 2002 (he took the bench in January of 2003), is a man of relatively diverse background. He spent a dozen years as a defense lawyer in private practice with his former legal partner, Pohlson, and a dozen years before that as a lawyer in the Orange County District Attorney’s office – the same agency he so sternly rebuked. He is the rare jurist who has prosecuted a capital murder case, defended in a murder case and presided over a capital case as a judge. Goethals is known for helping to convict two of Orange County’s most prolific serial killers – Rodney Alcala and Randy Kraft, each of whom is awaiting execution. Trim, clean-cut and a couple inches shy of six feet tall, Goethals speaks with a voice both clear and emphatic. He and his wife Patty, who met on a blind date while Goethals attended Loyola High School in Los Angeles, now live in Newport Beach. They have three grown children, including a son, Patrick, who is a lawyer in Long Beach. Goethals declined to be interviewed because of the pending litigation. However, Patty Goethals described him as a physically active, outgoing person who at times is the life of the party. “He’s always the loudest person in the house,” she said. “He loves to laugh, loves to joke.” Passion for sports Goethals played football in high school – he was a blocking back in the old single-wing formation – and has been a runner much of his life, taking part for 14 years in the annual law enforcement relay race through the desert heat from Baker to Las Vegas, a grueling trek that once melted his shoes. These days, the 63-year-old judge only jogs, Patty Goethals said. “He calls it shuffling. He needs both knees to be replaced. He’s putting off having his knees done.” Were it not for his love of law, Goethals probably would have become a history professor, his wife said. He was raised in Glendale, the second born in a family of eight children. Despite the commotion of a crowded household, he seemed to earn A’s almost effortlessly. He majored in history at Santa Clara University but chose to follow the career path of his father Richard, a noted civil attorney, and his older brother Rick, who practiced law in San Francisco. “He has a photographic memory,” Patty Goethals said of her husband. “Tom can remember facts, details. We have a little ski boat we take out in the harbor – taking friends out on a cocktail cruise. He will talk to them about famous people who live on the bay, who ate at that restaurant, when that got built. He retains information so easily.” Goethals was 16 when his family bought a vacation house on the peninsula in Newport Beach. He became a body surfer and worked summer jobs as a city trash collector and as a submarine driver at Disneyland. He and Patty remain avid water skiers. They like to take their boat up to Lake Almanor, in the mountains near the Feather River in Northern California. They also travel to Carmel and to New York City, especially in the winter when the tree is up in Rockefeller Center. When home, they curl up on the couch and watch “Veep,” “Call the Midwife” and “Downton Abbey.” Goethals, who finds time to teach at Loyola and Whittier law schools, reads voraciously. Tom Clancy, Gore Vidal, Shelby Foote, Michael Shaara. He loves reading books about Winston Churchill, Patty Goethals said. In the years since Patty’s first cancer diagnosis in 1988, Goethals has given her steadfast support, she said. “He’s my rock and I don’t know what I’d do without him.” Staunch Catholics, the Goethals have spent 40 years attending tiny St. John Vianney Chapel on Balboa Island, where the judge is a lay eucharistic minister. “He will never miss a Sunday mass,” Patty said. In a county known for its conservative bench, Goethals has had a reputation, until recently, of being tough on certain types of crime. Sentencing in Orange County regarded as considerably more severe than in Los Angeles County, said Brower, the Santa Ana defense attorney, who has spent 45 years practicing law. Judges often have discretion in what evidence they allow and in how they mete out punishment. In a narcotics case, for example, some lean toward ordering substance abuse treatment, while others favor incarceration, Brower said. “(Goethals) would always listen to treatment options – he was never closed-minded – but he’d come down more on the severe side in that kind of case,” Brower said. The attorney described Goelthals as being a “severe, no-nonsense judge” in dealing with domestic violence and other types of violent crime, as well. ‘Papering’ a judge Lawyers intent on winning in the legal system – prosecutors and defense attorneys alike – routinely keep notes, either mentally or in private files, about the roster of judges and their tendencies. In the California state courts, lawyers in a given case are allowed one chance to disqualify a judge without providing a reason. The practice is known as “filing paper on a judge” or “papering a judge.” The risk, Brower said, is that you can get rid of one judge and get somebody worse. “If I paper this judge, where are they going to put me?” Brower asked rhetorically. “If you think you’re going to go to a worse place, don’t do it.” Years ago, when Superior Court Judge Byron McMillan ran the county’s main courthouse, the roster of principal trial judges was about split: “Half a dozen were regarded as more liberal, lenient, and half a dozen were regarded as more conservative or severe,” Brower said. McMillan made sure that any lawyer who papered a judge and appeared to be judge-shopping was sent to the courtroom where he least wanted to go. “You didn’t fool around with his assignments,” Brower said. Papering a judge is relatively uncommon and the District Attorney’s Office accepted its assignment to Goethals when the Dekraai mass-murder case entered the system after the 2011 shooting rampage. 100 hours of tape  Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas Despite overwhelming evidence that Dekraai had committed the crimes, authorities covertly recorded more than 100 hours of conversations between the defendant and a jailhouse informant – a tactic they chose to pursue even in a seemingly slam-dunk case because of expected legal jousting over Dekraai’s sanity and whether he should be given the death penalty, D.A. officials said. Dekraai never filed an insanity defense and he pleaded guilty to the murder charges, meaning the only legal issue not yet settled is whether he should be put to death or sentenced to life in prison. “In theory, O.J. was a slam-dunk case,” said Susan Kang Schroeder, the D.A.’s chief of staff, citing the murder acquittal of O.J. Simpson in justifying the decision to tape record Dekraai in jail. “There’s no such thing as a slam-dunk case. You can’t leave any stone unturned.” During the penalty phase of a trial, “anything and everything the defense wants to put on can be put on,” said Jim Tanizaki, senior assistant D.A. in charge of violent crimes. Prosecutors seek to be equally well-prepared in arguing the other side, he said. The use of jailhouse informants, long a tool in probing the insular culture of violent gangs and organized crime, is so fraught with risks to justice that California has enacted safeguards against abuses. Informants are supposed to glean only what a suspect volunteers. A 505-page motion  Scott Sanders Sanders, the public defender representing Dekraai, suspected it was more than a coincidence that a regular informant ended up in a cell next to the defendant. Fernando Perez, the jail inmate who helped authorities tape Dekraai, was a Mexican Mafia leader facing a third-strike life sentence for illegal possession of a firearm, Sanders said. Convicted in 2009, Perez was awaiting his sentencing – he still has not been sentenced – when he agreed to become a snitch in the summer of 2010, Sanders said. Through legal discovery, Sanders was able to obtain “a couple hundred pages” of notes, he said, showing that Perez worked virtually full-time helping law enforcement officials to collect information to bolster cases against dozens of defendants. “He literally wrote down stuff every day,” Sanders said. “He was working off his life sentence.” Sanders sought to show a pattern by jailers of moving informants around and concealing a secret database of snitches that were part of an evidence-gathering network. His motion, first filed in January 2014, consisted of 505 pages, plus 15,000 pages of related exhibits. He accused authorities of “shocking misconduct” and an all-out push to obtain the death penalty against Dekraai. Goethals not only read the massive filing; he initiated a series of hearings that began in March of 2014. Goethals at first refused to remove the D.A.’s office from the case, although he ruled in August that evidence-gathering “errors” committed by authorities reached “the level of misconduct.” He barred them from using the tapes against Dekraai. Subsequently, Sanders was able to show that jailers kept logs detailing the movement of prisoners and the reasons they were moved – records which, in theory, would track the placement of informants. Such records, known as TREDS, were routinely withheld from defense attorneys and, until Sanders introduced them into the courtroom, were never mentioned during the hearings by some of the Sheriff’s deputies assigned to moving inmates. When Goethals reversed course and decided in March of this year to remove the D.A.’s office from prosecuting the penalty case, the judge singled out two sheriff’s deputies whom he said “have either intentionally lied or willfully withheld material evidence from this court.” Goethals’ written ruling also made note of the district attorney’s responsibility for the actions of law enforcement agents working for prosecutors. Some of “those agents have habitually ignored the law over an extended period of time,” the judge wrote, concluding that “the District Attorney’s continued participation in this prosecution will likely prevent this defendant from receiving a fair trial in the future.” An unintended consequence of Goethals’ action is further delay in a trial that has dragged on more than three years already. It could take another year, attorneys estimated, to settle the legal appeal of the district attorney’s ouster. Grieving families of the victims were already imploring Goethals in the summer of 2013 to get the case over with – and the judge, while voicing sympathy, postponed a trial date for nearly half a year to give more time to the defense. The inquiry into the tapes stretched on for an additional year. ‘Bad on sex cases’  Susan Kang Schroeder, the D.A.’s chief of staff Throughout 2014 and early 2015, lawyers in the D.A.’s office filed paper to divert more than 50 unrelated cases away from Goethals’ courtroom. Schroeder, the D.A.’s chief of staff, denied that prosecutors were boycotting Goethals because of mounting frustrations in the Dekraai case. Rather, she said, certain prosecuting attorneys felt that Goethals was “bad on sex cases.” If the charge was sexual assault, Goethals was reluctant to admit evidence involving prior acts that might show a propensity for such behavior. “He would never let it in – or rarely let it in,” Schroeder said. Similarly, Goethals was tough on prosecutors in some types of gang cases, Schroeder said. In a bank robbery, for example, if a shooting occurs, prosecutors would like to advance the argument that “killing someone is natural probable consequence of robbing a bank,” she said. Goethals was apt to keep out theories that might have a prejudicial effect on a jury, she said. “As attorneys, we’ll do ‘turkey shooting’ – get together and say, ‘The facts are X, Y and Z – how would you get that admitted?’” Schroeder said. Papering a judge is just part of that normal process, she said. “They’re trying to get the best results on their case. We’ve had, in the past, female D.A.s refuse to go to a certain judge because he would be unfair to female attorneys. “To say that our office has singled out Judge Goethals, it’s just not true,” Schroeder said. Nonetheless, in March, when the state Attorney General’s office announced it would appeal the D.A.’s removal from the Dekraai matter, Rackauckas instructed his lawyers to file paper on Goethals only if they could justify avoiding his courtroom, Schroeder said. Experts from throughout the country have chimed in on the subject of jailhouse snitches, who were a factor in nearly half of the known 111 wrongful convictions in capital murder cases in the United States since the 1970s, according to the Northwestern University Law School’s Center on Wrongful Convictions. “The whole concept of jailhouse informants defies credibility,” Radley Balko, author of “Rise of the Warrior Cop: the Militarization of America’s Police Force,” wrote in a column in the Washington Post. “The very idea that people regularly confess to crimes that could put them in prison for decades or possibly even get them executed to someone they just met in a jail cell and have known for all of a few hours is and has always been preposterous.” Would-be critics of Goethals are in the difficult position of being loathe to speak – partly because of the looming litigation, and partly because few lawyers would dare criticize a judge who might soon hear their own cases. Sleeps like a rock Goethals’ admirers are more forthcoming. Newport Beach attorney Kate Corrigan, former head of the Orange County Criminal Defense Bar Association, said prosecutors underestimated Goethals by assuming he would “rubber stamp” the results they wanted. “Judge Goethals showed he takes his oath seriously,” Corrigan said. “He has an amazing moral compass … and he is not going to put up with Constitutional violations of anyone’s rights, whether he’s a gang member or accused of capital murder. “I’m confident he sleeps like a rock and his conscience is clear because he’s done the right thing,” Corrigan said, “and he knows he’s done the right thing.” Patty Goethals said it’s true – he sleeps soundly, though the intensity of the flak troubled him. “It was difficult at first,” she said. “Tom worked for the D.A.’s office for many years and he loves the D.A.’s office.” He found some solace in emails from friends and supportive letters to the editor, which he would clip from the newspaper. He has always been good at leaving the job behind at the end of the day, his wife said. He sits and enjoys a glass of red wine, reading the paper while she cooks dinner. Goethals enjoys tranquil moments tending his rose garden – “Tom’s passionate about gardening; he’s got a beautiful rose garden,” his wife said – and he has much to look forward to in the months ahead, including the arrival of a second grandchild. The Goethals are forgoing their summer trip to the lake to attend seven weddings – most of which Goethals will officiate himself, Patty said. “If they’re good family friends, he likes to do it.” Contact the writer: dferrell@coastmagazine.com Get the latest news delivered daily!

South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, tapped by the Republican Party to deliver their rebuttal to Barack Obama's State of the Union address, dutifully hit several conservative talking points against the Democratic president and liberal policies. She also presented her inspiring life story: she’s the daughter of Indian immigrants who rose to the governorship, and led South Carolina through the aftermath of a horrifying mass shooting by removing the confederate battle flag from the state house. For all of these reasons, rumor has it that she’s quite the desirable vice presidential candidate in 2016. But with this line at the end of the speech, she might not be a good veep candidate for Donald Trump: “In many parts of society today, whether in popular culture, academia, the media, or politics, there’s a tendency to falsely equate noise with results. Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference. That is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.” Given the Republic National Committee gave Haley the gig, it’s pretty clear that the G.O.P. is still not sold on this Trump presidency. And given the glowing response to her speech from both sides of the aisle, they might have some tiny flicker of hope.

186,http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2610477-hakeem-olajuwon-comments-on-donald-trumps-presidential-campaign," Donald Trump is in the middle of a 2016 presidential run, but former Houston Rockets superstar Hakeem Olajuwon is certainly not in his corner. According to Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle, the Hall of Famer spoke out against Trump’s stance on Muslims entering the United States. Feigen noted Olajuwon is a “devout Muslim” and pointed out Trump “issued a written statement in the days following a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, in which he announced ‘Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.’” The presidential candidate “has since maintained that position in speeches and interviews.” Olajuwon offered his analysis on Trump's stance, per Feigen: First of all, it’s amazing to see how many people came out to disregard that kind of stand, even internationally. That kind of statement is not worthy of a president. I don’t think it was too wise a statement. It is a complex question. It is something so complex and that just gave it a generic answer to a complex question. ... I do not believe that we have come this far that that kind of statement would come out when discussing that kind of issue today. I think we passed that a long time ago. Olajuwon himself is a naturalized United States citizen who immigrated from Nigeria in 1980. He became a United States citizen in 1993 and went on to play for the U.S. men's Olympic team in 1996. Feigen said the big man splits time between London, where one of his daughters goes to school, and Houston, where he will work with Rockets bigs the rest of the season. Olajuwon played 17 seasons for the Rockets after the team drafted him No. 1 overall in 1984 and was an integral part of the franchise’s back-to-back championship teams in 1993-94 and 1994-95.

187,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/yyejhDeWXTc/the-best-columns-of-2015.html,"SEARCH The Daily Beast picks the top offerings by the nation’s columnists, from Frank Bruni’s keen deconstruction of Trump to Ben Boychuck’s lamentation of the American educational system. Every year, we catalogue the best columns of the past 12 months here at The Daily Beast. It’s a necessarily subjective selection process, though we crowd-source nominations. Our credibility as judges comes from editing (with our friend Jesse Angelo) two Deadline Artists anthologies of America’s greatest newspaper columns. In the past, we’ve left columnists from The Daily Beast off this list in an attempt cast a wider net. But the shooting at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College inspired some true deadline artistry from The Beast’s Mike Daly and Goldie Taylor. In the hours after the shooting, Daly seized on the story of U.S. Army vet Chris Mintz, who charged the shooter in an attempt to save others on his son’s 6th birthday. His column created the mantra “Forget the Zero; Remember the Hero.” Goldie Taylor’s take on the mass shooting was more personal: a look back at her father and brother’s death by gun violence, in “Nine Families Are Getting the Same Call I Did.” Together, those two columns reached more than 5 million readers, showing once more that great columns resonate because they help make sense of sometimes horrific current events. They remind us that we are not alone. But the biggest game often comes with campaigns, and the surreal spectacle of 2015’s warm-up year provided peak columnist fodder. As candidates for president began haunting the nation’s diners, town halls and debate podiums, the best columnists took out sharp pencils and began wielding them like stilettos, cutting through the fog of hot air spewing from puffed-up politicians. Frank Bruni aimed high and low, taking on Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and Gov. Scott Walker, whose poor polling numbers led him to quit the race early. In “Trump-ward Christian Soldiers?” Bruni chides professedly pious voters for supporting a bombastic, thrice-married billionaire who “just about runs the table on the seven deadly sins. He personifies greed, embodies pride, radiates lust. Wrath is covered by his anti-immigrant, anti-“losers” rants, and if we interpret gluttony to include big buildings and not just Big Macs, he’s a glutton through and through.” Walker’s campaign collapsed and he departed stage right, but not without a farewell kick from Bruni in “Scott Walker’s Cocktail of Ignorance.” “His best gaffes were still to come, though he gave us several gems,” writes Bruni. He extended the critique to the public as well as a single flailing politician, “Well beyond the Republican primary and the Republican Party, we’ve exhibited a curious habit in this country of forgiving intellectual blind spots and refashioning a contempt for schooling as an embrace of common sense.” Over at Commentary, Pete Wehner has been fighting an often lonely fight to connect the soul of the conservative movement with civility in the face of Trump & Co. In a series of columns, sometimes running in the NY Times and the Financial Times, he took on Trumpism early and often, accurately accounting for his rise as the product of certain intellectual and political habits that have “taken hold over the years: a lazy anti-government ideology, prizing emotivism over empiricism, and conflict in pursuit of lost causes.” Wehner thoughtfully skewers the latest emergence of the Know-Nothing populism by calling on the better angels of our nature. To Wehner, conservatism “isn’t dogmatic, inflexible or utopian, believing as it does in the fallen nature of human beings and the importance of human experience.” Wehner is an elegant thinker who brings historic and theological perspective to his columns. His persistent calls for bringing civility, principled compromise and perspective to our politics makes him a much-needed voice for Republicans right now. Gov. Chris Christie got slammed to the turf in the journalistic equivalent of a quarterback sack by the estimable Tom Moran of the Star-Ledger in a column under the ominous title: “After 14 years of watching Christie, a warning: He Lies.” “Other lying politicians tend to waffle, to leave themselves some escape hatch. You can almost smell it,” writes Moran, before listing a series of serious whoppers by the man who would be president. “But Christie lies with conviction. His hands don't shake, and his eyes don't wander.” Ouch. In the U.K., the Labour Party has been going through the mirror image of the GOP’s travails, with new leader Jeremy Corbyn (think Bernie Sanders on ideological steroids) purging the center-left that brought the party to three consecutive election wins for the first time in its history under Tony Blair. One of the most persuasive push-backs came from a former Marxist, Jonathan Jones, who reflected back on his visit to the Soviet Union, when he said goodbye to all that. “I am a Labour centrist supporter not out of cynicism but out of principle,” Jones wrote in The Guardian, “because I believe the only ethical politics of the left today has to be moderate, reasoning, and skeptical.” Away from the political scrum, a pair of top California columnists, acting as street anthropologists, discover and expose American tribes engaged in the worst kind of ignorance and excess. In “Kardashian wannabes party hard and do what they want in the Hollywood Hills,” the great Steve Lopez walks through the front door of an opulent mansion where rich hedonists pay $34,000 a month—and along the way, generate enough noise, garish lighting, traffic and jammed-up streets that the ordinary folk are up in arms. Lopez gets one of the developers behind the controversy to go on the record with this sensitive advice to his neighbors: “Get out of Hollywood. They don’t belong there.... [Blank] those people. I don’t care about them.” And in “It’s Pathetic that We Don’t Know Sikhs from Muslims,” the Sacramento Bee’s Ben Boychuk gives a scathing, anguished account of the accusations, hassles, and physical violence inflicted on turban-wearing members of the Sikh faith, mistakenly believed to be possible Muslim terrorists by ignorant security guards. “Good judgment has become a commodity as rare as wisdom,” thunders Boychuk. “The security guards at Qualcomm might say better safe than sorry, and a lot of people would agree. Better smart than stupid, I say.” The Daily News’ Harry Siegel saved his best for last this year, getting in under the gun with a New Year’s Eve column on his doomed love affair with smoking cigarettes. “It’s time to say goodbye to my oldest, dearest companion, the one that’s been with me for much longer than my wife, let alone my kids. The one that was with me when I felt as new as the sunrise, when I felt as old as the Earth, when I was high as a lord looking down on my city, when I was as low as the sea washing up on it.” An outlier on this list is Walter Isaacson, who left day-to-day journalism a long time ago.  But the celebrated biographer and CEO of the Aspen Institute took a poetic spin in the Sunday Times this year with ""Walker Percy's Theory of Hurricanes"" to mark the 10th anniversary of Katrina. The NOLA native wove disparate threads together to ruminate on the unity of purpose that can come from tragedy. “’Why is a man apt to feel bad in a good environment, say suburban Short Hills, N.J., on an ordinary Wednesday afternoon?’ Percy wrote in one of his essays. ‘Why is the same man apt to feel good in a very bad environment, say an old hotel on Key Largo during a hurricane?’ Part of the answer is that when a hurricane is about to hit, we no longer feel uncertain about our role in the world. Everyone is focused, connected, engaged…There’s an edgy creativity that comes from the shared aftertaste of danger, a sense of community that comes from knowing you’re in the same boat.” We’ll close out the Deadline Artist Class of ’15 with another Beast: Ana Marie Cox, who sparked conversation that scrambled partisan assumptions with her testimony of faith in “Why I'm Coming Out as Christian.” “I have not been public about my faith. I am somewhat tempted to embrace the punk-rockness of being a progressive, feminist, tattooed, pro-choice, graduate-educated believer—and then I have to remind myself that believing in God is about as punk rock as wearing pants, maybe even less so.” With disarming honesty and healthy doses of humor, Ana Marie took a risk of intimacy that was rewarded by readers. Honesty, humor, clarity, and courage are core parts of the columnist’s palette and the surreal spectacle of the still-unfolding campaign seems to ensure that the reported column renaissance will continue in 2016.",2016-01-03 07:47:00,The Best Columns of 2015,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

By JEREMY HERB 01/06/2016 08:30 AM EST Presented by With Austin Wright BULLETIN — NORTH KOREA SAYS IT'S TESTED HYDROGEN BOMB: North Korea said Tuesday it had successfully conducted its first hydrogen bomb test. If so, it would be a significant step up from Pyongyang’s previous three nuclear tests, the last in 2013. More
here from The New York Times: “The assertion, if true, would dramatically escalate the nuclear challenge from one of the world’s most isolated and dangerous states. “In an announcement, North Korea said that the test had been a ‘complete success.’ But it was difficult to tell whether the statement was true. North Korea has made repeated claims about its nuclear capabilities that outside analysts have greeted with skepticism. ‘This is the self-defensive measure we have to take to defend our right to live in the face of the nuclear threats and blackmail by the United States and to guarantee the security of the Korean Peninsula,’ a female North Korean announcer said, reading the statement on Central Television, the state-run network. “The North’s announcement came about an hour after detection devices around the world had picked up a 5.1 seismic event along the country’s northeast coast. It may be weeks or longer before detectors sent aloft by the United States and other powers can determine what kind of test was conducted.” — U.S., OTHERS ACROSS GLOBE CONDEMN TEST: State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement late Tuesday: “While we cannot confirm these claims at this time, we condemn any violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions and again call on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments.” In China, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said both Britain and China support a return to the six-party nuclear talks, according to
Reuters. And French President Francois Hollande
called for a ""strong reaction from the international community.” — RUBIO BLASTS OBAMA AFTER TEST (AND LOOK FOR OTHERS TO FOLLOW TODAY),
via POLITICO’s Hanna Trudo: “Sen. Marco Rubio ripped into President Barack Obama late Tuesday night after North Korea claimed it had conducted the successful test of a hydrogen bomb. ""I have been warning throughout this campaign that North Korea is run by a lunatic who has been expanding his nuclear arsenal while President Obama has stood idly by,"" the Florida senator and Republican presidential candidate said in a statement. “If this test is confirmed, it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy,"" — WHAT TRUMP WILL BE SAYING TODAY: GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump may not have the most nuanced response today to North Korea’s nuclear test, but expect him to point back to his comments in a September debate that he saw this coming: “Nobody ever mentions North Korea, where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons ... Somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places,” Trump said at the
September CNN debate. HAPPY WEDNESDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we’re always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback. Email us at

WAR REPORT, AFGHANISTAN EDITION — ONE U.S. TROOP KILLED, TWO WOUNDED: A U.S. service member was killed and two more wounded in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday, in the latest instance where U.S. troops are still very involved with the fight there, even if the official U.S. combat mission has ended. The Associated Press has more
here: “The fighting, which reflects intensified efforts by the U.S. and its Afghan partners to push back against Taliban gains, was near the city of Marja, Helmand province, which shares a border with Pakistan. “Details on the battle were sketchy. ‘There is still a fight going on,’ Pentagon Secretary Peter Cook said hours after the casualties were sustained. ‘We don't yet have all the details surrounding what has taken place.’ … Cook said two U.S. helicopters were dispatched to the scene to provide medical evacuation for the U.S. casualties but could not complete the mission. One was waved off after taking fire and returned safely to its base, he said. The other landed safely but was unable to take off because its rotor struck a wall.” WAR REPORT, ISIL EDITION — ISLAMIC STATE HAS LOST 30 PERCENT OF ITS TERRITORY, according to the U.S.-led coalition, also
via the AP: “The U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group said Tuesday that the militants have lost 30 percent of the territory they once held in Iraq and Syria. Baghdad-based spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters the extremists have lost 40 percent of their territory in Iraq and 20 percent in Syria, adding that they are now in a ‘defensive crouch.’ “Since the U.S.-led coalition began launching airstrikes in 2014, Kurdish forces have pushed IS out of parts of northern Iraq, including the town of Sinjar, and driven the extremists out of a band of Syrian territory along the Turkish border. Further south, Iraqi forces and Shiite militias recaptured the Iraqi city of Tikrit last year.” — SPIN ALERT: Warren’s comments about the Islamic State losing 30 percent of its territory mark a change in the Obama administration’s language. Last month, President Barack Obama said in an
NPR interview that ISIL had lost 40 percent of its
populated territory, which of course is a different measurement. The word populated was absent from Warren’s remarks on Tuesday. FOR YOUR RADAR — TUESDAY’S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, BEFORE AND AFTER: Yes, the president’s final State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress will be the main attraction next week, but there’ll be events before and after on the national security front: — VICKERS, MORRELL TO TESTIFY ON ISLAMIC STATE: The morning of the State of the Union, two former Obama intelligence officials are testifying on the U.S. strategy against the Islamic State: former Acting CIA Director Michael Morell and former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers. The pair, testifying with former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford, could provide fodder for Obama’s critics from top former administration officials ahead of the speech that will surely offer a bullish take on the ISIL campaign. — HALEY TO OFFER GOP REBUTTAL: Get your vice presidential prognostications ready: South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is
delivering the Republican rebuttal to the State of the Union, GOP congressional leaders announced Tuesday. — THORNBERRY SPEAKING AT THE PRESS CLUB: House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry will have the chance to offer his own State of the Union rebuttal, as the Texas Republican is speaking at the National Press Club Wednesday, Jan. 13, the day after Obama’s address. It’s not the first time Thornberry’s scheduled a speech near the State of the Union: He
spoke at the American Enterprise Institute the morning of last year’s address. NAVY CHIEF ISSUES NEW STRATEGIC GUIDANCE: On Tuesday, Richardson released new high-level
strategic guidance for the Navy that calls for it to adapt to rapid advances in technology, to a maritime system that’s “more contested than ever before” and to a budget crunch that’s not likely to let up. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” said Richardson, who’s been in his post since September. CAN U.S. CALM IRAN, SAUDI TENSIONS? KERRY IS WORKING THE PHONES, 
reports our colleague Nahal Toosi: “Secretary of State John Kerry, determined to stop a Saudi-Iran break in diplomatic ties from scuttling the Syrian peace process, is reaching out to leaders across the Middle East to press for calm. The State Department said that Kerry had, since Sunday, talked at least twice to Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, as well as Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “The U.S. efforts — as well as appeals by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and other international leaders — appear to be yielding some positive results. Al-Jubeir, who announced Sunday that Riyadh was severing diplomatic relations with Iran,
signaled Tuesday that the Saudis would not pull out of the Syria talks, according to media reports.” BUDGET WATCH — PENTAGON TO SUBMIT NEW BUDGET TO OMB NEXT WEEK: The Pentagon is expected next week to submit its budget request for fiscal 2017 to the White House Office of Management and Budget, one of the final steps ahead of the administration’s rollout of its annual budget blueprint. The blueprint is due to Congress the first Monday in February, but the Obama administration has been late in the past. In November, Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work had
said the goal was to get the defense budget proposal to OMB this week. But a Pentagon official today said the budget was not yet complete. “The final budget numbers have not been locked and continue to be worked,” the official told POLITICO, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “While we expect PB17 to be submitted to Congress on time, OMB has not yet released the official date.” MAKING MOVES — VOTEL TO BE PICKED AS NEW CENTCOM CHIEF, 
reports The Wall Street Journal’s Gordon Lubold: “President Barack Obama will nominate an Army special operations officer to lead U.S. Central Command and oversee the missions in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, according to Pentagon officials in Washington. The officials said that Mr. Obama intends to nominate Gen. Joe Votel, currently the head of U.S. Special Operations Command, to become chief of Centcom, the war command in Tampa, Fla., that oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East.” — CSBA NAMES NEW FELLOW ON DEFENSE BUDGET: Katherine Blakeley is joining the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments as a research fellow focusing on the defense budget, the think tank announced Tuesday.

LOCATION: Charleston, South Carolina DEMOCRATIC DEBATE PARTICIPANTS: Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont MODERATOR: Lester Holt, weekday anchor of NBC Nightly News and anchor for Dateline NBC. LATEST BEFORE THE DEBATE: On the eve of the next Democratic debate, Sanders announced his support for legislation that would reverse a 2005 law granting gun manufacturers legal immunity that he once supported. Sanders' changed position came after days of attacks from Clinton, who had attempted to use his previous vote to undercut his liberal image. The two candidates, along with O'Malley, meet Sunday for the last debate before voting begins in the Iowa caucuses -- a match-up that's expected to be far more contentious than their previous three forums. The debate was scheduled to take place just blocks from the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where nine parishioners were killed in a mass shooting last summer. Gun control has emerged as a central theme in the race, with Clinton citing it as one of the major differences between the candidates. The former secretary of state is fighting to regain her lead in the race, with polls show Sanders gaining traction in Iowa and New Hampshire. South Carolina, fourth in line with its primary contest, is seen as a possible firewall for the Clinton campaign because of its strength among minority voters, who make up a sizable portion of the electorate in the state.

193,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/YwmSfIh843k/ct-obama-gun-control-executive-actions-20160104-story.html,"WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama is slated Monday to finalize a set of new executive actions tightening the nation's gun laws, making his first order of business in 2016 a clear signal the president in his final year doesn't intend to go quietly. At a meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey and other top law enforcement officials Obama is expected to sign off on a package of proposals aimed at curbing gun violence and cracking down on unregulated gun sales. At the top of the list is an effort to expand background checks on gun sales by forcing more sellers to register as federally licensed gun dealers. The changes would be aimed at some unregistered sellers who skirt the background check laws by selling at gun shows, online or informal settings. President Obama to hold CNN town hall on guns Thursday Other moves being considered include improving reporting of lost and stolen weapons and beefing up inspections of licensed dealers, according to a person familiar with the plans who would not be named discussing proposals before they are finalized. The package includes measures this White House has long considered but not completed, mindful of the legal fight sure to follow as well as the potential for political backlash for some fellow Democrats. But after a steady string of mass shootings and with the clock on his tenure ticking down, Obama appears primed to push further than he has in the past. ""We definitely think there are things he can do,"" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for expanding background checks. Gross says his recent conversations with White House aides have left him hopeful. ""It's very clear that the White House is feeling emboldened,"" he said. Even before the president's formal announcement, Republicans were registering their opposition. ""The president is at minimum subverting the legislative branch, and potentially overturning its will,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., said in a statement Monday. Obama eyes executive action to expand background checks for gun buyers Obama announced the meeting with Lynch in his weekly address from his Hawaii holiday vacation. On Thursday, he'll take his argument to prime time, participating in a town hall discussion of gun violence on CNN. He's slated to make his case for changes in his State of the Union address on Jan. 12. The high-profile rollout reflects a White House continuing to look for ways to wrap up unfinished business, despite an uncooperative Congress. After all but ignoring the issue in his first term, Obama changed course after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012. Nevertheless, the president failed to push a package of gun measures through Congress, including one expanding background checks. At the same time, Obama took nearly two dozen executive actions to tighten gun laws, but left a major expansion of background checks out of the mix. But after the shooting at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon in October, a weary and angry Obama ordered his staff to redouble the effort to look for ways to work around Congress. Under current law, federally licensed firearms dealers are required to seek background checks on potential firearm purchasers. But advocacy groups say many sellers are currently exempt from having to register, increasing the chance of sales to customers prohibited by law from purchasing a gun. The administration is expected to reclassify some of those dealers using a mix of criteria, such as the number and frequency of guns sold, whether sellers profit off sales, whether they advertise, rent space or tables at gun shows and pay taxes. White House officials have not yet disclosed the details of the proposal. Reid: Democrats 'maybe' to blame on gun bill losses Obama's plans immediately set off a political debate on the presidential campaign trail, both over the policy and whether the president has the authority to make it. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who has already proposed an executive action to close the gun show loophole, cheered Obama's plans. ""I am absolutely convinced we can have gun safety measures consistent with the Constitution,"" she said during a presidential campaign event in Concord, New Hampshire. ""I will take on that fight. I'm very hopeful and excited that the president is going to take some action with executive action in the next week or two ... but if it's a Republican who walks into the White House within the first day, the executive orders will be reversed."" Rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, told ABC's ""This Week"" he wished Congress could find consensus but added the move was the ""right thing to do."" Republicans candidates rejected the proposals, including those who have backed some gun control measures in the past. ""This president is a petulant child,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Sunday on ""Fox News Sunday."" ''The fact is if he wants to make changes to these laws, go to Congress and convince the Congress that they're necessary. But this is going to be another illegal executive action which I'm sure will be rejected by the courts."" ""I don't like changing anything,"" Donald Trump said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ''Right now, they have plenty of rules and regulations.""

But what, you ask (and I’m glad you did), does 10,000 characters look like? Well, hey. Let’s find out. Soooo, did you see the Warriors game last night? Crazy, right? It was nice to see Harrison Barnes back and the entire crowd cheered when he entered the game. Steph Curry is probably not human, because he shoots the ball from the parking lot and it swishes like butter. How many characters am I up to now? Lemme check, so hold on…. 597. Anyways, then it started raining today and my dogs don’t like rain so it’s really difficult to take them outside to do their business in the morning when they don’t want to deal with the rain. I try to talk them into the fact that they’re actually getting a bath and pooping at the same time, kind of a two birds with one stone thing. They don’t buy it. Speaking of rain, it didn’t rain on my wedding day like the weather people thought it would. How do they keep their jobs when they’re wrong all of the time? It’s almost like they could do my job. Wait, I didn’t mean that how it sounded. Where are we at now? 1194. OK. So anyways. Here’s a favorite quote of mine from Bill Clinton: If you live long enough, you’ll make mistakes. But if you learn from them, you’ll be a better person. It’s how you handle adversity, not how it affects you. The main thing is never quit, never quit, never quit. I think what he’s saying is that you can make mistakes, but you have to learn from them. I’ve made a bunch of mistakes, how about you? My dogs made a mistake this morning because they didn’t want to go out in the rain. But that’s cool, I don’t get mad. Life’s too short, you know? Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit.

Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. Never quit. 2507. Did you see the President speak about gun control today? It’s important. Probably the most important problem of our time and we have to solve it. Here’s what he said today: THE PRESIDENT: Happy New Year, everybody. Before the New Year, I mentioned that I had given the charge to my Attorney General, FBI Director, Deputy Director at the ATF, and personnel at my White House to work together to see what more we could do to prevent a scourge of gun violence in this country. I think everybody here is all too familiar with the statistics. We have tens of thousands of people every single year who are killed by guns. We have suicides that are committed by firearms at a rate that far exceeds other countries. We have a frequency of mass shootings that far exceeds other countries in frequency. And although it is my strong belief that for us to get our complete arm around the problem Congress needs to act, what I asked my team to do is to see what more we could do to strengthen our enforcement and prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands to make sure that criminals, people who are mentally unstable, those who could pose a danger to themselves or others are less likely to get them. And I’ve just received back a report from Attorney General Lynch, Director Comey, as well as Deputy Director Brandon about some of the ideas and initiatives that they think can make a difference. And the good news is, is that these are not only recommendations that are well within my legal authority and the executive branch, but they’re also ones that the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners, support and believe. So over the next several days, we’ll be rolling out these initiatives. We’ll be making sure that people have a very clear understanding of what can make a difference and what we can do. And although we have to be very clear that this is not going to solve every violent crime in this country, it’s not going to prevent every mass shooting, it’s not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal, it will potentially save lives and spare families the pain and the extraordinary loss that they’ve suffered as a consequence of a firearm getting in the hands of the wrong people. I’m also confident that the recommendations that are being made by my team here are ones that are entirely consistent with the Second Amendment and people’s lawful right to bear arms. And we’ve been very careful recognizing that, although we have a strong tradition of gun ownership in this country, that even though it’s who possess firearms for hunting, for self-protection, and for other legitimate reasons, I want to make sure that the wrong people don’t have them for the wrong reasons. So I want to say how much I appreciate the outstanding work that the team has done. Many of you worked over the holidays to get this set of recommendations to me. And I’m looking forward to speaking to the American people over the next several days in more detail about it. Thank you very much, everybody. Regardless of where you stand on the matter, we have to change some things. Back to tech. Are you at CES? I’m not this year. Mostly because there’s a lot of germs and I shouldn’t be around them if I can help it. I’m pretty sure my dogs would have liked it though, because there’s a lot of tech in Vegas for all kinds of people (and pets). If you were a dog would you want a phone? Or a self-feeding thing? Of course you would. You’d have to sit around all day watching your parents use technology while you sit around and lick yourself. What kind of existence is that? I know, right? I hope there’s some dog tech that comes out of the conference, otherwise it’s a wash. 6294. Time for another quote. JFK this time: When written in Chinese, the word ‘crisis’ is composed of two characters. One represents danger and the other represents opportunity. I think what JFK meant was just because things aren’t going your way doesn’t mean that it won’t eventually. You have to play the long game, you have to stick in there and see things as far as you can possibly see them. It’s like Twitter. People are worried about whether Twitter can weather the storm of lack of growth. I think it can. What about the character count? Well, I personally feel like asking people to keep their thoughts shorter make them more powerful. They’re easier to share. Repeat, etc. What will happen when people can put this much text in a tweet? I don’t know. I do know that I don’t want to spend hours reading tweets because I like the fact that I can glance at the app and figure out what’s going on pretty quickly. If I wanted to write a book, I’d do it on Facebook. But maybe people want more characters. I’m not sure who, though. I’d like to meet them. Maybe they have dogs, too. We could chat about that. What are your favorite movies? I have a top 10 and it changes sometimes: – Rocky

Here’s another quote, this time from Maya Angelou: The thing to do, it seems to me, is to prepare yourself so you can be a rainbow in somebody else’s cloud. Somebody who may not look like you. May not call God the same name you call God – if they call God at all. I may not dance your dances or speak your language. But be a blessing to somebody. That’s what I think. Being a blessing to someone is a great way to be. Have you been a blessing to someone lately? I feel like we could all do a better job of that, even if it’s in small ways. I feel like people always want to do something great and massively huge, but forget about all of the little things along the way. Making someone smile, holding the door for someone, giving someone a hug when they really really need it. Those kinds of things last forever. Don’t hold back on doing a bunch of little great things to do something huge that you’ll get overwhelmed with and not follow through on. 8614. Wow, this is a lot of characters. I feel like Kurt Wagner did a good job of talking about the ramifications of expanding tweets to 10,000 characters: The design aspect is key. Making Tweets bigger by adding more content or bigger pictures has diminished user engagement in the past, according to one source. That makes sense. If tweets take a long time to consume or take up more space on your screen, it’s likely that you’ll view (and engage with) fewer of them. So Twitter is trying to add more content without disrupting the way you currently scroll through your timeline. How can Twitter become more like Facebook without becoming Facebook? There’s too many words on Facebook, something the company itself is trying to get away from by introducing all sorts of new media, like 360 degree videos. There’s always a place for long form content, and just because you have the space doesn’t mean you have to fill it. But still, a lot of people will try. Spammers will definitely try. In fact, can you imagine getting spam tweets that are over 140 characters? Ugh. It’ll be like reading SPAM in your EMAIL!@$#!@#!@# One more quote, this one from Clarence Darrow: When we fully understand the brevity of life, its fleeting joys and unavoidable pains; when we accept the facts that all men and women are approaching an inevitable doom: the consciousness of it should make us more kindly and considerate of each other. This feeling should make men and women use their best efforts to help their fellow travelers on the road, to make the path brighter and easier as we journey on. It should bring a closer kinship, a better understanding, and a deeper sympathy for the wayfarers who must live a common life and die a common death. Maybe Twitter should just acquire Medium instead.

The billionaire businessman and former Atlantic City casino icon announced that the commercial will begin airing Tuesday in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that host the nation's first presidential caucus and presidential primary, respectively. It is part of a series of ads that will air over the next month leading up to the Iowa caucus on Feb. 1 and the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, according to a report by the Washington Post. ""I am very proud of this ad,"" Trump said in a statement Monday. ""I don't know if I need it, but I don't want to take any chances because if I win we are going to Make America Great Again."" Though he launched his campaign in June, Trump went months without spending a penny on broadcast advertising because his incendiary comments, massive rallies and unexpected high poll numbers brought him endless media attention. The real estate mogul and former reality TV star didn't even release a radio ad until last month. But now, Trump has vowed to spend at least $2 million a week on TV ads as he fights U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for the top spot in Iowa. Trump trails Cruz by 3.6 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls. The businessman leads U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida by 13 percentage points in New Hampshire, followed close behind by Cruz and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The 30-second spot released Monday -- titled ""Great Again"" -- opens with a shot of President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state who is now the favorite for the Democratic nomination fore president. Soon, there is a montage of dramatic images: the suspects in the recent California mass shooting, people running across the border, members of the Islamic State terrorist group. A narrator then says Trump isn't afraid to blame ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and promotes the businessman's Muslim ban proposal, which critics say is unconstitutional but Trump says is needed to protect Americans. A screenshot of the first television add of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. ""That's why he's calling for a temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, until we can figure out what's going on,"" the narrator says. ""He'll quickly cut the head off ISIS and take their oil. And he'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for."" At the end is a clip of Trump saying his slogan at a rally: ""We will make America great again!"" Trump told the Post on Sunday that he has six to eight more ads in production. He also told the newspaper that he hopes to convince undecided voters the U.S. has become ""a dumping ground."" ""The world is laughing at us, at our stupidity,"" Trump told the Post. ""It's got to stop.""  Gallery: Top Donald Trump quotes of 2015 Brent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @johnsb01. Find NJ.com Politics on Facebook.

198,http://news.blogs.cnn.com/tag/cnns-doug-gross/,"Faced with a loud and angry backlash from some of its most active users, photo-sharing app Instagram backtracked Tuesday on new language that appeared to give the company ownership of their images. ""The language we proposed ... raised question about whether your photos can be part of an advertisement,"" Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom wrote in a blog post. ""We do not have plans for anything like this and because of that we're going to remove the language that raised the question."" Despite claims to the contrary, the Syrian government is almost certainly responsible for a blackout Thursday that shut down virtually all Internet service in the country, according to a leading Web security firm. ""The Syrian Minister of Information is being reported as saying that the government did not disable the Internet, but instead the outage was caused by a cable being cut,"" writes Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare. ""From our investigation, that appears unlikely to be the case."" Fighting again between rebels and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad disrupted much of Damascus on Friday, and there was no Internet service throughout much of Syria for a second straight day. The airport was closed to flights, and fighting killed another 31 people across the country on Friday, according to an opposition group that counts casualties. At least 12 people were killed and another 58 wounded when a gunman opened fire during an early Friday morning screening of the new Batman movie at an Aurora, Colorado, theater, Police Chief Dan Oates told reporters. (Earlier, police said 14 were dead and 38 wounded.) The heavily armed suspect has been identified as James Holmes, a 24-year-old Aurora resident who had been a doctoral student at the University of Colorado. He was arrested without putting up a fight at the theater moments after police arrived, Oates said. Chaos broke out during the showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" at the Century Aurora 16 theater when the shooting began, police and witnesses said. A man told CNN affiliate KUSA that people were confused when the shooting started because many believed the sound of gunfire was coming from the movie. According to Oates, Holmes' apartment housed a device with ""incendiary devices, some chemical elements linked together with all kinds of wires."" Below are running updates: (See full story | Photos) [Updated 11:00 p.m. ET] Some residents of Aurora, Colorado, gathered in community, prayer and faith late Friday to honor the victims of a shooting inside a local movie theater. ""Today, we came to pray. Today we came to heal,"" said Rhonda Fields, a Colorado state representative. ""This is a very sad situation. I don't know about you, but I'm shaken. We have 12 people that lost their lives just behind us ... I don't know what else to do but to pray,"" she said. Fields spoke at an evening vigil that brought together various faith leaders, and which was held near where the shooting took place. [Updated 9:43 p.m. ET] Twelve people are dead and 58 wounded following a mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater, police investigator Trevor Materasso told CNN by telephone Friday night. The toll given earlier by Police Chief Dan Oates during a press conference Friday night was incorrect, authorities said. [Updated 9:27 p.m. ET] Chad Weinman, CEO of TacticalGear.com of Chesterfield, Missouri, told CNN that he believed his firm sold items to shooting suspect James Holmes. The company checked its records after employees heard about the shooting and found a receipt matching Holmes' name and his Aurora, Colorado, address, Weinman said. The receipt showed that Holmes bought an $106.99 Blackhawk urban assault vest, a $52.99 Blackhawk Omega Elite triple pistol magazine, a $52.99 Blackhawk Omega Elite M16 magazine pouch, and a $77.99 Blackhawk Be-Wharned silver knife. With shipping costs, the total bill came to $306.99, according to a copy of the receipt provided to CNN. The firm sells equipment to military and police personnel - as well as weekend warriors, Weinman said. [Updated 9:24 p.m. ET] Authorities expect within the hour to have a complete list of casualties from the mass shooting at a movie theater and will begin the process of notifying families, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said.

At one point, the president began to cry as he recalled the tragic mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, which ultimately left 20 childrenÂ dead. Many were evidently touched by the president's public display of emotion -- but not everyone was impressed. Andrea Tantaros of Fox News even accused President Obama of faking his tears, suggesting he used ""raw onion"" to cry. On Wednesday night, Trevor Noah gave these naysayers a piece of his mind during what was arguably his most articulate and powerfulÂ segment since he began hosting ""The Daily Show."" Noah played a clip of the moment the president began to cry and said, Then, he showed a clip of Tantaros, among others, criticizing and taunting the president for getting emotional. This is where things got really good as Noah had some choice words for these individuals. He said, Indeed, while people may disagree with President Obama's approach to the issue of gun violence, it's fairly ridiculous and inhumane to mock him for crying about the deaths of innocent children. After all, even Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump defended the president in this regard. During a phone interview on ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday, Trump said, Trevor Noah's thoughts on the negative reactions to Obama's tears were spot on.

200,http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/01/watch_1st_tv_ad_of_donald_trumps_presidential_camp.html,"TRENTON -- Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Monday unveiled the first television ad of his campaign: a provocative clip that champions his controversial proposals to fight terrorism by temporarily banning Muslims from entering America and battle illegal immigration by building a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border. The billionaire businessman and former Atlantic City casino icon announced that the commercial will begin airing Tuesday in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that host the nation's first presidential caucus and presidential primary, respectively. It is part of a series of ads that will air over the next month leading up to the Iowa caucus on Feb. 1 and the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, according to a report by the Washington Post. ""I am very proud of this ad,"" Trump said in a statement Monday. ""I don't know if I need it, but I don't want to take any chances because if I win we are going to Make America Great Again."" Though he launched his campaign in June, Trump went months without spending a penny on broadcast advertising because his incendiary comments, massive rallies and unexpected high poll numbers brought him endless media attention. The real estate mogul and former reality TV star didn't even release a radio ad until last month. But now, Trump has vowed to spend at least $2 million a week on TV ads as he fights U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for the top spot in Iowa. Trump trails Cruz by 3.6 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls. The businessman leads U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida by 13 percentage points in New Hampshire, followed close behind by Cruz and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The 30-second spot released Monday -- titled ""Great Again"" -- opens with a shot of President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state who is now the favorite for the Democratic nomination fore president. Soon, there is a montage of dramatic images: the suspects in the recent California mass shooting, people running across the border, members of the Islamic State terrorist group. A narrator then says Trump isn't afraid to blame ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and promotes the businessman's Muslim ban proposal, which critics say is unconstitutional but Trump says is needed to protect Americans. A screenshot of the first television add of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. ""That's why he's calling for a temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, until we can figure out what's going on,"" the narrator says. ""He'll quickly cut the head off ISIS and take their oil. And he'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for."" At the end is a clip of Trump saying his slogan at a rally: ""We will make America great again!"" Trump told the Post on Sunday that he has six to eight more ads in production. He also told the newspaper that he hopes to convince undecided voters the U.S. has become ""a dumping ground."" ""The world is laughing at us, at our stupidity,"" Trump told the Post. ""It's got to stop.""  Gallery: Top Donald Trump quotes of 2015 Brent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @johnsb01. Find NJ.com Politics on Facebook.

202,http://www.ibtimes.com/chris-christie-gun-control-new-jersey-governor-admits-he-changed-stances-firearms-2254365,"While just weeks ago, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie denied supporting certain gun control measures in the 1990s, he is now conceding that he has changed his stance on guns since he entered New Jersey politics, Politico reported. The GOP presidential candidate has gone from proclaiming in 1995 that opposition to an assault weapons ban was “crazy” and “radical” to calling President Barack Obama a “petulant child” for taking executive actions this week to strengthen gun control. In a 1993 bid for the New Jersey state Senate, Christie said he was energized into running because of a Republican effort to repeal an assault weapons ban. When asked about it in November, Christie said it didn’t sound like him, NJ.com reported. “I was 32 years old and I’ve changed my mind,” Christie said Wednesday, according to Politico. “And the biggest reason that I changed my mind was my seven years as a federal prosecutor. What I learned in those seven years was that we were spending much too much time talking about gun laws against law-abiding citizens and not nearly enough time talking about enforcing the gun laws strongly against criminals.” Christie, who is running for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, bit into Obama’s gun control executive actions in advance Sunday, saying they would be overruled in the courts and that if elected president, he would reverse them, the Huffington Post reported. In 2013, Christie did sign a series of state gun control laws to address gun violence, but has since vetoed various gun control bills. After the 2012 slaughter at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 little children were killed, the Obama administration has stepped up its gun control efforts. Tuesday, Obama announced steps to expand background checks and create more stringent requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. .@ChrisChristie: Obama “is refusing to listen to the will of the American people, which is they reject his policies” pic.twitter.com/s3iML1iC6R ""The American people have rejected his agenda by turning both the House and the Senate over to the Republicans, and going from 21 governors when he came into office, to 31 Republican governors now,” Christine said, according to the Huffington Post. “Now this president wants to act as if he is a king, as if he is a dictator.""",2016-01-07 09:20:54,Chris Christie On Gun Control: New Jersey Governor Admits He Changed Stances On Firearms,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/
203,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/07/media-offers-helpful-suggestions-for-next-gun-control-actions/,"And by “helpful,” I mostly mean insane. The ephemeral nature of Barack Obama’s “actions” this week on gun control seems to have belatedly sunk into the national-media psyche, but common sense still appears in short supply. For instance, the Baltimore Sun’s Tricia Bishop wants the government to create a searchable online database so that parents can know which homes have firearms, in case their kids want to go play (via Twitchy): I’m less afraid of the criminals wielding guns in Baltimore, I declared as we discussed the issue, than I am by those permitted gun owners. I know how to stay out of the line of Baltimore’s illegal gunfire; I have the luxury of being white and middle class in a largely segregated city that reserves most of its shootings for poor, black neighborhoods overtaken by “the game.” The closest I typically get to the action is feeling the chest-thumping vibrations of the Foxtrot police helicopter flying overhead in pursuit of someone who might be a few streets over, but might as well be a world away. But I don’t know where the legal gun owners are or how to ensure that their children, no matter how well versed in respecting firearms, won’t one day introduce that weapon to my daughter. And so, as President Barack Obama announced plans this week to tighten background checks for gun buyers and increase gun tracking and research, I thought, that’s all well and good, but how about adding something immediately useful: a gun owner registry available to the public online — something like those for sex offenders. I’m not equating gun owners with predatory perverts, but the model is helpful here; I want a searchable database I can consult to find out whether my kid can have a play date at your house. Well, here’s a thought that seems to have eluded this Responsible Parent: Why not ask? Or does Helicopter Mom just let her kids play in other people’s houses without at least first engaging with the parents? Our house is past the age of play dates, except for our granddaughters, and their parents are already well aware of my status and the care I take in maintaining it. Just asking the parents first might put Bishop’s mind at ease, or at the very least will warn the others about Bishop’s priorities. That would certainly work better than forcing thousands of law-abiding gun owners in her community to make their status public along with their address, turning the website into a targeting system for criminals who want to steal firearms. Oh, didn’t Bishop think of that? She probably also doesn’t realize that it will allow criminals to ascertain which homes do not have the means for effective self-defense, as Ed Driscoll points out. I wonder what that would do to her “luxury of being white and middle class” neighborhood. One thing’s for sure: it would bring that Foxtrot police helicopter closer more often than she likes. At least former Consumer Product Safety Commission chair Ann Brown doesn’t want to expose the personal data of gun owners to anyone who might wish them harm. Instead, the former bureaucrat wants more regulation on bullets. Brown laments that Congress stopped the CPSC from arrogating that power in the 1970s, and wants Congress to reverse itself now: In 1974, the CPSC’s first chairman made clear his belief that the agency could probably regulate ammunition, and a court agreed — whereupon a frightened Congress passed laws making it impossible even to try. Now is the time for the president to begin pushing to correct that mistake. Do I say this swayed by all the horrific mass shootings we have seen in the past few years? Only in part. These are the tragic, visible tip of an iceberg. While mass shootings attract headlines and our grief, bigger problems with guns often go unnoticed: the hundreds killed annually in intimate-partner violence; those killed by kids too young to know what pulling a trigger can do; the 21,000 Americans who commit suicide with a firearm each year. I admire the president for doing what he did this week. But the chance of achieving even a small reduction in this carnage through executive action is, well, small. And the chance of getting more effective gun-control measures through Congress this year is about zero. Was Congress “frightened” in 1974? Doubtful. They were probably more annoyed that bureaucrats would attempt an end-around an explicit constitutional liberty by attempting to expand their jurisdiction without a clear mandate from the legislative branch. So how would an “ammunition control” work? Brown explains: That is the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Under Republican and Democratic presidents, the commission has worked with manufacturers to create flexible guidelines for all kinds of hazardous products. It didn’t ban cribs, walkers, toasters — or paint. It worked out ways to address what made them dangerous — and saved children in the process. The same flexible approach can work with ammunition. When someone who may be dangerous is prevented from buying ammunition, any gun he has hidden becomes like a car without gas: a useless hunk of metal. There are many ways to move ahead. We could license ammunition purchases like drivers, ban online purchases and mandate background checks for buyers. If that sounds familiar, it should. It’s exactly what we do with firearms now. Clearly that has solved the problem of humans using tools for violent ends, yes? No? You don’t say. Besides, the CPSC most certainly does ban certain kinds of cribs, toasters, and paint, but it doesn’t regulate how much of an approved product people can buy. The FDA and DEA actually does do that with cold medicines like Sudafed to prevent the operation of meth labs. How well has that worked out? You don’t say. Finally, my colleague Damon Linker at The Week wants to concentrate only on mass shootings with his policy recommendation. Unlike many on the Left, Linker thinks an “assault weapons” ban is pointless, but he wants to do something else with those weapons — force them to be stored at approved ranges at all times: Leave single shot rifles alone. Leave most handguns alone. Leave laws on background checks and waiting periods alone. Instead, focus only on assault weapons. Define them to include all automatic and semi-automatic rifles, as well as high-capacity magazines that increase the number of bullets that can be fired by rifles and handguns without reloading. But don’t try to outlaw them, as the now-expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban did with some semi-automatic rifles. Simply require that they be purchased, stored, and used only at licensed dealers and firing ranges. Want to buy and shoot an AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifle, the gun that Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik allegedly used to murder 14 and injure 22 in San Bernardino last month, and the primary weapon Adam Lanza used to carry out the Sandy Hook massacre? Go right ahead. But you will be required to keep and shoot it exclusively on the premises of an establishment that exists expressly for that purpose. Visit that range as often as you like. Shoot the weapon to your heart’s content. But you won’t be allowed to leave with it, walk the streets with it, bring it into your home, or sell it directly to any other private citizen. … Would such a regulation, if imposed and enforced nationally, save lives? You bet it would. How can we know that? Because in a mass shooting, time is bullets. Anything that slows down the shooter does some good. Imagine if, instead of firing semiautomatic assault rifles, the San Bernardino shooters had been limited to shooting hand guns with standard magazines. Maybe they would have murdered 7, or 9, or 11 instead of 14. Maybe they would have injured 11, or 14, or 17 instead of 22. Or maybe they would have just kept reloading and shooting anyway. That’s what happened in the Virginia Tech and Fort Hood shootings, in which the perpetrators used handguns rather than long-barrel firearms. Nidal Hasan managed to shoot 214 rounds from a single pistol in his rampage. What Linker and others who focus on those miss is that magazines are relatively cheap, and the demented few who plan mass shootings would simply buy a couple of extra “standard” magazines for their insanity. Besides, as FBI records on homicides show, long-barrel firearm homicides are a very small percentage of that type of crime. In 2014, rifles of all kinds (semiautomatic or not) accounted for 2% of all homicides, and just 3% of firearms homicides. Shotguns actually have a slight edge over rifles. More than twice as many homicides take place with “personal” weapons, meaning arms and legs, hands and feet. This proportion has been consistent for at least the last ten years since the expiration of the assault weapons ban. In fact, homicides by rifles of all kind have declined since the 2005 expiration from 435 in that year to 248 in 2014, almost cut in half. For that matter, firearms homicides of all kinds have dropped 25% in the ten years since the ban expired — from over 10,000 to 8,124 in 2014. Linker responded to that criticism yesterday by saying he’s specifically targeting spree shooters. As noted above, though, not all spree shooters use rifles of any kind. More importantly, not all owners of so-called “assault weapons” are risks for spree shooting. On just the much-maligned AR-15 .223 semiautomatic rifle alone, the US had 3.3 million in homes before Newtown, before the threat of another ban led to a sales boom. Even if every rifle homicide in 2014 was the result of an AR-15 and the AR-15 was the only semiautomatic rifle in existence, those homicides would represent 0.0075% of all AR-15s. Why should 99.9925% of owners of the AR-15 be forced to have their property stored outside of their home on the off chance that 0.0075% of people might use one in a crime? And what exactly would Linker suggest doing to ensure that any owners of AR-15s are in compliance? House raids? These are deeply unserious proposals, based mostly on hysteria in an environment where gun violence is trending downward anyway. Gun ownership during the same period has trended upward, which should tell rational people that ownership of firearms (and bullets) in general is not correlative to gun violence. If any correlative conclusions are to be drawn, it’s that responsible gun ownership might actually discourage gun violence. Solutions to mass shootings involve dealing with the pathology of the shooters, not disarming law-abiding citizens. Update: The math was off on the calculations for rifle homicides compared to total AR-15s. It’s 0.0075%, not 0.75%. I’ve fixed it — it makes the argument much stronger anyway — and thanks to Nemo in the comments for the correction. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

          / AP TORONTO -- A remote aboriginal community in western Canada was left reeling from the unimaginable after a gunman opened fire at a school and a home, killing four people, including a teacher, and severely wounding at least two others. Residents placed candles and flowers in the snow in a makeshift memorial outside the grade 7-to-12 La Loche Community School in the Dene aboriginal community of La Loche in Saskatchewan Province. La Loche is a town of 3,000 where everybody seems to know each other. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Supt. Maureen Levy said the gunman was arrested outside the school Friday but declined to release details about him. She said there were two crime scenes, one at a home and the other at the school. Levy said four people were killed, but declined to give their ages or sex. The teacher killed at the school was identified by her boyfriend and father as 23-year-old Marie Janvier. Deegan Park, her boyfriend of three years, said he would have given up the rest of his life just to spend another year with her. ""I grew up not a good guy, but she turned me right,"" Park told The Associated Press. ""She was that much of a great person to turn me right from all the wrongdoings I used to do. ... She was a fantastic person."" ""I loved her, I really did,"" said Park, who remembered her smile and how she would blush when she was happy. Her father, Kevin Janvier, said police told him the gunman first shot two of his siblings before killing his daughter, his only child. ""He shot two of his brothers at his home and made his way to the school,"" he said. ""I'm just so sad."" A government official, however, told the AP the gunman shot two boys who are related but not his brothers at a home before heading to the school. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said he had been advised of the shooting by the RCMP. He said two wounded people were in critical condition. ""Obviously, this is every parent's worst nightmare,"" Trudeau said. ""The community is reeling."" A student who was just returning from lunch when the shots were fired Friday said his friends ran past him urging him to get out. ""'Run, bro, run!"" Noel Desjarlais-Thomas, 16, recalled his friends saying to him as they fled La Loche's junior and senior high school. ""There's a shotgun! There's a shotgun! They were just yelling to me. And then I was hearing those shots too, so of course I started running."" The RCMP said the first reports of shots being fired at the school came in around 1 p.m. Friday, and parents and residents were warned to stay away. A nearby elementary school was also placed on lockdown as a precaution. ""Words cannot express my shock and sorrow at the horrific events today in La Loche. My thoughts and prayers are with all the victims, their families and friends and all the people of the community,"" said Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall. Wall planned to visit the community on Sunday and promised to provide crisis support and counseling services. Shootings at schools or on university campuses are rare in Canada. However, the country's bloodiest mass shooting occurred Dec. 6, 1989, at Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique, when Marc Lepine entered a college classroom at the engineering school, separated the men from the women, told the men to leave and opened fire, killing 14 women before killing himself. Bobby Cameron, Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, said the shooting Friday was the worst tragedy to ever hit the community of 3,000. The Dene are an aboriginal group who inhabit the northern parts of Canada. ""It's not something you ever imagine happening here. The whole community, province and country has been affected and we will all go into mourning,"" said Cameron, who attended the La Loche school's graduation ceremony for the past few years. ""Right now we're just in a state of shock and disbelief."" U.S. Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman offered his condolences and noted the problem of school shootings in America. ""We have experienced similar tragedies far too often in the United States and understand all too well the heartache and sadness that result,"" Heyman said.

Nikki Haley ""believes deeply in the promise of the country we all share.” | Getty By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL 01/05/2016 03:36 PM EST Updated 01/05/2016 04:38 PM EST South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will deliver the response to President Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address on Tuesday, her office confirmed. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asked Haley to deliver the Republican response to Obama’s speech on Jan. 12. She described the entreaty as an honor and gave a sense of what she would speak about. “This is a time of great challenges for our country, but also of great opportunities,” Haley said in a statement. “I intend to speak about both.” Haley, a potential vice presidential pick, was reelected as South Carolina’s governor in November 2014. Born to Indian immigrants in Bamberg, South Carolina, she is the first female and first minority governor of the state. At 43, Haley is also the youngest governor in the country. White House By SARAH WHEATON and NICK GASS “In a year when the country is crying out for a positive vision and an alternative to the status quo, Gov. Haley is exactly the right choice to deliver the Republican Address to the Nation,” Ryan said in a statement. Haley's profile grew dramatically last year after the mass shooting at a historical black church in Charleston sparked nationwide calls to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Statehouse. Dylan Roof, who allegedly shot and killed nine parishioners — including state Sen. Clementa Pinckney — at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in June, was seen posing with a rebel flag in his purported manifesto. Haley in July signed a bill into law to remove the controversial flag from the Statehouse grounds, and was widely praised for her leadership during a wrenching period for her home state. “Nikki Haley is a proven leader and committed reformer who believes deeply in the promise of the country we all share,” McConnell said in a statement. “Not only has Governor Haley fought to bring opportunity and prosperity to the people of her state, but she’s also demonstrated how bringing people together can bring real results.” Despite praise for her bipartisan leadership following the Charleston massacre, Haley has, at times, been at odds with Democrats in her state and the Obama administration. More recently, she was among the dozens of Republican governors in November to say they would oppose admitting any Syrian refugees into their states. Obama plans to allow 10,000 Syrians escaping a civil war to seek refuge in the U.S. this year. Haley will be the third consecutive woman to deliver a response to Obama’s State of the Union. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst delivered the response last year, and GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers the year prior. Haley also will be the first South Carolinian to give the address and the first governor to do so since 2012 when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels gave the address. Missing out on the latest scoops?

He's participating in an interfaith dialogue that aims to address the biggest issues involving Islam on Feb. 8, 2015. (AP Photo/Willis Glassgow) CHERRY HILL -- The words were starting to get to Jeffrey Nash. In the wake of nationwide conversations surrounding Muslims in local communities, the heated rhetoric reached a point where the Camden County freeholder had to do something. So Nash stepped up to not only pass a county resolution condemning such language in solidarity with Muslim residents, he spurred the county to join in an upcoming interfaith dialogue that aims to address the root of the issue head on. ""It's important the Muslim community knows that their leadership stands behind them, that it's important to them, and it tells the community that this type of language is unacceptable, and here's why,"" said Nash. He'll join the conversation on Feb. 8 at 7 p.m., when the Katz Jewish Community Center in Cherry Hill will host Imam Morshad Saami Hossain of the Voorhees Islamic Center and Jewish Community Relations Council Executive Director David Snyder in a public forum entitled ""Extremism, Radicalization and Islam: Why are there so many acts of violence in the name of Islam?"" that Snyder said will be ""no holds barred."" ""It is an open conversation. The emphasis and the focus is on providing the opportunity to the community to ask what is on their minds, to inquire about the things they are confused about,"" said Snyder, adding these kinds of honest, interfaith conversations aren't common. ""There are a lot of Islamic leaders who will talk about Islam 101, but very few, from what we can tell, have actually tackled the issues of radicalization within their faith and address things at issue head on,"" he said. While radicalization concerns are far from new, the interfaith forum comes at a time when the influx of Syrian war refugees worldwide, the mass shooting in San Bernadino and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's controversial remarks about Muslim immigrants have sparked endless news coverage and debate over the true nature of Islam. ""It's a great opportunity in this moment. It's perfect for the time considering the climate of the political campaign,"" said Hossain, the Imam for the Voorhees Islamic Center. He said he knows there is support and understanding out in the community -- ""With every statement of bigotry that Trump says, we get a phone call saying 'We're your non-Muslim neighbors and we support you,"" said Hossain -- but to spread a true understanding, people from different faiths need to start talking openly and honestly about their divides. He wants to show people that radicalization isn't unique to Islam, and that there are far more similarities between Islam, Christianity and Judaism than there are differences. ""Our main objective now is to build that bridge between the two communities and really give them that sense of trust, that your Muslim neighbors are just as integral to the American fabric of society as anyone else and all of us want the same thing,"" said Hossain. ""We all fear terrorism, none of us want it and we have to work together in order to stop it.""

Follow Follow Sync events directly into your desktop, mobile or table calendar Add every episode to your calendar During his final State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Obama carved out around two minutes from his 58-minute speech to touch on the rise of Islamophobic rhetoric that’s been sweeping the nation. As Obama spoke optimistically about America’s future, he also took clear aim at the Republican party and its leading presidential front-runner Donald Trump for inciting fear and anti-Muslim sentiment. “When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad, or fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn’t make us safer. That’s not telling it what—telling it like it is, it’s just wrong,” Obama said on Tuesday. “It betrays who we are as a country.” Just three days before Obama’s address, a Muslim woman wearing a hijab was escorted out of Trump’s campaign rally in South Carolina after she stood up in silent protest when the GOP candidate suggested that Syrian refugees fleeing war in Syria were affiliated with the terrorist group ISIS. Trump has also previously called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Since getting ejected from Trump’s event, Rose Hamid—a 56-year-old flight attendant and Muslim activist—said she’s not looking for an apology; she just wants people to know that “Muslims are not the enemy.” Hamid’s message lies at the crux of the struggle faced by Muslim Americans right now: how to dismantle the idea that there is a clear link between the Muslim faith—Islam—and terrorists like ISIS. The debate surrounding Syrian refugees entering the U.S. took on an Islamophobic tone immediately following the devastating terrorist attacks in Paris, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility. A mass shooting in San Bernardino, California—less than three weeks later—was tied to ISIS. And just this week both Istanbul and Jakarta fell victims to suicide bombings that have also been linked back to ISIS. “I think probably the worst feeling in the world when we hear about something like 9/11 or San Bernardino or the Paris attacks—the worst possible thing I could hear after hearing about those tragedies—is that somebody who identifies as Muslim committed those crimes,” Nawara Alawa, a 24-year-old Muslim American, said during an interview. “I’m a victim of ISIS,” Saif Hamideh, a 23-year-old Muslim American whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Jordan, told me. Hamideh said not only is ISIS hurting his own people—the American people—and destroying his ancestral homeland, but the terrorist group is also threatening “the ideals of liberal democracy” intrinsic to our country. Young Muslim Americans like Alawa and Hamideh mostly chalk up rising anti-Muslim sentiment to a fear of the “unknown.” Indeed, a poll conducted by TIME in 2010 revealed that 62% of Americans didn’t “personally know a Muslim American.” But they do blame the media for perpetuating the stereotypes that have shaped public perception that suicide bombings and mass shootings are tenets of their religion. This community of Americans wants people to understand that ISIS does not represent Islam. “Islam is a religion of peace. There’s no violence, no imperialism in Islam,” Hamideh said. “I feel no need to apologize on behalf of ISIS because I have nothing to do with them. In fact, they’re fighting everything I stand for.” SHARE http://fus.in/1mWzkQ8 Copied to clipboard You can also watch: You are watching Feb 03, 2017 Trump has made IUDs a hit and his Supreme Court... 1:03 Dec 22, 2016 Fusion's Jorge Ramos on what he learned covering... 8:12 Dec 15, 2016 These deported vets are fighting to get back to... 6:13 Dec 15, 2016 This A-list fashion designer hoped to dress... 7:02 Dec 08, 2016 How a group of deported mothers are fighting... 8:35 Dec 08, 2016 From a race-baiting editor to elite insiders:... 6:20 Dec 07, 2016 A consistent education is almost impossible for... 6:32 Dec 06, 2016 Former LA mayor says many Mexicans are... 5:03 Nov 29, 2016 Jorge Ramos on what it was like to challenge... 7:27 Nov 29, 2016 Even some Republicans support open relations with...

The Islamic Society of Orange County is the oldest and largest mosque in the county.  Consider two men: Both are devout Muslims. Both are in their 20s, well-educated, new fathers. Both were born and raised in the United States but married women who only recently moved here from Muslim countries. Both, by all appearances, seem settled into their community. One of these men was Syed Rizwan Farook, the 28-year-old from Redlands who, with his wife, killed 14 people in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. The other is Feemun Dogar, the 26-year-old president of the Islamic Society of Orange County – and a new public face of peace-loving Muslims in Southern California. Dogar, a Garden Grove native, knows that when some non-Muslims see him, particularly in the wake of San Bernardino, he inspires fear. And while he believes that’s unfair, he also hopes to do everything he can to change that. Long term, Dogar says, it might even help that his background is eerily similar to Farook’s. “Here’s someone the same age, just married, having a kid – he’s trying to do something good for the community,” Dogar says of the way non-Muslims might perceive him. Toward that end, Dogar is eager to do what he can to replace Farook’s sullen image as the face of Islam in Southern California. “I want to uncover that shadow and say, ‘Look, there’s a whole different side of Muslim Americans that you don’t see.’ “Maybe the TV networks will call me,” Dogar says. “I’m ready.” A LOSING BATTLE Dogar, who works as a money manager in Los Angeles, was elected in July to his nonpaying position at the Islamic Society, a Garden Grove-based mosque and cultural center. The densely packed campus also houses a private elementary school (Orange Crescent) and a mortuary that serves Muslims from around Southern California. Dogar oversees administration of the organization, which is governed by a 17-member board of directors. The mosque’s spiritual leader is the 72-year-old Imam Muzzamil Siddiqi, who is among Dogar’s advisers. But Dogar also is a mosque official who’ll handle at least some public statements. And if recent history is a guide, that could become a tougher part of the job. For 15 years, since the attacks of Sept. 11, Muslim Americans have waged an increasingly difficult battle to define who they are in American society. And every time a person proclaiming to be Muslim commits a terrorist act, a burden falls upon Muslims like Dogar to issue condemnation and insist that radical Islamists do not represent their community. Much of that played out for Dogar on Dec. 2, when he heard of a mass shooting in San Bernardino. His first reaction was sympathy for the victims. His second was fear for his community. “I was praying it wouldn’t be a Muslim.” Then, when Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, surfaced as the shooters, Dogar’s mind raced to the same place as other Muslim leaders around the country: “This is not us.” And he braced for the backlash. Over the next few days the mosque – a fixture in the community for 40 years and a place of worship for thousands of people – received several phone threats. Along with beefing up security, mosque leaders called the FBI and local police, which increased patrols in their area. After the San Bernardino attack, the Orange County Human Relations Commission documented 12 hate incidents and two hate crimes “in just a matter of one week” directed at Muslims and Sikhs, said executive director Rusty Kennedy. On Dec. 6, the Islamic Society hosted a town hall, an event scheduled long before the San Bernardino attack. At the meeting, an Islamic Society founder, Zahir Ahmed, called for greater communication between American Muslims and the wider community. “They don’t know us,” Ahmed said, “and we don’t know them.” Dogar hopes to be part of that solution. “I really want to reach out to the media. Not for me, but for the institution of Islam, for the Muslim community in Orange County, in California, in the nation. Because we’re getting demoralized.” GENERATIONAL BRIDGE At 26, Dogar is the youngest administrative leader at the county’s oldest mosque. Dressed in a checkered shirt, dark jeans and athletic shoes on a Friday in late November – a few days before the attack in San Bernardino – Dogar visited the mosque, as he does every day, looking ready for one of the pickup basketball games he likes to play. Instead, before heeding the 1 p.m. call to prayer, Dogar handled bills related to a recent food festival and inquired about a fundraising campaign for rainy-day repairs. He checked out the menu at the Cham-Ya Grill, an on-site cafe he hopes to turn into more of a moneymaker for the mosque, and talked about initiating a program to raise awareness of mental and physical health issues. But as he went about this business, Dogar constantly stopped passers-by with a handshake or a warm greeting, prompting a visiting imam, Mohammed Faqih from the Islamic Institute of Orange County in neighboring Anaheim, to quip that Dogar “acts presidential.” Dogar’s mentors use words like “energetic” and “enthusiastic” when talking about why they supported the choice of someone so young to be the mosque’s administrative leader. They also call him mature, professional and responsible. Dogar sees his role as a bridge between generations. “It’s about that bond.” Dogar virtually grew up at the mosque, attending Orange Crescent School for all but a few years in his childhood when his father served overseas as an engineer with the U.S. Department of Defense. His mother was a homemaker, raising him and his two brothers. The family lived in Saudi Arabia and in Pakistan during his father’s foreign assignments. His mother, the daughter of a lawyer, was raised in Pakistan. His father is from a poor farming family in India. Dogar graduated from high school at Fairmont Preparatory Academy in Anaheim and went to college at UC Riverside. He showed an early interest in diplomacy, and when he was 21 he served a seven-month internship at the United Nations. During that period, he says he was profiled by security officers at Los Angeles International Airport, who detained him for a half-hour while they ran a background check and peppered him with questions. He shrugs it off now, saying it was “unfortunate,” but the experience reflects what many young Muslims face regularly. “He knows the struggles,” says Ruman Khan, 30, a friend from Anaheim who has known Dogar for years. “He can guide the youth.” FOCUS ON YOUTH Haitham Bundakji, 68, a past president of the mosque and for years a chaplain with the Garden Grove Police Department, says someone like Dogar can help reduce the possibility of someone like Farook. “They can reach out to the younger generation and get them involved in the right things,” says Bundakji, who knows personally the danger posed by those attracted to terrorist groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State. In the late 1990s, Bundakji was punched by Adam Yahiye Gadahn, the Orange County man who converted to Islam and became an infamous mouthpiece for al-Qaida. Gadahn was killed early last year by a drone strike in Pakistan. “I want the youth to understand Islam the right way,” says Bundakji. “It’s not these crazy nuts, murderers and criminals.” Dogar’s wife, Effat Sultana, says her husband doesn’t talk that much at home about the San Bernardino shootings because he doesn’t want to worry her. Instead, she says, he tries to stay positive. “He’s so optimistic,” says Sultana, a physician who is studying for her U.S. medical license exam. “I love that about him.” Dogar’s mother introduced him to Sultana two years ago, after his parents moved to Pakistan so family could help care for his ailing father.

224,http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/01/president_obama_wants_a_smart_gun_njit_has_one_in.html," Gallery: NJIT's 'smart gun' research NEWARK -- If we've developed technology that allows us to unlock a cell phone with a fingerprint, why haven't we done the same for guns? That's the question an emotional President Obama asked earlier this week at a White House press conference announcing a series of new gun control measures. Included in the provisions was a memo of understanding calling on the federal government to come up with a plan within 90 days to spur research into ""smart gun"" technology. ""If a child can't open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure that they can't pull a trigger on a gun. Right?,"" Obama said. The president's actions were a much-needed ray of hope for ""smart gun"" researchers who have been hampered in recent years by a shortage of funding, complex legal restrictions and the vehement opposition of gun control opponents. Researchers have long been working on technologies that would use fingerprint scanners or special computer chips linked to rings or watches to ensure than only authorized users could fire a specific gun. But most of the research has never made it out of the lab. New Jersey Institute of Technology researchers spent more than a decade developing a handgun that recognized its owner's grip. Sixteen sensors in the gun's grip would distinguish the unique way each person holds a firearm and ensure only authorized users could fire. Researchers on the Newark campus were about two years away from a prototype ready for mass testing when their funding dried up, said Donald Sebastian, NJIT's senior vice president of research and development. ""Our status is we're in mothballs,"" said Sebastian, who led the project. ""We stretched it as far as we could."" NJIT began its smart gun research in the late 1990s at the request of state lawmakers. The school's demonstrations of its Dynamic Grip Recognition guns drew national attention. A parade of politicians, including Sen. Frank Lautenberg, Gov. Jon Corzine, Sen. Robert Menendez and Gov. James E. McGreevey, came to the lab or attended demonstrations. The project drew millions of dollars in grants. Researchers promised their smart guns would work even if the authorized user was wearing gloves or had wet hands. The plan was to get the smart guns into the hands of police officers and the military for real-life testing. But, in 2008 the federal funding ran out and NJIT's research began petering out before shutting down two years ago. Most of the researchers have moved on to new jobs. The disassembled prototypes of the Dynamic Grip Recognition smart guns are packed away in boxes, Sebastian said. NJIT worked with a West Coast entrepreneur to try and find investors to continue the work. But private funding was scarce. Sebastian said he would love to revive the research if Obama's promise to back ""smart gun"" technology results in funding for researchers. ""Sure, we'd love to get back in the game and push it across the finish line,"" Sebastian said. A lack of money has not been the only obstacle standing in the way of smart gun researchers. Some gun control opponents have tried to block smart guns from ever getting on the market. Gun owners have expressed concerns that the technology will be faulty and keep them from firing their weapons when their lives are on the line. Others are worried the federal government will eventually outlaw traditional guns and mandate that only smart guns will be sold in the U.S. The National Rifle Association, the nation's leading gun-rights organization, dismissed Obama's new gun control provisions earlier this week. ""We will not allow law-abiding gun owners to be harassed or intimidated for engaging in lawful, constitutionally-protected activity - nor will we allow them to become scapegoats for President Obama's failed policies,"" Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement. In the past, the NRA has said it does not oppose research into smart gun technology. But it does oppose any laws that would require gun owners to purchase weapons with smart technology. Attempts to offer smart guns for sale in the U.S. have not gone well. In 2014, gun shops in California and Maryland agreed to sell the Armatix iP1, a gun made by a German company that only fires if the user is wearing a special watch. The shops' owners said they thought the gun would attract buyers who were looking for a way to ensure their kids would not accidentally fire the weapon. But the shops quickly backed out of offering the smart gun amid angry protests and death threats. Part of the problem was gun control opponents were worried the sale of the Armatix would trigger a controversial New Jersey law. A 2002 New Jersey law would require New Jersey firearms dealers to sell only smart guns three years after they go on the market in the U.S. That law was intended to promote development of smart guns. But gun law researchers say the New Jersey law has prompted gun rights activists to pressure gun dealers and gun manufacturers to never offer a single smart gun for sale out of fear that it would trigger the New Jersey law and lead to the end of the sale of traditional guns. State Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen), who sponsored the original law, introduced a replacement law last year that would loosen the restrictions on gun dealers. The new legislation would only require New Jersey dealers to offer one smart gun for sale if they become available. The legislation (S3249) was approved by the state Senate last month. An identical bill is awaiting a vote in the Assembly. If it passes, it is unclear if Gov. Chris Christie will sign the new law. Christie has said in the past that New Jersey's original smart gun law should be repealed. Christie, who is campaigning for the Republican nomination for president, has been dismissive on the campaign trail of Obama's latest efforts to impose gun restrictions via executive order. Gun manufacturers have also been lukewarm about Obama's new gun initiatives, including the attempt to promote smart gun technology. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the national trade association representing gun manufacturers, said it does not oppose smart gun research. But consumers should be able to decide whether they want the technology, the group said in a statement earlier this week. ""How additional government research into this technology would advance it is unclear,"" the group's statement said. At NJIT, Sebastian acknowledges the type of smart gun developed by the university would not have prevented many of the recent mass shootings. The Sandy Hook school massacre that killed 26 children and adults would likely still have happened because the shooter in that case used his own gun. But other shootings, including the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., may have been prevented because the couple in that case were allegedly using weapons purchased by a friend, Sebastian said. Supporters say smart guns could potentially cut down on the 30,000 gun deaths in the U.S. each year, including cases where children play with guns, teen suicides and incidents where police officers lose their weapons while scuffling with suspects. ""Those are problems worth solving,"" Sebastian said. Kelly Heyboer may be reached at kheyboer@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @KellyHeyboer. Find NJ.com on Facebook.

226,http://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2016/01/14/why-statistics-give-us-a-false-sense-of-security/,"This article was originally published at Stratfor.com. By Philip Bobbitt Whenever an atrocity is committed by terrorists attacking citizens in the West -- a carefully chosen limitation -- editorial writers and political commentators are quick to provide the statistical equivalent of Alka-Seltzer: Take a couple of these complacency tablets and by morning you'll have forgotten whatever it was that upset you in the first place. All of us are familiar with these statistical bromides. ""There are about 2.25 million people in Paris. This means that, if you were living in Paris on the day of the recent attacks, there was roughly a one in 20,000 chance of being the victim -- about the same likelihood as getting killed by a car in France."" Or, ""In Paris, the annual murder rate has recently been as high as 2.6 per hundred thousand people; thus the terrorist attacks this year more than doubled the average murder rate. But this only makes Paris about as dangerous as New York City, which is generally considered a very safe city. So while terrorism may have made life in France more dangerous, the new level of danger is one we tolerate in the United States."" Or, ""In the United States, on average, there is about one mass shooting -- that is, shootings in which four or more people are killed or injured by gunfire -- every day. Thus the killings in San Bernardino, Calif., were just another average day in the United States."" Perhaps you've heard this one: The average American is more likely to be struck by lightning than killed by terrorists. In America, 30,000 people die every year in accidental falls, 35,000 die in car crashes, and 39,000 die of accidental poisonings and drug overdoses. By these measures, deaths from terrorism -- including the deaths on 9/11 -- are practically trivial. What is Global Affairs? Thus from these statistics, it is concluded that however natural it may be to react with horror at terrorist violence, it is really irrational. Moreover, this conclusion is often accompanied by another conclusion: Such irrational overreactions feed terrorism, giving the violent extremists exactly what they want. After all, aren't they trying to frighten us? Isn't that the point of terror? The problem with this ""statistical"" argument is that it is permeated with corrupted data. In the first place, lightning strikes and slips and falls are not aimed at destroying the legitimacy of our system of government, separating us from our allies, and isolating vulnerable populations. Deaths from auto accidents were a good deal higher when the threats we faced from terror were less. In the second place, it is unlikely that the number of deaths from peanut allergies and drownings in bathtubs will escalate dramatically, whereas the possibility that terrorists might acquire weapons of far greater lethality than they have thus far deployed is by no means fanciful. What does it matter? What's the harm in a little reassurance? We all agree that panic can cause us to do harm to ourselves and our institutions. The problem is that, despite the alarms sounded by the civil liberties community, there isn't much evidence we are panic-stricken; indeed the reason we are not panic-stricken is because the extent of the killings, in the West, has been so minor. But I draw the opposite conclusion from this fact. Because we are living in a period of relative tranquility, we should be using this time to fashion laws and practices, to stockpile emergency routines and vaccines, to carefully reassess our protocols for responding to real mass emergencies so that when vastly more lethal attacks come we don't react in panic. But the statistical tranquilizers have just the opposite effect: They enervate us by telling us that there's really nothing to worry about and that, indeed, any action we might take would only make things worse by rewarding the terrorists who have rattled us. Often this fallacious rhetorical ploy is accompanied by another one, the ugly insinuation I will call ""cui bono,"" to whose profit. This innuendo implies that the only motive for sounding the alarm against terror, since the threat is so insignificant, must be a self-serving desire by politicians to aggrandize their own power. So it is not really so surprising, though it is disgraceful, that The New York Times included this paragraph in an opinion piece otherwise devoted to a rather banal statistical antidepressant: ""A cynical individual might wonder who benefits more from the terror induced by terrorism: the terrorists themselves or the politicians and governments who use the public reaction to acts of terror for political gain … John McCain said, in response to the president's address on the San Bernardino shooting, that 'this is the war of our time' ... Jeb Bush has proclaimed that 'we are at war with ISIS' … Herman Goering said, 'the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked. It works the same way in any country.' We need to be vigilant against those who seek to manipulate us -- whoever they are."" Rather than traducing our politicians -- and I'm a Democrat by the way -- wouldn't it be prudent to begin by addressing the question of whether we are at war on the merits? Is it really inconceivable that war, in our time, is morphing from the large-scale conventional conflicts fought by conscripts that characterized the 20th century into more spatially diverse and temporally punctuated attacks by coordinated networks? Or that at the same time, terrorism is evolving away from the national liberation struggles of the past century and assuming a lethality and a global character hitherto reserved to nation states? That might require a little more thought, and a good deal more argument, but if it is true then the statistics that have been trotted out to minimize the problem are actually irrelevant.

Every Monday A Georgia town becomes a magnet for refugees – including from Syria – despite resistance to the newcomers in many parts of the South. Can Clarkston be a model? Loading... January 17, 2016 In another life, one man owned four blacksmith shops, a second sold mattresses, and a third labored as a skilled mason. Now the former Syrian patriarchs are standing nervously on a stage at the Clarkston Community Center in this Atlanta suburb, where the mayor and a local congressman are welcoming them to their new home in the United States. The Syrian refugees – about 50 in all – have fled political brutality in their home country and settled in this working-class town that has become a new Ellis Island for immigrants in a state and region which, at least recently, have turned decidedly hostile to outsiders. Indeed, since 1983, the town has accepted and helped resettle about 60,000 refugees – most from Africa and many of whom were Muslim. The locals’ hospitality has turned the community into what is considered the most ethnically diverse square mile in the US. Now comes another wave of outsiders – a group of Syrians that so many other places in the US have spurned. After the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, which were carried out by Islamic militants tied to Islamic State in Syria, Georgia Republican Gov. Nathan Deal signed an executive order demanding that state agencies “halt any involvement” in resettling Syrian refugees. It was a largely symbolic gesture, given that refugee policy is set by the federal government. But the message was sent – and it was backed, according to opinion polls, by a strong majority of the state’s residents. The anti-immigrant sentiment only hardened after the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., which was carried out in part by a devout Pakistani woman vetted by the State Department for a K-1, or fiancé(e), visa. Presidential contenders such as Donald Trump, as well as state officials such as Mr. Deal, have lashed out at what they see as a faceless Syrian invasion, reflecting deeper historical fears about hidden threats in the continuous stream of immigrants coming to America. The Syrian newcomers to Clarkston, which the US Office of Refugee Resettlement sent here because of the town’s welcoming ethos, are well aware of the conflict swirling around them. “For them, this is a big day, but it’s also painful,” says one young Syrian asylum seeker who works as an accountant at a chicken-processing plant in the area. That is why local officials are doing so much to try to make them feel at ease this afternoon. Inside the community center, chunks of lamb and a gourmet display of pastries are spread out on tables. Clarkston Mayor Ted Terry and others give impassioned speeches about how America has drawn its strength from immigrants. Refugee children, clad in immaculate clothing, look on while smiling nervously. Clarkston offers both a cautionary tale of the costs of increased resettlement in a volatile time as well as a model for how America can play perhaps an even larger role in humanitarian relief while keeping its security intact. In many ways, Clarkston has emerged, along with St. Louis; Portland, Maine; and Dearborn, Mich., as one of the most successful resettlement communities in the world. Four out of 5 families who show up here become self-sufficient within six months of arriving – a good thing given that most refugees only receive government subsidies for three months after settling here. (If they’re found eligible, they can also receive state and federal welfare benefits.) Yet Clarkston is hardly an immigrant utopia. Schools in the area have struggled to educate refugee children, who often lag behind in learning after they get here, pulling down overall test scores. According to Michael Singleton, Georgia’s state refugee coordinator, the refugee flow has stretched resources and “there have been reports of robbery and refugee gang violence” in the town as well as in surrounding communities. Indeed, while the parents almost never get into trouble, the Americanized sons and daughters of refugees sometimes do, including a group of Burmese teenagers known as “the slingshot kids” for their hunting of squirrels and birds. As Clarkston opens its cafes and classrooms to the latest arrivals, the question is, Will it continue to be a symbol of how diversity can work, or exemplify how the country is going too far in sheltering some of the world’s huddled masses? “What you’re seeing in a little town [like Clarkston and others in the surrounding area] is both people being decent and at the same time exhibiting fear of some amorphous refugee jihadist,” says Sarah Lischer, an international affairs professor at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. •     •      • Clarkston was an improbable place to become a national magnet for immigrants. For most of its history, it was simply a sleepy goat-farming town – dubbed “Goatsville” – with a train depot along a well-used railroad line. Then, in the 1970s, it became one of Atlanta’s first bedroom communities, thanks to the building of the city’s “perimeter” highway, Interstate 285, which opened the entire metro area up to a 30-minute commute. Developers built dozens of apartment complexes, which housed upwardly mobile white-collar workers, many of them engineers from overseas. But by the early 1980s, these newcomers had moved on to tonier towns, and the well-worn apartment warrens they left behind began to fall into disrepair while property values went down. In 1983, the Reagan administration formalized what had been an impromptu refugee-resettlement program, and Clarkston became a favored spot to locate newcomers. The bones of the town were still solid. Atlanta’s rapid transit system, MARTA, ended at its border. Atlanta was booming, as was the job market. And Clarkston’s apartments, though not upscale, were cheap and provided walkable access to transportation and jobs. They also provided shelter far superior to any United Nations refugee tent. No matter that the next town over, Stone Mountain, was the site of the modern revival of the Ku Klux Klan in 1915. Even in the history-sensitive South, that all seemed a long time ago. By the 1990s, the influx of refugees – mainly from Eritrea, Somalia, and a few other African countries – had become steady. The Clarkston Baptist Church, whose imposing steeple stands as the tallest point in town, faced a decisive moment, like many local institutions: Adapt to the refugee population or wither away. The church fathers looked to Scripture and transformed the church into the Clarkston International Bible Church, a place where Ephesians 2:19 – “you are no longer strangers and foreigners ...” – is often read. The church’s basement is now a mini-Babel known as the Cafe Clarkston, where church groups help new arrivals write résumés and polish their English, and provide, for many, an introduction to friendly Americans. The population of Clarkston, about 7,000 in the 1990s, grew 34 percent as refugee families from more than 150 different ethnic groups poured into the community. Sleepy strip malls began to convert into colorful storefronts flying prayer flags and offering halal meat. A ragtag group of refugee soccer players unified under a Jordanian-born coach, inspiring the book “Outcasts United,” which in turn inspired a widely lauded academy for refugee children. “Clarkston has become a self-fulfilling prophecy,” says Brian Bollinger, executive director of Friends of Refugees, a local nonprofit group that tries to empower refugees through jobs and education. “As more new Americans start life here, the easier it is for the next round to start and to do well. The ethnic shops and language communities and religious communities coalesce and form a springboard.” Since then, the transformation of Clarkston into a refugee mecca has become nearly complete. A population that 30 years ago was almost 90 percent white is now less than 14 percent white. Today, Refuge Coffee Co., a not-for-profit coffee truck, sets up at an old gas station that serves as the informal town square. Women with colorful headdresses walk purposefully along the town’s paths, and bearded Muslim men hold the hands of kids at the bus stop. The coexistence of so many faiths, cultures, and languages gained widespread attention. “It’s the unexciting story of everyday mediocrity that is probably one of the best signs that assimilation is happening,” Adam Hoyt, who directs a local refugee job center, told World Magazine in 2013. •      •      • While many of Clarkston’s institutions have adapted and become boosters of the outsiders over the years, local leaders have embraced them with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Consider the case of Mayor Terry, a goateed administrator with blue eyes and a shock of blond hair who looks as if he’d be comfortable playing in a neo-blues band. Terry came to the latest immigration controversy through a bit of serendipity. The 33-year-old won office in 2013 on a plank that had more to do with building the town’s tax base than defending refugees on a national stage. But since terror concerns have risen, he has found himself in the sometimes unpopular role of refugee host, defending the incoming residents of Clarkston against what seems to some a building xenophobia. Through the process, he says, the town, in essence, has discovered its true identity. “The old town fathers never felt like they needed to [build the town],” he says. “They were content to have a small little town that harkened back to the good old days. But Clarkston sort of woke up and found that it had become an international city.” At the Syrian banquet, Terry spoke about the hard-line rhetoric, and how it betrays America’s fundamental promise to newcomers. But he has also incredulously had to announce, only half-jokingly, that “there’ll be no sharia law in Clarkston as long as I’m mayor.” In an interview, Terry acknowledges coming into office knowing almost nothing about refugees. He learned quickly on the campaign trail. He remembers one Bhutanese mother in traditional dress waving him in for a coffee, eager to practice her English. “Then the son comes in, wearing his baseball cap like Justin Bieber,” he says. Terry’s political profile has risen as he’s shot back at Georgia’s conservative leadership over their hard-line stance. But in the end, he says, preserving the flow of refugees is as much about capitalistic survival as the debate over the clash of humanitarian responsibilities and national security. The fact is, Clarkston has come to rely on refugees as a source of economic progress. While some work in chicken-processing plants as far as two hours away, nearly 500 refugees from 38 different countries are employed at the nearby Your Dekalb Farmers Market, providing a unique interface between the ethnic newcomers and Atlanta’s emerging foodie class. More specifically to Clarkston, dozens of entrepreneurs have opened their own businesses, including Somali restaurants and grocery stores featuring sambusas and sabaayad. The refugees are “expanding prosperity ... by opening new businesses that add to the tax base, employ local residents, and bring fresh ideas and products to our community!” the local Coalition of Refugee Services reported in 2014. Some 80 percent of the newcomers find jobs within six months of arriving – the highest rate of any refugee-resettlement community in the country. Immigration supporters believe the economic boost that the refugees bring has – and will – translate far beyond Clarkston. Given that the US birthrate has fallen too low to sustain economic growth by itself, “immigration is fundamentally critical to sustaining a capitalist country,” adds Mr. Bollinger, the Friends of Refugees director. In Clarkston, the refugees are dreaming bigger, too. A Syrian-American college grad named Aladdin Kanawati wants to use the farming expertise many of the refugees are bringing with them to help transform Georgia’s agricultural sector. He is lobbying Georgia’s labor and agriculture commissioners to help steer future refugees into rural Georgia, where demographic shifts have sucked vitality out of many communities. “These are exactly the people we want,” says Terry. •      •      • Yet not everyone is enamored of their presence. Joe Newton is a retired law clerk who lives in a largely Hispanic corner of nearby Norcross, Ga. He spends much of his time lobbying against refugee funding. Over a cup of hot chocolate at a local coffee shop, Mr. Newton says Syrians like those settling in Clarkston represent an existential threat – and not just because of terrorism concerns. He sees them drawing resources away from native-born Americans. To him and other critics, the $1.6 billion annual budget that the US government spends to resettle refugees is part of a “scam” perpetrated by nongovernmental organizations, which take the federal dollars and then leave the naive refugees to fend for themselves. He believes the benefits could be better spent on Americans. “We’ve been way more generous toward refugees than we should have been,” says Newton. Until the Paris attacks, Newton was a fringe political player, a citizen lobbyist who called legislators out by name for spending on refugees. But since the November shootings, his voice has found more resonance. Three out of 5 Republican primary voters now want to bar Syrian refugees from the US, compared with 1 out of 3 who felt the same way in September. Only about 20 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of independents feel that way. “For years, I was labeled as a kook, a bigot, prejudiced, a skinhead, a Nazi, and everything else,” says Newton. “Now, there’s been a stampede towards my view.” He says the numbers are what shock him. Even though the number of Syrian refugees admitted to the US so far has added up to just 1,800, more than 100,000 Syrians have arrived in all since the civil war broke out, on a variety of visas and work permits. “This is a huge, huge migration, not just a few refugees,” he says. He notes that he has a friend who is a veteran who can’t get treatment for a serious illness. But the US sinks millions into helping newcomers. “It’s all upside down,” he says of the nation’s priorities. The pressure on Clarkston has only mounted as the Obama administration has fashioned a plan to quadruple the number of Syrians arriving in 2016. For Georgians who share Newton’s views, Clarkston is hardly a model of what a citizen factory looks like. It’s a potential hotbed of problems, a “refuge for criminals” holding the rest of America back even as strangers populate its streets, as Lucretia Hughes, a local African-American activist, puts it. She believes the refugees are unfairly siphoning resources that should be going to poverty-bound black students. “The problems spread out from [Clarkston],” she says. •      •       • The debate over immigration swirling through the piney woods of Georgia is one that has a long pedigree in the US. Throughout history, America has always been the world’s premier melting pot – but has also had its share of backlashes to the influx of newcomers. In the 1780s, for instance, there were concerns in some areas that German was going to become the de facto official language in the US. “You can go all the way back to the Colonial era and there are these persistent strands of an us-versus-them mentality, though the definition of who is ‘us’ and who is ‘them’ has changed over time,” says University of Washington professor Jacob Vigdor, a fellow at the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration at University College London. Part of the periodic resistance has been driven by the immigrants themselves: the proclivity of many of them to want to close the doors behind them once they have arrived. But the backlash to today’s refugees is rooted in two other powerful forces: first, a slowdown in middle-class mobility in a changing and often struggling US economy, and, now, a tangible national security threat from the Middle East. Clarkston has not been immune to these pressures. By 2013, Clarkston leaders had enacted three separate one-year moratoriums on new refugees, as local officials grew alarmed by the rapid changes and new problems refugees brought. In particular, the impulse by some immigrants to cloister in their own communities raised concerns about their willingness to assimilate into American life. And while the election of Terry in 2013 may have marked a new era for the town, he may also have tied his political future to an issue that is far from resolved: It could yet lead to a crackdown on America’s welcoming stance toward the world’s dispossessed – even here in the Babel of Georgia. One who has hope that it won’t is Awet Eyasu. Mr. Eyasu, who works for a legal-services firm, came to the US 15 years ago after fleeing one of the globe’s most repressive regimes in Eritrea. He moved to Clarkston with his young family after graduating from the University of California, Los Angeles. Eyasu seems to have transformed from an African to an American to, now, a true Southerner. He’s pro-Second Amendment and gun ownership, worries about taxes, and respects cops. That was part of his message as he recently knocked on nearly 1,000 doors during a campaign to convince Clarkston’s voters to elect him to the Clarkston Town Council. To many of them, he introduced himself by his nickname, “Howard.” In November, just days before the Paris attacks, he won the election, becoming the first person of Eritrean descent to hold office in Georgia.

Though some worry that the US is hardening its line on immigrants and refugees, Eyasu has found America, and Clarkston specifically, “an ultimately tolerant place.” At the same time, he argues that the ability of the US to better vet ethnic newcomers can be addressed without taking draconian measures such as requiring a registry for Syrian refugees, as Republican front-runner Donald Trump has pitched. The political rhetoric is driven by “pure fear, I would say, but I can also understand it when people worry about immigrants who do not want to be integrated and do not want to adapt to the culture here,” he says. “But even though it’s a scary time, when you really think about it, America should not be reversing all the progress that we’ve achieved. It’d be better if we slow down and just try to digest what we have achieved already.” Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

Brooks Patterson file photo, Sept. 30, 2015. (Courtesy of Oakland County) Despite former Florida Governor Jeb Bush's mediocre success versus party rivals in his pursuit the presidential nomination, Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson, a longtime Republican, says he remains a loyal supporter. ""I was friends with his father, his brother, and I have a loyalty to the relationship,"" Patterson said while joining a panel on the political talk show ""Michigan Matters"" Sunday. ""But I did think Jeb would do better than he is. ""It's amazing and I think I can draw one conclusion so far: Jeb Bush is not a debater."" And though Patterson is surprised Donald Trump hasn't fizzled in the polls, he's on board with Trump's proposal to shut down all immigration until a better vetting process can be put in place. ""I stopped saying (predicting Trump's downfall) because in every week he amazes me, he's stronger, the percentage goes up,"" Patterson said. ""I thought some of his remarks would bring him down ... "" Trumps firm anti-immigration stance, especially since the mass shooting in San Bernardino, was among the talk show topics Sunday, and it's one area Patterson is in agreement with the brash businessman turned politician. ""It's not a bad idea,"" said Patterson, the former Oakland County prosecutor and county executive since 1992. Patterson recently told Pontiac officials to halt progress in the creation of a development targeting Syrian immigrants. ""The problem in San Bernardino is they were vetted ... "" Patterson said. ""They had a rule, they could not look at social media ... but social media is where you're going to find these things. ""I'm more concerned about protecting my constituents in my county,"" Patterson said later in the conversation. ""I've got a photograph of a jar full of M&Ms, like 10,000 M&Ms, and help yourself but understand four of them are poison. ""Who's going to give (them) to their kids then. Who's going to take the risk."" Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

233,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/campaign-2016-final-poll-released-ahead-of-iowa-caucuses-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/,"Watch CBSN Live  Updated on:  January 30, 2016 / 11:32 PM
          / CBS/AP DES MOINES, Iowa -- The last major preference poll before Monday's Iowa caucuses showed a change at the top of the GOP race. The Iowa Poll, published Saturday by The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg, said Republican real estate mogul Donald Trump has the support of 28 perfect of likely caucus goers, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 23 percent and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 15 percent. It's the first time Trump has led this poll since August, pollsters said. Trump's support has risen by six points since early January, and 71 percent of his supporters say their minds are made up. The poll was taken beginning the day after Trump announced he would skip last week's GOP debate. It's not a decision that seems likely to hurt him -- 46 percent of likely caucus goers said they didn't care and 24 percent approved of his decision. Only 29 percent didn't approve.    Should voters have second thoughts, Cruz could benefit -- he leads the group who could change their minds, albeit by a small margin, over Trump and Marco Rubio. A plurality of Ben Carson's voters chose Cruz second. One troubling sign for Cruz, however, is that his favorability, though still quite high, at 65 percent, has dropped 11 percentage points since early January. On the Democratic side, the survey finds former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with 45 percent support to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 42 percent. Both candidates see an increase in support, with Clinton up by three percentage points since early January and Sanders up by two. Clinton leads among voters who say they are certain to caucus, and Sanders has an edge with voters who said they would probably caucus. Three percent of likely Democratic caucus goers chose Martin O'Malley, which shows a drop of a percentage point since January. The poll of 602 likely Republican caucus-goers and 602 likely Democratic caucus-goers was taken Tuesday to Friday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The candidates and their surrogates crisscrossed state Saturday in a frenzied weekend prelude to the first presidential contest of the 2016 race which has taken an unexpected turn with the emergence of outsider candidates who have challenged the establishment in both parties. Iowa offers only a small contingent of the delegates who will determine the nominees at each party's national convention in July. But Monday's caucuses will provide a test of whether the large enthusiastic crowds turning out at rallies for Trump and Sanders will turn into actual votes. The caucuses should also help winnow out the crowded Republican field and provide momentum heading into the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary.     Trump, the showman of the Republican race, made a dramatic entrance to a Dubuque rally as his jet flew low over a hangar half-filled by the waiting crowd and music played from the movie ""Air Force One."" There was more drama inside, as a small group of protesters interrupted him and Trump joined the crowd in chanting ""USA"" to drown out the discord. He asked security to ""get them out"" but ""don't hurt them."" Cruz directed much of his last-gasp advertising against Rubio, as he chugged across the state on a mission to visit all 99 counties before Monday's caucuses. Cruz's ads sharply challenged Rubio's conservative credentials. One ad said darkly of Rubio: ""Tax hikes. Amnesty. The Republican Obama."" ""A deceitful campaign,"" Rubio said in response to Cruz. ""Kitchen sink attacks,"" he said. ""That's what they throw at you."" Asked whether Rubio could win or come second, his senior strategist Todd Harris laughingly responded with an obscenity and said the goal in Iowa is third.     ""There's no question we are feeling some wind at our back,"" Harris told The Associated Press. But, he added, ""It's very hard to compete with the greatest show on earth and the greatest ground game in Iowa history. So we feel very confident that what we need to do here is finish a strong third. I don't care what any of the polls say, Ted Cruz is going to win this caucus."" Rubio is hoping to emerge as the favorite within the establishment wing of the party heading into New Hampshire, where he is trying to fend off challenges from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. In the Democratic race, Sanders spoke for many when at a Manchester rally he called the Democratic contest against Hillary Clinton a likely tossup, to be won and lost according to how many Iowans invest the time and energy to make it to caucus sites at schools, churches and even private homes. ""It's virtually tied,"" Sanders said, a reasonable summation of polls. ""We will win the caucus on Monday night if there is a large voter turnout. We will lose the caucus on Monday night if there is a low voter turnout."" The Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist said ""the eyes of America, in fact much of the world"" would be on Iowa, and the state could be a model for the future of American democracy.     ""When ordinary people, working people, middle class people, seniors, young people become involved in the political process, we can transform this country and we can win here in Iowa,"" Sanders said. Clinton has worked assiduously to avoid a repeat of 2008, when then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama scored a surprise win in Iowa. She finished third in the caucuses and her days as the prohibitive favorite for the nomination faded. She faced the prospect of escalating political heat from revelations Friday that the private email server she used when she was Obama's first secretary of state contained top-secret messages that should have remained within proper, secured channels. That heat was coming from Republicans; Sanders earlier declared the email flap a nonissue in his mind. However, Sanders has raised the issue of the large speaking fees and campaign donations that Clinton has received from leading financial firms and other corporations. At Sanders' Manchester rally, Ruth Lewin, a retired grocery store clerk and child care provider, said the latest news about Clinton's emails reinforced why she will be caucusing for Sanders on Monday. ""It's a matter of honesty, integrity along with other issues I have about her,"" Lewin said.  ""When you get $600,000 for a speaking engagement, I mean that's more than I've made in my entire lifetime."" Clinton emphasized the issue of gun regulations at a rally at Iowa State University in Ames, where she was joined by former Rep, Gabby Giffords, who was severely wounded in a mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly. The former secretary of state drew an implicit contrast between her push for stricter laws with Sanders' mixed record on gun control measures. ""How can we continue to ignore the toll that this is taking on our children and our country?"" Clinton asked. ""When you go to caucus Monday night please think of this."" The Clinton and Sanders campaigns reached agreement to hold a debate in New Hampshire this coming week and three more in the spring, supplementing a light debate schedule that has favored weekend slots when fewer people watch TV.

235,http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/magazine/why-is-it-so-difficult-for-syrian-refugees-to-get-into-the-us.html,"Feature Of the 4.5 million people who have fled the Syrian war, only 2,647 have been taken in by the United States. Ahmad al-Haj Ali, 17, at his family’s house in Aurora, Ill.Credit...Peter van Agtmael/Magnum, for The New York Times Supported by By Eliza Griswold ‘We aren’t the kind of family that sends our daughters to work,’’ Mahmoud al-Haj Ali told me one evening this fall. He’d just returned to the family’s dingy second-floor apartment in Aurora, Ill., from the warehouse where he and his 19-year-old daughter, Sham, sorted boxes. At work, Mahmoud tried to keep her in sight. ‘‘I saw how tired she was,’’ he continued. ‘‘It’s more than she can take.’’ Sham’s English classes provided only a shaky foundation in the language, and she struggled to negotiate basic conversations. Mahmoud also spoke little English — we were sitting with an interpreter — but he could manage the essential. Mahmoud work tomorrow, Mahmoud no work tomorrow, he said in self-parody. But he, too, was tired. He rolled up his sweatpants to reveal a swollen leg. In Syria, Mahmoud, 57, who once owned a flourishing locksmith business in the Emirates, would have already retired. ‘‘We didn’t expect it to be so expensive,’’ he said of life in Aurora, an industrial river town 41 miles from Chicago, where the al-Haj Alis arrived in March. ‘‘What can we do?’’ The federal government and the nine nongovernmental agencies that help to relocate refugees in the United States select cities like Aurora because housing and jobs are readily available and the cost of living is relatively low. The al-Haj Alis also receive help with the rent from a local organization, the Syrian Community Network. Still, it isn’t enough. Mahmoud and his wife, Azizeh, had been counting on their son Waseem, who is 27 and trained as a psychologist, to help support the family. His wife, Noorhan, and their two young sons were supposed to be in Aurora, too. But, at the last minute, something went wrong with their application to resettle in America. Now they were stuck in Jordan. Mahmoud flipped through the spiral notebook in which he calculates monthly expenses: Internet, $52; garbage collection, $40; rent, $1,125; repayments on the United States government loan for the plane tickets from Amman to America, $172. Mahmoud went into his and Azizeh’s bedroom and found the bill for the family’s airfare: $6,130. ‘‘Since I used to own a business, I like to record everything,’’ he said. Most nights, Mahmoud works at the warehouse until 11 before returning home with Sham. The al-Haj Alis’ sons Ahmad and Mohamed arrive home around then, too, from six-hour after-school shifts at a local supermarket. Although they’re twins, the boys, 17, dress and act as if they weren’t. Mohamed, curls stiffened with gel, favors a tie. Ahmad, an artist, is often bed-headed and prefers sweatsuits. Every day he tucks a Syrian flag into his waistband before heading to West Aurora High School, despite the occasional trouble the flag invites. At the supermarket, he mans the cash register; he likes to interact with customers, in part to show off the Syrian identity to which he clings. Mohamed, who is shyer and speaks far less about Syria, prefers to herd the stray carts in the parking lot. Now, collapsed on the couch, the twins scrolled through homemade videos of Ahmad strolling around their new neighborhood in sunglasses and found footage showing the rubble of their hometown, 6,000 miles away. The al-Haj Ali family comes from Khirbet Ghazaleh, a town of 16,000. It is 15 miles from Daraa, where the revolution against Assad began, in 2011, after his security forces arrested and tortured a group of students for writing antigovernment slogans. The al-Haj Ali twins were only 13 at the time. They had nothing to do with the protests. Nor did anyone else in the immediate family. Although they listened to news reports of the Assad government’s ferocious attacks on civilians, they saw little indication, at first, of the violence around them. There was the odd black helicopter in the sky. And once, when Waseem was taking Azizeh to driving school, they watched a group of protesters carrying olive branches stream out of Daraa. Only later did they realize these were people fleeing a massacre by Assad’s forces. Then the airstrikes began. Government security forces raided the family’s home dozens of times. Their cousins, who lived next door, were imprisoned and tortured. Still, the al-Haj Alis hung on; they adapted to living in a war zone, spending evenings in the dark. Then, one morning in August 2012, they learned from a television news report that Azizeh’s brother, a high-ranking official in Assad’s military, had defected overnight to Jordan. His family would most likely be punished, with death, in his stead. He hadn’t warned them. He couldn’t: His phone was bugged, and sending a message would only have further endangered them. The al-Haj Alis never slept at home again. Within days, they left Syria for Jordan by car. Azizeh feared they’d be unable to make it across the border and was even more terrified that the names of her family members would be on a blacklist and that they would be arrested. Mahmoud handed their keys to a neighbor whose house had been flattened by airstrikes. ‘‘If we’re not back by sunset,’’ he told her, ‘‘you can have our house.’’ The war scattered the al-Haj Alis across the globe. Mahmoud, his wife, the twins and Sham made it to Aurora after a 30-month stay in Amman, Jordan. Two elder daughters, Rasha and Ruba, are in the Netherlands. Rasha arrived with her husband two years ago, and this fall Ruba followed. She and her three boys fled first to Morocco, then to Spain by boat, making their way on foot to an asylum center in the Nether­lands, sharing a single room with two other families. (Ruba would like to bring her sons to America, but now that they are in a safe country, there is little chance of resettlement in the United States.) A third daughter, Rana, recently gave birth in Egypt; her 1-month-old is officially stateless. Another, Fatimah, is in Jordan. Yet the child of greatest concern to the family is their adult son, Waseem. The al-Haj Alis worry he may never make it to Aurora. The family had been in Illinois for eight months when ISIS attacked in Paris, killing 130 people. Early reports claimed that one of the terrorists made his way to Europe by posing as a Syrian refugee. European countries imposed new border restrictions, and 31 American governors, including the governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, called for a moratorium on Syrian refugees. In December, when a militant couple shot up a center for the disabled in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14 and earning accolades from ISIS, the rhetoric grew more vociferous. A store clerk was shot in Michigan, a Somali restaurant was set ablaze in North Dakota and anti-Muslim hate crimes spiked around the United States. Azizeh wondered if she had brought her sons from Syria only to put them at risk in America, and if Waseem would ever join them now. The al-Haj Alis are five of the 2,647 Syrian refugees who have been resettled in the United States, roughly 0.06 percent of the more than 4.5 million driven from the country since the uprising began in 2011. The scale of the crisis is such that of the 20 million refugees flooding the world today, one in four is Syrian. Although President Obama has committed to bringing at least 10,000 more Syrians to the United States by this October, that number is still a trickle compared with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s effort to resettle 25,000 in Canada; Chancellor Angela Merkel’s acceptance of nearly 93,000 in Germany last fall; and President François Hollande’s promise to bring 30,000 more Syrian refugees to France over the next two years. Why has the United States taken so few? ‘‘It’s extremely difficult to get into the United States as a refugee — the odds of winning the Powerball are probably better,’’ says David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, which helps place refugees from 40 countries in American cities. And Syrians are subject to an extra degree of vetting. Although all refugees are screened by the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I., the Defense Department, the State Department and United States Customs and Border Protection, among other intelligence agencies, Syrians must complete what is known as the Enhanced Syrian Review. This is an added screening by caseworkers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington, which assesses each Syrian case and selects some for processing through the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate office. This extra step was put in place because of the difficulty of assessing the allegiances of the various rebel groups in Syria’s continuing war — what Barbara Strack, chief of the Refugee Affairs Division at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, describes as ‘‘the myriad actors and dynamic nature of the conflict.’’ Until recently, Syria’s refugees were not a pressing domestic political concern. To many Americans, the war in Syria seemed remote, a problem for Syria’s neighbors. Of greater import were the 11 million immigrants who had entered the United States illegally. Then last summer, images of the Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi lying dead on the Turkish shore mobilized American sympathies in favor of refugees, and the Obama administration found itself faulted for admitting so few. Quietly, President Obama directed Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, to work with the State Department to find out why vetting for Syrian refugees required 18 to 24 months. McDonough, known for urging Obama to be cautious in engaging militarily in Syria, took the issue of refugees personally. As a Catholic growing up in Stillwater, Minn., the 10th of 11 children, he worked with his church to help arriving Vietnamese refugees. Now, carrying a stack of charts and graphs, he met with refugee advocates and members of Congress to learn about the pitfalls and procedural bottlenecks within the resettlement program and to study potential means of bringing Syrians more quickly to the United States without compromising on security. In closed-door National Security Council meetings last year, he advised State Department officials to lift bureaucratic hurdles. As a result, the United States has opened up refugee-processing centers in new locations that refugees can actually reach, including one in Erbil, in northern Iraq. By streamlining the process of resettling Syrian refugees, the Obama administration also hoped to demonstrate support for its European allies. ‘‘It’s important to the president’s view to show our allies overseas, who are taking a considerable influx of Syrians, that we support them and we’re doing our part,’’ McDonough told me recently. Paris threatened to change everything. The Syrian passport found near the body of one mili­tant turned out to be a fake, but at least two of the attackers had exploited the refugee routes from the Middle East to Europe. Overnight, the global good will toward refugees that had been building all but vanished. Suddenly, the images of hundreds of thousands of refugees heading north inspired not empathy but alarm. According to the Soufan Group, a New York-based company that provides security-intelligence services, between 27,000 and 31,000 foreign fighters have gone to Iraq or Syria since the start of Syria’s civil war, the vast majority to fight alongside ISIS. At least 10 percent have headed back home. What once seemed like a trickle of vulnerable civilians now looked, to some, like a potentially dangerous flood. Republican presidential candidates seized on the Syrian refugee issue as proof that Obama wasn’t keeping Americans safe. Dr. Ben Carson conflated Syrian refugees with ‘‘rabid dogs.’’ Jeb Bush called for deprioritizing Muslim refugees from the Middle East in favor of Christians. Senator Ted Cruz echoed this sentiment, proclaiming that Muslims should be sent to ‘‘Muslim-majority’’ countries while ‘‘Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them.’’ Donald Trump upped the ante by calling for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. In November, Republicans and some Democrats rallied behind House Bill 4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, introduced by Representative Michael T. McCaul of Texas to slow the arrival of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the United States. Days before the House vote, McDonough and Jeh Johnson, secretary of homeland security, briefed members of Congress on the Syrian-refugee-resettlement program and its screening process, in an attempt to reassure them that such a measure was unnecessary. The House nonetheless voted in favor of the bill, and as 2015 drew to a close, the Syrian refugee issue was at risk of becoming part of the year-end omnibus bill amid discussions of a government shutdown. In the face of mounting political opposition, the president, in a choreographed Trudeau-esque gesture at the National Archives in Washington, welcomed 31 people from 25 countries at their citizenship ceremony. In private, McDonough rang up supporters and opponents alike. ‘‘Every phone call I’ve had with my friends on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democrat, and with governors around the country, I’ve underscored that we recognize the fear,’’ McDonough told me. He spoke of the need to ‘‘send a message’’ to ‘‘the Assad regime and to ISIL that the United States will continue to play the role that it has, that the world has become accustomed to it playing — mainly the role of alleviating suffering at the source and of being a refuge for the most vulnerable people.’’ The Syrian crisis is often described as a crisis of migration, but that’s not how it began. ‘‘This exodus didn’t come out of nowhere,’’ says Dr. Zaher Sahloul, senior adviser for the Syrian American Medical Society. The war in Syria has left some 250,000 people dead and displaced millions. And Syrian-American activists often refer to it as Obama’s Rwanda. ‘‘From Day 1 of the Syrian catastrophe,’’ says Bassam Barabandi, co-founder of the organization People Demand Change, ‘‘the U.S. started signing checks to the U.N., but they missed the point.’’ The point, he said, is ending the war, not creating a welfare state made up of refugees. ‘‘It’s not a zero-sum choice,’’ Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Blinken, who served as Obama’s national security adviser before returning to the State Department, where he began his career, has been asked by the White House to handle the thorny refugee issue. ‘‘We’re working 36 hours a day to solve the war in Syria,’’ he said, ‘‘but meanwhile, what do you do about the huge immediate challenge of more than four million people displaced from their country?’’ For millions of Syrians, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have become vast waiting rooms. ‘‘The two biggest drivers of onward migration are lack of access to education and lack of access to work,’’ Blinken told me recently, at the United States Embassy in Amman. The United States frequently trumpets the fact that of the countries donating to the United Nations in support of Syrian refugees, it gives the most aid, much of it going to front-line countries. But this is in part a self-serving strategy. The United States supports Syria’s neighbors so that they can withstand the pressures of millions of additional people. Refugees place a large burden on natural resources and social services. As a result, relations between Syrians and their hosts are souring. (Jordanians, groaning under the burden of 633,000 refugees, joke darkly that they live ‘‘between Iraq and a hard place.’’) Part of American strategy in the region has been to ease tensions between Syrians and their hosts. The United States provides services (schools and hospitals) for the refugees as well as for the citizens of host countries. They also allocate money for development to keep the host country happy. In Jordan, Blinken had just attended a falafel lunch with Jordanian venture capitalists who started a fund, with United States government support, to incubate technology start-ups. Resettlement in the United States, however, remains a political challenge. ‘‘This is where ISIL neatly joins the problem,’’ Blinken said. ‘‘Very few of the refugees we admit are young males without families — we focus on women, children, the sick and those vulnerable to violence. But you now have this new concern that these refugee populations will somehow be infiltrated by terrorists.’’ In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, European countries hardened their stance on refugees, making illegal migration more difficult by closing borders. (For the first time in 50 years, for instance, those crossing between Denmark and Sweden have to show photo ID.) Turkey is under pressure to do the same. Recently, after receiving promises of $3.25 billion in aid from the E.U., Turkey reportedly arrested 1,300 asylum seekers trying to cross the sea to Greece. The refugees already in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan are more likely to be stuck there, which means that a humanitarian crisis is becoming an economic-development problem. Syrians, many of whom lived sophisticated lives, are often unable to access even the most basic services. ‘‘These are people who had microwaves and cars, and now they’re in tin boxes in the desert,’’ says Jonathan Campbell of the World Food Program. The key factor in their migration is hopelessness. This past fall, the W.F.P. sent text messages to 230,000 Syrians living in Jordan to tell them that their food benefits were going to be substantially reduced because of lack of funding and donor fatigue. (They were later restored.) Although the United States made a large pledge, other countries, facing financial crises at home, did not. As a result, 64 percent of the refugees told the W.F.P. they were going to be forced to leave the country. One family out of every four took a child out of school to work. ‘‘It’s not a pull factor that makes them move, it’s a push factor,’’ says Myriam Baele, head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees’ refugee-resettlement unit in Jordan. ‘‘If there isn’t a means to survive here, they will go,’’ she went on. ‘‘Either to Europe or back to Syria, where they will die.’’ Waseem al-Haj Ali and his wife, Noorhan, keep two blue suitcases packed in the apartment they once shared with their family in Amman. ‘‘It’s a nightmare,’’ Waseem said on a recent evening. ‘‘There’s no future here in Jordan. I can’t even get a driver’s license.’’ In exasperation, he raised his eyebrows, bushy like his father’s. The apartment’s peeling walls were covered in blue and purple flowers, drawn by his brother Ahmad before he left for America. Early last spring in Amman, when the al-Haj Alis were all still together, Waseem, Noorhan and their sons, who are 4 and 2, cleared the Enhanced Syrian Review and completed four days of cul­tural-orientation classes — which include everything from pictures of what to pack (warm clothing and money) and what not to (weapons and illegal drugs) to the importance Americans place on such concepts as punctuality and pri­vacy. These courses are offered only to those who are in the process of resettling in the United States. Noorhan, who had been studying in Syria to become a teacher and whose dark eyes glitter with an easy intelligence, paid special attention to the weather. ‘‘Arizona is like the gulf,’’ she recalled learning. ‘‘Hot, dry and full of snakes.’’ Ten days before Waseem and his family were scheduled to leave, they had completed everything but their medical exams. Then they received a call from the Americans: They couldn’t go just yet. Something had come up in their security clearance, Waseem recalled being told. In retrospect, Waseem’s parents wonder if they should have waited for him. The plan had always been for Waseem to support the family: Azizeh had three ruptured disks and needed back surgery; Mahmoud had an old leg injury. But if the al-Haj Alis had delayed and lost their place in line, they might never have gotten to America. Waseem now feels guilty that he encouraged them to go ahead. He wasn’t sure his parents could make it without him. ‘‘I’m trying to be patient for my parents,’’ he said. ‘‘If it weren’t for them, I would’ve already left.’’ ‘‘If we don’t get a call from the Americans before smuggling season begins in the spring, we’ll leave for Europe,’’ he went on. The last thing he and his wife wanted to do was take two toddlers over the sea. Like everyone else, they had seen the photos of Alan on the beach. Their children couldn’t swim, and neither could Noorhan. But what choice did they have? ‘‘We think only about traveling,’’ he said. ‘‘All we want is to go the United States.’’ Day after day, he checked the news on Facebook and chatted with his mother in Aurora. ‘‘We hope to live in a simple house, with a car outside, and just to watch our kids grow up,’’ Noorhan said. ‘‘That’s it. We don’t want a palace or some luxury life.’’ When the rest of his family left in March, Waseem thought he would have to wait for about a month at the most. One month was now eight. As it grew colder, he stopped walking along the highway looking for illegal construction jobs. The market for day laborers was drying up. He didn’t dare ask for work in the strip of neon-lit shawarma stands downtown, even though many were staffed by fellow refu­gees. If he was caught working, Waseem could be imprisoned, transferred to the refugee camps, where only the poorest of the poor live, or sent back to Syria. Still, he had to find a way to pay the $247 rent on the apartment he once shared with his parents. He and Noorhan relied increasingly on whatever Mahmoud could send back from America. Instead of helping to support his parents, he was taking from them. ‘‘My father used to be a wealthy man,’’ Waseem said, recalling Mahmoud’s locksmith business in Abu Dhabi. Once the war began, Mahmoud sold the business for $120,000. For nearly five years, that money supported more than a dozen family members in five different countries. Now the money was gone. Among Syrian refugees, ‘‘on hold’’ is the most dreaded category. It is extremely difficult to get clear answers about why the hold has been applied or when it will be lifted. To try to learn more, Waseem designated The New York Times as a third party with the legal right to inquire about his case. In response to an email from The Times in November, the International Organization for Migration would say only that Waseem’s case ‘‘is currently on hold pending further review by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.’’ Officials cannot comment on individual cases, but when briefed on the case as a hypothetical, immigration officers and resettlement experts offered several possible explanations: It could be as simple as an applicant’s security clearance having expired while a family member waited to be vetted. Or maybe Waseem’s name sounds like a name on a terrorist watch-list. Or maybe, at the very last minute, ‘‘recurrent vetting’’ raised a red flag. Recurrent vetting, which began in 2015, checks names through a series of databases right up to when the flight lands in the United States. As a senior intelligence officer with the National Counterterrorism Center described it: ‘‘If you have an 800 credit score and you’re good for a new Visa card, and two weeks from now they find out that, hey, two years ago, you changed your name to cover up a prior bankruptcy, then they can take away that card.’’ Or maybe it was Azizeh’s brother. As a former military member of the Assad regime, he might still count as a black mark. Even though he defected early on, he could, by some bureaucratic oversight, still be designated a security risk to the United States. When reached in Qatar this fall, via Skype, he expressed relief that all of his family had made it out of Syria alive. He, too, was searching for a new country. ‘‘I’m not looking for beauty or history,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m looking for a country with human rights and freedom.’’ Other family members described specific questions regarding Azizeh’s brother posed to them by American immigration officers in Jordan. For example, did they serve him coffee or tea when he was in their homes? This was most likely a question to determine whether the family had provided material support — which could include a cup of coffee, a glass of water, a ride — to someone designated to be an enemy of the United States. As months passed with no answers, Waseem turned over the strange questions he was asked during his final interview. Could these hold the key to the predicament in which he now found himself? Did he intend to commit terrorism in the United States? No. Did he intend to visit a prostitute in the United States? No. Refugees often refer to questions like the last one as ‘‘the crazy questions,’’ a senior immigration official told me: queries that, by law, immigration officials must ask to determine grounds of inadmissibility, even though they’re anachronistic. Others include Are you a member of the Nazi Party? and Are you a habitual drunkard? The system of vetting refugees was first overhauled after Sept. 11. Since then, America’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and conflicts in Africa and Asia have led to further refinements in how the United States evaluates refugees. Since 2007, for instance, the Defense Department has worked with the Homeland Security Department to share its intelligence on Iraqis, who represent one of the largest influxes of refugees to the United States in the last decade (more than 85,000 since 2008). Many won the right to apply for admission to the United States after risking their lives to aid American soldiers. Yet, as these Iraqis began to arrive, opposition to resettling them was swift. It began, for the most part, with fringe groups. Ann Corcoran, a conservative from rural Maryland, started a blog called Refugee Resettlement Watch, in which she chronicles news re­lated to Muslims and others arriving in the United States. She warns that Muslims are coming to build ‘‘cities within cities’’ and to establish Shariah law in America. Corcoran told me that in Iowa last spring, she handed her book, ‘‘Refugee Resettlement and Hijra to America,’’ directly to Donald Trump. Resettling refugees isn’t a perfect process. ‘‘No immigration program is completely without risk,’’ a senior intelligence officer says. Yet over more than a decade, the United States agencies involved in the program have learned to communicate more effectively. ‘‘We got a lot smarter and developed additional relationships with the intelligence community beginning with the large-scale Iraqi processing in 2007,’’ Strack, of U.S.C.I.S., says. She adds, ‘‘We are the opposite of stove-piped — we’re incredibly networked.’’ One common misconception about how a Syrian refugee comes to America is that she simply approaches the United States Embassy in Jordan or Turkey or wherever she first lands. This is not how resettlement works. To be legally designated a refugee, she must first apply to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. U.N.H.C.R. takes a photograph and scans her iris. Verification can take anywhere from a couple of months to a few years before she’s interviewed in person. Although these interviews aren’t considered security vetting, caseworkers are trained to eliminate those who may be lying, as well as those who have persecuted others or may be war criminals. In addition to collecting biometric data like iris scans and photographs, U.N.H.C.R. case officers are trained in basic facial recognition and have 2-D screening capabilities to detect fake passports. The goal is to make sure people meet the criteria of the refugee convention, established after World War II. They’re also experts in country-of-origin information. ‘‘Listen, I know where your school is, I know the colors of its walls,’’ one U.N.H.C.R. officer says. ‘‘We detect lies based on what’s happened in the country of origin. It’s not just hour-by-hour events; it’s ethnicity, region, family. We know the custom — we know what their dresses look like.’’ U.N.H.C.R. then advocates for the most vulnerable 10 percent; the other 90 percent will have to make a new life as best they can. Of the 20 million refugees worldwide, less than 1 percent will be officially resettled, and of those, the United States takes about half. Resettlement is only one of three options. The others are returning home (which, for most Syrians, is impossible) or remaining in the host country (which, given the pressures Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon are under, is becoming increasingly difficult). Those either barred or ‘‘deprioritized’’ include individuals with certain military ties, as well as families with missing members. This is to guard against the possibility that the missing member may be fighting alongside an anti-American group like ISIS and later try to rejoin his family. Syrians, like other refugees, don’t choose the country they end up in. U.N.H.C.R. selects the best option based on various criteria specified by host countries, like those from the most vulnerable groups or victims of torture. But there are limits to the requests countries can make. ‘‘We’re not a labor department,’’ a senior U.N.H.C.R. official said. ‘‘If countries come to us asking for a particular religion, we don’t encourage that.’’ All of this takes place before U.N.H.C.R. refers the case to any one country. Once U.N.H.C.R. provides a complete file to the United States, then the applicant’s entire family visits the State Department’s Resettlement Support Center for a prescreening interview. At this point, each individual is run through several databases, including ones at the Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I. and the Department of Defense, and entered into the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System, which warehouses the data and facilitates interagency screening checks. A pilot program will soon include iris scans, which are currently used by U.N.H.C.R. only for identification, not security purposes. This fall, in several closed-door classified briefings before Congress and in public hearings, Anne C. Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, defended the rigorous vetting process. Of the more than 784,000 refugees who have been admitted to the United States in the last 14 years, five have been arrested on terrorism-related charges: One was an Uzbek man arrested in Idaho; the other four were refugees from Iraq. Such mistakes have provided fodder for those who worry that the country is exposing itself to needless risk. ‘‘ISIS has vowed to send its operatives into the West posing as refugees,’’ says McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. ‘‘The threat is real.’’ Advocates say that the threat of a refugee being a terrorist is statistically negligible. ‘‘We don’t leave holes, and we don’t take chances,’’ Richard told me. ‘‘If there’s any doubt about someone, they don’t come.’’ Indeed, as León Rodríguez, director of U.S.C.I.S., recently testified in Congress, the United States has barred 30 individuals from entering ‘‘based on their showing up in the databases.’’ (When queried, a senior intelligence official would say only that there were individuals of ‘‘national security concern.’’) Emily Gray, the executive director in Aurora of World Relief, a branch of the agency assigned by the United States government to help resettle the al-Haj Ali family, says, ‘‘You’d have to be a really stupid terrorist to come this way.’’ After the U.S.C.I.S. officers in Washington conduct the enhanced review, the entire family is scheduled for another interview with a member of the Refugee Affairs Division, a team of 10 to 14 immigration officers from U.S.C.I.S. who spend six weeks on ‘‘circuit rides’’ — traveling up to four times a year to Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and other locations in the region, interviewing refugees being considered for resettlement in the United States. ‘‘Just having an interview doesn’t sound so secure, but this is one heck of an interview,’’ Richard says. ‘‘First off, refugees are people fleeing tyrannical governments, so they may not trust people in positions of authority. They may be used to lying. They have to be prepared to have this interview, and if they’re caught lying, then they’re not going to make it, no matter how worthy.’’ At the end of this process, there are four possible outcomes: immediate acceptance, which is rare and can still involve waiting another 18 months, especially if there is a new marriage or birth; acceptance pending verification; denial; and the limbo into which Waseem al-Haj Ali and his family have now fallen, ‘‘on hold.’’ From Jordan, one afternoon late this fall, Waseem called his mother in Chicago. ‘‘How are you?’’ he asked. He hadn’t anticipated her reply. She was fine, thank God, she said, but there was something wrong at the twins’ school. The night before, she received a call from the school saying there would be police there the next day and it was fine if the boys stayed home. She wasn’t sure what that meant or if other Syrians had received the same call. Azizeh sent the boys anyway. They survived airstrikes and house-to-house raids by Assad’s security forces; they could face American high school. ‘‘Oh,’’ Waseem said, and hung up. He and Noorhan were taken aback. What if, after all they had endured, his parents or Sham or the twins were hurt in America? Waseem was the one who was supposed to protect them, and all he could do was sit on the couch in Amman and accept handouts from his father. ‘‘The worst thing is this game of waiting,’’ Issam Smeir, a psychologist in Aurora with World Relief who has counseled the al-Haj Alis, says. ‘‘It kills your soul.’’ The situation unfolding at West Aurora High wasn’t quite as Azizeh understood it. Ron Murphy, an assistant principal of operations at the high school, explained that yes, the Aurora police were called in as a precaution (Mohamed even snapped a selfie with an officer). But it had nothing to do with the boys. After a student tweeted his support for Trump and Trump’s stance on immigration, a Twitter war broke out. Even though there was no credible threat, the school took steps to reassure parents and defuse the situation. More than half of the school’s population is Hispanic. The issue was immigration, not Islam, Murphy said. The school district models diversity remarkably; the twins were enrolled alongside Iraqis, Nepalis, Bangladeshis and immigrants from 57 countries in a curriculum for students learning English. Ahmad and Mohamed grumbled about it; these kids were uncool, and they only saw regular Americans during gym class. Outside school, the opposition to Syrian refugees wore on: In nearby Indiana, a Syrian family had to be rerouted to Connecticut because of the governor’s opposition. In an attempt to block the arrival of another Syrian family, Texas sued the International Rescue Committee, the resettlement agency working with that family, as well as the federal government. In Congress, as the year drew to a close, House Bill 4038, which would have barred Syr­ian refugees, at least for a time, never came to the floor of the Senate, nor was it part of the omnibus — a pair of victories for McDonough and the White House. Instead, the mass shooting in San Bernardino refocused national security concerns on the visa-waiver program, which the administration had long seen as a problem. In January 2016, even as rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, key players in the war in Syria, imperiled upcoming cease-fire negotiations at the U.N. The Senate stood poised to consider new legislation that would halt the arrival of Syrian refugees. ‘‘We cannot stand by while jihadists try to exploit humanitarian programs to reach our shores undetected,’’ Michael McCaul, who sponsored 4038, said, citing serious screening gaps. Senator Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, who recently introduced a similar bill in the Senate, also supports such legislation. ‘‘Reputable media outlets are uncovering examples of how terrorists infiltrate the Iraq and Syria refugee programs in an effort to commit acts of violence against the American people and our allies,’’ Kirk said. ‘‘Common sense requires thoughtful measures to keep Americans safe.’’ One winter afternoon, not long after the incident at the boys’ school, Azizeh nursed a cup of tea and talked bleakly of the family’s future. What if the governor had the power to keep Waseem out of Illinois? And if he couldn’t come, what would they do? Then there were the boys. ‘‘I’m worried someone will target them,’’ she said. She also worried about herself and Sham. The long coats and hijabs they wore when they went out might attract the wrong kind of attention. Sham had come to America at the worst age possible. At 19, she wasn’t eligible to attend high school, and her English was too poor to pursue her dreams of becoming a lawyer. ‘‘That’s too expensive,’’ Sham said. ‘‘It would take too many years.’’ To secure a future for her, her parents had accepted the marriage proposal of an Iraqi used-car salesman named Layth Alali, Azizeh told me. Fifteen years older than Sham, Alali came to the country on a much-coveted Special Immigrant Visa in 2010, as part of the group of Iraqis who had worked with the United States military. (In Baghdad, he was the head of a checkpoint set up by the Americans.) The whole thing was rushed; he had asked just two weeks earlier, and the engagement ceremony was taking place immediately. After picking Sham and Azizeh up in a BMW S.U.V., Alali drove them to a prom-dress shop in Aurora, and they had less than an hour to find a dress. Sham picked out a spangled strapless confection, but Azizeh worried it exposed too much flesh. ‘‘Problem, problem, problem,’’ she said, pointing to her daughter’s bare neck, arms and shoulders. In the end, she snapped a picture and sent it via WhatsApp to her daughter-in-law, Noorhan, who was, as usual, sitting idle in the apartment in Jordan. A few seconds later, Noorhan sent back a smiley-face emoji with hearts for eyes. The dress, however flawed, was a yes. In a life marked by disappointment and compromise, Azizeh remarked, what did the dress really matter? As a married woman, Sham would be more secure, and so would her family. At least, Azizeh said, Sham would no longer have to work in the office-supply warehouse. The family had other concerns. The boys needed hundreds of dollars of dental work that Medicaid didn’t cover. The al-Haj Alis were struggling to make the rent, and winter was coming, which meant a new bill for heating. Azizeh was trying to figure out what kind of program might help pay the gas bill. As the temperature dropped and it grew dark at 4:30 in the afternoon, Ahmad and Mohamed seemed to be slowing down; Azizeh had to prod them off the couch to get them to work at the market. School was still a challenge. After nearly a year, neither spoke enough English to hold a conversation. Unlike their fellow refugees, who learned English by watching television and American movies, the boys preferred to spend their downtime watching Arabic-language news about Syria or YouTube videos from home. For a long time, when they looked on Google Earth, they could see the debris of their family’s homes, which had been either burned or bombed. Now a mysterious white film obscured satellite images of the town. Was it a glitch, or a security measure on the part of the Assad regime to protect this strategic town, which now serves as a military base? If Ahmad and Mohamed had stayed in Syria, they might be dead by now — either killed by the Assad government’s barrel bombs or fallen among the young men who have joined up with the Free Syrian Army. When one of their friends or cousins fighting with the F.S.A. is killed, the boys study the photographs of his death, often posted on Facebook in tribute, with a mixture of envy and guilt. Issam Smeir, the World Relief counselor, met with the al-Haj Ali family to help them handle the psychological stress of Waseem’s unexpected absence. He was watching for signs of depression in the boys. ‘‘Depression in kids doesn’t look like sadness,’’ Smeir said. ‘‘It looks like restlessness and anger.’’ The biggest argument that Ahmad has had at school involved fellow Syrians who support the Assad regime. The two sides got into a fight over which flag was the true Syrian flag — the one belonging to the Assad regime, or the revolutionary flag that Ahmad tucks into his waistband. ‘‘Students ask about what Syria was like before the war,’’ Ahmad said at home after work one evening. ‘‘We say it was beautiful. It’s kind of baffling how people feel that the value of those who die in France is higher than those who die in countries like Iraq or Syria.’’ That day at school, during their first-period English class, their reading-comprehension portion involved a lesson about Cappadocia, Turkey, where people built an underground city to protect themselves during invasions. Afterward, the teacher handed out work sheets quizzing the kids on what they had learned. Why did people in Turkey live underground? The answer was B: to hide from their enemies. But Ahmad circled C: to live. Three days later, a text came in from Noorhan. More American politicians were opposing Syrians, and what she and Waseem had been reading on Facebook made them think the United States was shutting its borders tighter than ever. It looked as if they were going to have to take their boys over the sea. ‘‘After all the news,’’ she wrote, ‘‘we have no hope to travel to America.’’ Advertisement",2016-01-24 07:00:00,Why Is It So Difficult for Syrian Refugees to Get Into the U.S.? - NYTimes.com,,1,http://nytimes.com

237,http://nypost.com/2016/01/06/florida-university-fires-sandy-hook-truther-professor/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Reuters Submit January 6, 2016 | 1:43pm MIAMI – Florida Atlantic University has dismissed a professor who said massacres at a Connecticut elementary school and a county office building in San Bernardino, California, were staged, the university said. Media professor James Tracy’s last day at the university in Boca Raton will be Friday, the school said in a statement after alerting him of the decision in a letter on Tuesday. Tracy, 50, has worked at the university since 2002. He could not be reached on Wednesday and his attorney, Thomas Johnson, declined to comment. Tracy’s website, MemoryHoleBlog.com, gained notice in 2013 after he claimed the December 2012 massacre by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, was staged by “crisis actors” hired by the Obama administration. The attack killed 26 people, including 20 children. Last month, the university said it would seek to fire Tracy after he sent a letter to the parents of 6-year-old Sandy Hook victim Noah Pozner demanding proof they were his parents. On his blog, Tracy called them “alleged parents” and accused Lenny and Veronique Pozner of fabricating their son’s death certificate to cash in on the tragedy. The Pozners accused Tracy of harassment. “He has shown no remorse and continues to conceive conspiracy theories out of each new mass shooting,” they wrote in a Dec. 10 letter in the Sun-Sentinel newspaper. Tracy also said the San Bernardino incident, in which a militant Muslim couple killed 14 people last month, was a hoax. The university gave Tracy 10 days to respond to its Dec. 16 announcement of his planned firing. He never replied, the school said. The official reason for Tracy’s termination was that he twice failed to submit forms explaining outside activities in order for university administrators to address potential conflicts of interest. “By simply submitting the completed activity form, you would have been compliant with no further discipline,” university Vice Provost Diane Alperin wrote in a letter on Tuesday.

""No,"" the billionaire businessman and former Atlantic City casino tycoon said during the sixth Republican presidential debate in South Carolina. ""No."" ""Look: We have to stop with political correctness,"" Trump continued. ""We have to come down to creating a country that is not going to have kind of problems we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Center, with shootings in California. We have to find out what's going on. I said temporarily. I didn't say permanently."" Trump called for the ban in December in the wake of the Paris attacks and the mass shooting in San Bernardino, which authorities are investigating as a terrorist attack because the Muslim suspects appeared to have ties to terrorist group the Islamic State, or ISIS. The real estate mogul said Muslim immigration should be halted until American leaders ""can figure out what is going on."" The idea drew an immediate backlash, with Democrats and Republicans both saying it was un-American and unconstitutional. But Trump said some of his Muslim friends -- but ""not all"" -- have thanked him for the proposal. ""We have a serious problem,"" he said. ""We can't be the stupid country anymore. We're laughed at all over the world."" Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told Trump that he hopes Trump reconsiders the ban because it would hurt the U.S.'s effort to fight terrorism. ""This policy makes it impossible to build a coalition necessary to take out ISIS,"" Bush said. ""We have to do this in unison with the Arab world."" Trump disagreed. ""I want security for this country,"" he said. ""We have a serious problem with radical Islam."" Brent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @johnsb01.

247,http://www.nationalmemo.com/firing-florida-atlantic-professor-long-overdue/,"By Carl Hiaasen, Tribune Content Agency Florida Atlantic University finally canned the despicable James F. Tracy. After years of embarrassing nut-ball ravings, the associate communications professor was terminated last week for something else entirely. He’s got a union lawyer, and will probably fight to reclaim his job. Despite what he might say, Tracy’s travails have nothing to do with the First Amendment. He can still say or write whatever he chooses. This was about a person on a state university payroll who was behaving abominably, tormenting a family that had already suffered the worst imaginable heartbreak. If such a creature worked for you, you would have fired him a long time ago. Tracy is most infamous for promoting the screwball theory that the 2012 Newtown, Conn., slaughter at Sandy Hook Elementary never happened. He has suggested in blog postings and interviews that the mass shooting was staged by “actors” hired by the Obama administration in order to ignite support for stronger gun regulations. He has made similar idiotic claims about the recent massacre in San Bernardino, the church shootings in Charleston, S.C., and the Navy Yard murders in Washington. To cement his crackpot credentials, he also questioned whether the Boston Marathon bombing was real. Some of these views weren’t only presented online, but shared with his students in the classroom. After Tracy’s Newtown comments stoked an uproar, FAU reprimanded him for not making it clear that his ideas didn’t reflect those of the university. Firing a tenured professor is difficult, and in Tracy’s case FAU didn’t try hard enough. The damage done to its image (and recruiting) is immeasurable, another only-in-Florida saga. It’s one thing to be a Newtown conspiracy freak — the Internet is crawling with these maggots — but Tracy took it farther than most. When the parents of six-year-old Noah Pozner, who was slain at Sandy Hook, asked the professor to remove their son’s photograph from his crazy blog, Tracy responded with a certified letter. In it, he asked Lenny and Veronique Pozner for proof that Noah ever lived, and that they were his parents. Tracy also went after the family on social media. He declared that the Newtown shootings were a “drill” orchestrated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and that nobody was actually killed at the elementary school. A letter bearing Tracy’s name was posted on a Facebook site saying, “The Pozners, alas, are as phony as the drill itself, and profiting handsomely from the fake death of their son.” Whether or not you’ve ever lost a child, the cruelty of those words is almost unfathomable. On Dec. 10 the Sun-Sentinel published an emotional article by the Pozners describing the anguish caused by Tracy’s actions, and questioning why FAU still employed him. The Pozners said it was obvious Tracy had violated the faculty conduct code, adding, “It matters not if (he) simply refrains from mentioning FAU when defaming murdered Americans and their families.” The university finally dropped the hammer, effective last Thursday. Tracy wasn’t sacked for harassing the Pozners, but for failing three years in a row to provide a list of his outside jobs and activities. He’ll probably appeal, basking as he always does in the spotlight. Pathetically, this is as big and important as he’ll ever be. The First Amendment protects unpopular, even loathsome speech, and Tracy remains free to post, blog, print and drool his warped brand of nonsense. Nobody’s shutting him up. While universities ought to be tolerant of controversy and welcoming of all viewpoints, they’re not constitutionally obliged to enable vicious crusades. FAU is a state school in Boca Raton, and Tracy’s $65,000 salary package likely came from lottery funds, student tuition and taxpayers like you and me. Which is only slightly less nauseating to contemplate than his blog. Twenty-six innocent persons were shot to death by a madman three years ago at Newtown. That’s a fact. The children, all ages 6 or 7, were Noah Pozner, Charlotte Bacon, Daniel Barden, Olivia Engel, Josephine Gay, Ana Marquez-Greene, Dylan Hockley, Madeleine F. Hsu, Catherine Hubbard, Chase Kowalski, Jesse Lewis, James Mattioli, Grace McDonnell, Emilie Parker, Jack Pinto, Caroline Previdi, Jessica Rekos, Avielle Richman, Benjamin Wheeler and Allison Wyatt. The grownups, many of whom died trying to save the students, were Mary Sherlach, Victoria Soto, Anne Marie Murphy, Lauren Rousseau, Dawn Hochsprung and Rachel D’Avino. These were real people, all loved and now gone. This isn’t a theory. It’s a horrible, indelible truth borne every day by their families, and exploited by execrable trolls such as Tracy.

249,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/president-obama-sets-contrast-trump-and-so-does-the-gop-response," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows President Obama delivered a forceful State of the Union address Tuesday night in which he defended his record, set the stage for a Democratic successor to carry on his work, and -- above all -- warned Americans to steer clear of Donald Trump’s bullying nativism. The president isn’t on the ballot in 2016, and he made only passing references to the election. But the race was clearly on the president’s mind and he will undoubtedly loom large in it. Hillary Clinton is currently pitching herself as the last line of defense for the president’s achievements while every Republican is running on a pledge to tear them down. In many ways, the speech functioned as a point-by-point rejoinder to the long list of attacks Republican candidates have levied against his administration during the presidential race. It was almost as if, after a yearlong Friars Club Roast, the president finally got to take the podium and rebut his tormentors. “[A]ll the talk of America’s economic decline is political hot air,” Obama said at one point. “So is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.” RELATED: Why there was an empty seat at Obama’s final State of the Union He was loose, dispensing with formality to go off script to offer “tips” to those campaigning in Iowa, mock critics who deny climate change and lament Washington’s partisan deadlock. He took credit for gas falling under $2 a gallon, for the 14 million jobs created under his watch and for the falling deficit. In doing so, he offered a blueprint for the next Democratic nominee to defend his record. But there was a deadly serious undercurrent to the speech, especially when it turned to the politics of Trump, whose rise appears to have genuinely shaken the president. Without ever mentioning his name, Obama repeatedly decried the billionaire’s hostile rhetoric and proposals regarding immigrants and Muslims as an empty, misguided and un-American response to the challenges faced by the country at home and abroad. The president recounted a long line of politicians across many eras “who told us to fear the future, who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control,” and were ultimately rejected by history. He urged Americans to “reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion” and said that doing so was not “political correctness,” a clear reference to Trump’s defining buzzword. “When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn’t make us safer, that’s not telling it like it is: It’s just wrong,” the president said. “It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.” In taking on Trumpism, Obama acknowledged Americans’ frustration, but urged them to direct it elsewhere when it came to presidential politics. Specifically, he asked them to look toward reining in the Wall Street investors, corporations and big money conservative donors that the Democratic field is targeting in their own campaign speeches. “Food Stamp recipients didn’t cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did,” Obama said. ""Immigrants aren’t the reason wages haven’t gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.” Always keenly aware of history and his place in it, Obama acknowledged his failure to prevent the current dark turn in politics while warning that it still had to be confronted. ""It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency — that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,” he said, even suggesting that a greater president like Abraham Lincoln or Franklin Delano Roosevelt might have done better. With reasonably strong approval ratings and an ability to excite Democratic base voters, Obama will be one his party’s most powerful spokespeople and fundraisers this year. He’s likely to play both elder statesman and attack dog for the party’s nominee and candidates for Congress and governorships. Aware of that power, he’s already begun leveraging it to push Democrats on gun control, warning he will not campaign for any Democrat who does support his gun agenda. Clinton especially has tied herself to Obama’s presidency, promising voters her presidency will Obama-plus. “America is better because of @POTUS' leadership. Proud to call him my friend. Let’s build on his progress,” she said on Twitter just before Obama’s speech. Her top rival for the nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was in the chamber for Tuesday night’s address, has had a more complicated relationship with the president. Much like the liberal base he’s tapped into, Sanders seems conflicted between embracing the president and being disappointed Obama did not go far enough in delivering the change he promised. Sanders’s normally very active Twitter account was silent during the two hours of Obama’s remarks. “Tonight’s speech was important. The president reminded us not to be afraid of change, but to wield it to improve the lives of all Americans,” he tweeted after the speech. It perhaps wasn’t surprising that Obama’s speech was about setting up a contrast with Trump and the politics he represents heading into the election. More shocking was that the Republican response seemed to hit the exact same theme. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a potential vice presidential nominee and the daughter of Sikh Indian immigrants, delivered an impassioned plea for civility that often sounded like a rebuttal to Trump. “Today, we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory,” Haley, a potential vice presidential nominee, said. “During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation.” While calling for a tough line against illegal immigration, she also stressed the importance “welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion.” In recounting her leadership after a mass shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, which included a successful bipartisan effort to remove the Confederate Flag from state grounds, she echoed Obama’s call for a less divisive political conversation. “Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,” she said. “That is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume.” True to that theme, there was a shocking lack of red meat in Haley’s response apart from a token mention of Obama’s “disastrous health care program” and a pledge that Republicans would “ make international agreements that were celebrated in Israel and protested in Iran, not the other way around.” At one point she even asked Republicans to acknowledge that they too had fed Americans’ frustrations with politics: “There is more than enough blame to go around,” she said. The Republican presidential debates are aimed at whipping up primary voters, but the Republican State of the Union response is aimed at a general election audience. In that context, it seems significant that Haley made considerable effort to distance the party from its most strident -- and sometimes, most popular -- political rhetoric. In doing so, she offered perhaps the most vivid preview yet of how a Republican nominee might try to pivot to the center if they can shake Trump in the primaries. Trump, for his part, didn’t seem too caught up in his starring role in the State of the Union across both parties. “The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow lethargic - very hard to watch!” he tweeted. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2016-01-12 23:30:35,Obama warns against Trump,,359084,http://www.msnbc.com/#superglue
250,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obama-takes-gun-reform-cable-news-town-hall," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows President Barack Obama took on the issue of gun reform again at a town hall meeting on CNN Thursday evening, saying that while he respected the Second Amendment the gun sales need to be regulated to ensure the safety of Americans. ""There's nothing else in our lives that we can purchase, where we don't try to make it a little safer if we can,"" Obama said Thursday night at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. The president said other industries, including automakers, medicine companies and makers of children's toys have increased regulations and made improvements to make consumers safer. RELATED: Tragedy of young lives lost pushes Obama to take executive action ""The notion that we would not apply the same basic principals to gun ownership as we do to everything else that we own just to try to make them safer — or the notion that anything we do to try to make them safer is somehow a plot to try to take away guns — that contradicts what we do to create a better life for Americans in every other are of our lives."" Obama also noted that first lady Michelle Obama told him she herself would want a shotgun or a rifle for protection if she lived in an isolated area. He said: ""She was absolutely right."" But he said that his series of executive actions announced this week were not meant to infringe law-abiding Americans from owning guns. The intent, he said, was instead ""to keep guns out of the hands of those who would try to do others harm or try to do themselves harm."" ""I think it's really important for us not to suggest that if we can't solve every crime, we shouldn't try to solve any crimes,"" Obama said. The 8 p.m. ET town hall coincided with the release of an op-ed in The New York Times, just an hour earlier, where the president called gun violence in the United States an ""epidemic."" ""The epidemic of gun violence in our country is a crisis,"" Obama wrote in the op-ed. Obama also said he would not endorse any candidate who did not support gun control measures. ""I will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform,"" he wrote. ""And if the 90 percent of Americans who do support common-sense gun reforms join me, we will elect the leadership we deserve."" In the op-ed, Obama called for ordinary citizens to call on lawmakers to hold the gun industry accountable, and lamented that increased gun reform would not happen during this Congress. On Tuesday in a powerful 30-minute, and at times, tear-filled address to the nation Obama unveiled a series of executive actions aimed at preventing more mass killings. The actions are designed to slow the flood of firearms sales and keep weapons out of the hands of potential gunmen. Obama has increasingly felt frustrated and stymied by congressional inaction on gun policy reform after 20 first-graders and six staffers were murdered three years ago by a gunman with an assault rifle at the grade school in Newton, Connecticut. RELATED: Parents of Sandy Hook support exec. action ""That was the worst day of my presidency, and it's not something that I want to see repeated,"" President Obama said in December 2012, two weeks after Newtown shooting. After other mass shootings in Colorado, Arizona, Texas and South Carolina, Obama repeated his call for beefing up gun control and banning assault weapons — only to be rebuffed by Congress and the NRA. After last year's mass shooting at an Oregon college that left 10 dead, a visibly angry and frustrated Obama complained ""we have become numb to this."" Last month, in only his third address to the nation from the Oval Office, Obama once again decried gun violence. In the meantime, the battle over gun policy has largely moved to the state level. Democrats in blue states, including California, Delaware and Oregon, have passed measures since Sandy Hook to expand background checks and bar the carrying of concealed weapons on college campuses. Governors in conservative-leaning states, meanwhile, have expanded gun rights.

251,http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/op-ed-obama-unveils-executive-action-guns," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows President Obama has taken important action toward stemming the tide of gun death in America. As he rightly noted on Tuesday, far too many innocent people suffer predictable and preventable injury and death because of products that are unregulated and readily available. And as a result, we’ve come to a point in the U.S. gun debate, much like we did in earlier generations with cars and cigarettes, where the common good and public safety have become urgent political issues. For this reason, President Obama’s executive action is highly encouraging, because it sends a message that, while the right to bear arms remains indelible and respected for many responsible Americans, it’s become far too easy for people with histories of criminality, domestic abuse, severe mental illness, and even persons on the no-fly list to obtain lethal weapons. The executive orders that the president announced will make it more difficult for dangerous people to get guns. Among other interventions, the order clarifies the definition of engaged in the business—a term used to determine which sellers are required to obtain federal firearms licenses. This clarification will help law enforcement and prosecutors do what the gun lobby and gun rights proponents have been arguing for: enforce our current gun laws. Tightening this definition will lead to more prosecutions and more convictions, and will stop shady gun sellers from selling guns without background checks. The president also clarified the definition of a high-volume gun dealer. He took this action because small numbers of private gun dealers have been pouring tens of thousands of firearms into the market each year through direct sales, gun shows, and the internet. To this point these interactions have not required background checks, even though the guns exchanged are responsible for an exceedingly high rate of U.S. gun trafficking and gun crime. And perhaps most important, these and other actions will expand the types of transactions that require point-of-sale background checks for firearms. Many pro-N.R.A. politicians and pundits wrongly assert that background checks represent the over-reach of a Democratic “gun-control cult” and that expanding the use of the checks “won’t stop terrorists.” But such claims are highly deceptive. In fact, the background check system stems from the shooting of President Reagan, and was first mandated during a GOP administration as part of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. In their current format background checks generally take only a few minutes to complete, and screen for persons whose names appear in federal and state criminal databases. They thus limit gun sales to, for instance, persons who have been indicted or convicted of felonies or have been subject to restraining orders. For these reasons, background checks may or may not impede terrorists—they were not designed as such—but they are undoubtedly effective in stemming the tide of everyday gun violence that kills 33,000 Americans per year. Indeed, data suggests that states that expand background checks see upwards of 40 percent fewer police shot on the job and women shot by their intimate partners, as well as gun suicides, than states that do not. Experts also believe that expanding and strengthening the background check system will lead to fewer mass shootings. None of these orders will in any way hinder the rights of responsible citizens, the so-called good guys, to purchase as many guns as they wish, or of responsible gun dealers to sell them. Instead, the action will result in more oversight of the oft-hidden economies through which bad guys obtain firearms and use them to commit assaults, robberies, and other crimes. Moreover, the actions will help stem the tide of our national epidemic of gun suicides. As has been widely noted, the executive orders stop short of measures that the president sought after the mass shooting three years ago, and leave a number of loopholes in place as a result. Yet by taking action now, President Obama ultimately takes aim at a larger target: the learned helplessness surrounding gun crime in America. Over 100,000 Americans died because of gun crime over the past decade. And while no one on any side of the contentious gun debate wishes for such tragedy, we’ve been (wrongly) told time and again that our country is too hopelessly divided and polarized to take action. Perhaps, though, what we’ve most needed to break the deadlock, and the cycles of trauma and tragedy and counterproductive blame to which we’ve become far-too-accustomed, is a bold first-step.

Its better-than-expected earnings sent the company's stock up more than 8%, to $813, in after-hours trading immediately after the release of its fourth-quarter and full-year results. At that price, Alphabet's market capitalization would be roughly $559 billion, topping that of Apple, which closed the day with a market cap of $534.7 billion. The last time Google/Alphabet was valued higher than Apple was six years ago, before the first iPad debuted.

Deadly waves hit Chenega four minutes later. (Associated Press) Doggone good news Marietta cop could keep K-9: A retired Marietta police K-9 officer might get to keep his dog after all. City officials said at a news conference on Monday that former K-9 Officer Matthew Hickey, 57, could be made an unpaid ""auxiliary officer"" with the department and keep 5-year-old Ajax even in his retirement. Just last week, however, Marietta city officials had said that state law required them to put the dog up for auction because it's still government property. Hickey hoped to take Ajax with him when he retired in late January after 30 years as a police officer. He said city officials told him he would need to buy the dog, which he raised and trained. He said he came up with $3,500 (what a local police dog trainer told the city that Ajax was worth), but police Chief Robert Hupp wouldn't accept the offer. Hupp and other city officials said that because Ajax is still healthy and young, Ohio law mandates that the dog be sold through a sealed-bid auction. Ohio law does allow cities to sell police dogs to the dog's K-9 officer for $1, but only if the dog can't work any longer. After news broke of Ajax' possible sale, Hickey received an outpouring of support on social media. An online campaign had raised $65,000 for Hickey as of Monday afternoon.

257,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-gun-control-debate-ignores-black-lives,"On a drizzly afternoon in January 2013, almost a month after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 first-graders dead, more than a dozen religious leaders assembled in Washington, D.C. They had been invited by the Obama administration to talk about what the country should do to address gun violence. Vice President Joe Biden had been meeting with victims and advocates all day, and he arrived so late that some in the room wondered whether he would come at all. When he finally walked in, the clergy started sharing their advice, full of pain, some of it personal. “The incidents of Newtown are very tragic,” Michael McBride, a 37-year-old pastor from Berkeley, California, recalled telling Biden. “But any meaningful conversation about addressing gun violence has to include urban gun violence.” McBride supported universal background checks. He supported an assault weapons ban. But he also wanted something else: a national push to save the lives of black men. In 2012, 90 people were killed in shootings like the ones in Newtown and Aurora, Colorado. That same year, nearly 6,000 black men were murdered with guns. Many people viewed inner-city shootings as an intractable problem. But for two years, McBride had been spreading awareness about Ceasefire, a nearly two-decades-old strategy that had upended how police departments dealt with gang violence. Under Ceasefire, police teamed up with community leaders to identify the young men most at risk of shooting someone or being shot, talked to them directly about the risks they faced, offered them support, and promised a tough crackdown on the groups that continued shooting. In Boston, the city that developed Ceasefire, the average monthly number of youth homicides dropped by 63 percent in the two years after it was launched. The U.S. Department of Justice’s “what works” website for crime policy had a green check mark next to Ceasefire, labeling it “effective” — the highest rating and one few programs received. McBride wanted President Obama to make Ceasefire and similar programs part of his post-Newtown push to reduce gun violence. He had brought a short memo to give to White House staffers, outlining a plan to devote $500 million over five years to scaling such programs nationwide. His pitch to Biden that day was even simpler: Don’t ignore that black children are dying too. In response, the vice president agreed urban violence was very important, McBride said. But it was clear that “there was not a lot of appetite for that conversation by folks in the meeting,” McBride recalled. Later, other ministers who worked with McBride would get an even blunter assessment from a White House staffer: There was no political will in the country to address inner-city violence. When McBride spoke to administration staffers again about dramatically increasing money for programs like Ceasefire, he said, “People were kind of looking at me like, ‘Are you crazy?’ No, I’m not crazy. This is your own recommendation. You should do it!” Mass shootings, unsurprisingly, drive the national debate on gun violence. But as horrific as these massacres are, by most counts they represent less than 1 percent of all gun homicides. America’s high rate of gun murders isn’t caused by events like Sandy Hook or the shootings this fall at a community college in Oregon. It’s fueled by a relentless drumbeat of deaths of black men. Gun control advocates and politicians frequently cite the statistic that more than 30 Americans are murdered with guns every day. What’s rarely mentioned is that roughly 15 of the 30 are black men. Avoiding that fact has consequences. Twenty years of government-funded research has shown there are several promising strategies to prevent murders of black men, including Ceasefire. They don’t require passing new gun laws, or an epic fight with the National Rifle Association. What they need — and often struggle to get — is political support and a bit of money. A week after McBride and the other faith leaders met with Biden, Obama announced his national gun violence agenda. He called for universal background checks, which experts say could prevent some shootings. Other key elements of his plan — a ban on assault weapons and funding to put police officers in schools — were unlikely to save a significant number of lives. At the press conference where Obama announced the plan, a diverse group of four children sat on the podium with him: two girls and two boys who had written letters begging the president to do something about gun violence. “Hinna, a third-grader — you can go ahead and wave, Hinna—that’s you — Hinna wrote, I feel terrible for the parents who lost their children. I love my country, and I want everybody to be happy and safe,” the president said. Obama went over the litany of school shootings — Columbine, Virginia Tech, Newtown — and made a brief nod to the deaths of “kids on street corners in Chicago.” But his plan included no money for the urban violence strategies his Justice Department described as effective. His platform didn’t refer to them at all. McBride, who was in the audience, said he was not surprised. He supported the president’s other proposals, and, when it came to urban violence, he had “realistic expectations.” In his fight to save the lives of black men, McBride has kept running up against the same assumption: that “urban violence is a problem with black folk. It’s not a problem for this country to solve.” Gun violence in America is largely a story of race and geography. Almost two-thirds of America’s more than 30,000 annual gun deaths are suicides, most of them committed by white men. In 2009, the gun homicide rate for white Americans was 2 per 100,000 — about seven times as high as the rate for residents of Denmark, but a fraction of the rate for black Americans. In 2009, black Americans faced a gun homicide rate of nearly 15 per 100,000. That’s higher than the gun homicide rate in Mexico. To liberals, gun violence among African-Americans is rooted in economic disadvantage and inequality, as well as America’s gun culture and lax gun laws. Conservatives, meanwhile, often focus on black “culture.” “The problem is not our gun laws,” a member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote last year about Chicago’s murder rate. “Nor is it our drug laws, or racist cops, prosecutors and judges. The problem is black criminality, which is a function of black pathology, which ultimately stems from the breakdown of the black family.” Lost in the debate is that even in high-crime cities, the risk of gun violence is mostly concentrated among a small number of men. In Oakland, for instance, crime experts working with the police department a few years ago found that about 1,000 active members of a few dozen street groups drove most homicides. That’s .3 percent of Oakland’s population. And even within this subgroup, risk fluctuated according to feuds and other beefs. In practical terms, the experts found that over a given stretch of several months only about 50 to 100 men are at the highest risk of shooting someone or getting shot. Firearm homicide rates by race, 1993–2010 (Rate per 100,000 people) Most of these men have criminal records. But it’s not drug deals or turf wars that drives most of the shootings. Instead, the violence often starts with what seems to outsiders like trivial stuff — “a fight over a girlfriend, a couple of words, a dispute over a dice game,” said Vaughn Crandall, a senior strategist at the California Partnership for Safe Communities, which did the homicide analysis for Oakland. Somebody gets shot. These are men who do not trust the police to keep them safe, so “they take matters into their own hands,” he said. It’s long-running feuds, Crandall said, that drive most murders in Oakland. Men involved in these conflicts may want a safer life, but it’s hard for them to put their guns down. “The challenge is that there is no graceful way to bow out of the game,” said Reygan Harmon, the director of Oakland Police Department’s violence reduction program. These insights led a group of Boston police, black ministers and academics to try a new approach in 1996. Since group dynamics were driving the violence, they decided to hold the groups accountable. The plan was simple: Identify the small groups of young men most likely to shoot or be shot. Call them in to meet face-to-face with police brass, former gang members, clergy and social workers. Explain to the invitees that they were at high risk of dying. Promise an immediate crackdown on every member of the next group that put a body on the ground — and immediate assistance for everyone who wanted help turning their lives around. Then follow up on those promises. The results of Operation Ceasefire were dramatic. Soon after Boston held its first meeting — known as a call-in — on May 15, 1996, homicides of young men plummeted along with reports of shots fired. The Rev. Jeff Brown, one of the ministers who worked on the project, remembers people were outside more, barbecuing in the park. At Halloween, kids were able to trick-or-treat on the streets again. The team behind the effort quickly started getting calls from other cities — even other countries — about how to replicate what became known as the Boston Miracle. With the support of the Justice Department under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, many cities tried the strategy and some got dramatic results. Stockton saw a 42 percent reduction in monthly gun homicides over several years. Indianapolis experienced a 34 percent drop in monthly homicides. Lowell, Massachusetts, saw gun assaults fall by 44 percent. A 2012 review of the existing research evidence found that seven of eight cities that had rigorously implemented Ceasefire and similar strategies had seen reductions in violence. Other cities have tried Ceasefire, or half-tried it, and then abandoned it. The strategy requires resources, political buy-in, and ongoing trust between unlikely partners. The effort in Boston had “black and Latin and Cape Verdean clergy working with white Irish Catholic cops in a city that had a history of race relations leading up to that point that was abysmal,” Brown said. “It was really a shift in behavior, in the way we did business.” These partnerships can be fragile. Boston’s own Ceasefire effort fell apart in 2000, researchers said. There was infighting and the police official who led it got another assignment. In subsequent years, homicides of young men crept up again. An endless number of variables can affect crime, making it hard to know how much a particular effort works. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, noted that the current research only evaluates the short-term effects of the program, so it’s still unclear how well it works over the long term. Still, Webster said, if you’re interested in reducing shootings among young black men, the Boston Ceasefire model is one of the strategies that has shown “the most consistent positive response.” Jim Bueerman — head of the Police Foundation, which focuses on crime research — said that while the evidence is only “highly suggestive,” Ceasefire is still worth doing. “It’s going to be a long time before you get the perfect evidence,” said Bueerman, a former police chief of Redlands, California. “When you come across a strategy like Ceasefire that appears to be working, you owe it to people to try it in your local community.” Part of what seems to make Ceasefire effective is that it treats the men it targets as both dangerous and also in need of help. Such initiatives, however, fit into no political camp and thus have few powerful champions. “It has no natural constituency,” said Thomas Abt, a Harvard Kennedy School researcher who has worked on crime policy at the Justice Department. “To vastly oversimplify, progressives want more prevention and conservatives want more enforcement. Focused deterrence” — what academics call Ceasefire and similar approaches — “challenges the orthodoxy on both sides. It makes everybody uncomfortable.” Ceasefire has often been greeted with skepticism in the neighborhoods it’s supposed to help, where residents have reason to distrust the police. To buy into Ceasefire, McBride had to weigh the data against his own experience. In 1999, as a college student studying theology, McBride was stopped as he drove home by two white San Jose police officers. He said they forced him to get out of his car, groped him, and made him lie on the ground while threatening him. It didn’t matter that he was a youth pastor, that he was involved in local politics, that he had just helped to get San Jose’s new mayor elected. That night, he was just another black man lying on the ground. (The police chief at the time told ProPublica that while the officers and McBride gave conflicting accounts, he decided to launch a study of racial profiling during traffic stops, one of the nation’s first.) When McBride moved to Berkeley in 2005, fresh out of divinity school at Duke University, he thought he would focus his social justice work on education — mentoring young people struggling to graduate from high school. Then a few of the young people he was mentoring were murdered. One was Larry Spencer, a charismatic 19 year old — funny, popular, “someone that everyone just really loved,” McBride said. Spencer was shot to death outside a liquor store in nearby Oakland. It was the city’s 39th gun homicide in a year that left 110 dead. Hundreds of mourners attended Spencer’s funeral, McBride said. McBride asked the congregation how many had attended a funeral before. Everyone raised their hands. How many had been to two funerals? Three? Four? He continued to count upward. “I got as high as 10,” he recalled. “Half of the young people started to cry and still had their hands in the air.” Oakland had tried Ceasefire on and off for years but struggled to make it work. “There wasn’t a true commitment to the strategy,” said Lt. LeRonne Armstrong, who managed the city’s program in the mid-2000s while working in the criminal investigations unit. “We did not have the political support.” McBride and others pushed city leaders and pastors to embrace the strategy. Many of them were skeptical, but McBride thought working with the police was crucial. “We realized that in order for us to do any of this work, we were going to have to be in some relation with the police department. We pay taxes. We’re paying for the police department, whether we like it or not,” he said. In 2012, Oakland recommitted itself to Ceasefire. It hired a full-time manager for the program, using both city dollars and part of a 2013 Justice Department grant. The city also dedicated funds to work with a team of experts who had helped other cities implement Ceasefire. The experts  helped Oakland do a detailed data analysis homing in on the men who needed to be called in. There were only 20 guys at the first relaunched call-in — “but they were 20 of the right guys,” said Armstrong. Murders dropped from 126 in 2012 to 90 in 2013, according to police department data. Last year, Oakland had 80 murders. McBride traveled across the country as part of a national campaign to reduce urban violence using Ceasefire. Every city had its own challenges. Money was one of them.  Ceasefire was not particularly expensive, but hiring outreach workers and providing social services to the men involved required a little support, as did hiring outside consultants. Outside funding also made it easier for city leaders to move ahead with a different approach to gun violence. The Obama administration has several grant programs aimed at helping urban neighborhoods reduce violence, but the demand for grants far outstrips funding. For one 2012 grant, the Justice Department received over 140 applications and had money for just 15. “It is a brutal process to apply for these grants. Most of them don’t get funded, and I think that’s a bit of a tragedy,” said Bueerman, the head of the Police Foundation. “You have agencies that are highly willing to do the work. You don’t have to sell them on the efficacy of the strategy. You just have to empower it through a relatively small amount of money to help them get the program started.” The Obama administration has consistently asked for more money than Congress has authorized. In 2012, the White House requested $74 million for five grants for Ceasefire and similar programs. It got $30 million. Advocates of Ceasefire have tried to press Congress for more money. Some legislators “really like these programs,” one former Hill staffer said, but not enough to take on an uphill battle for additional funding. “I think the one sort of antidote to that was if you had massive political pressure from some organization or group that felt really strongly about something and could get people riled up about it,” the staffer said. “Honestly speaking, if we are talking about urban violence, there is less of that.” The national groups that spend the most money and do the most advocacy related to gun violence have concentrated almost exclusively on passing stricter gun control laws. Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said he’s “very supportive,” of strategies like Ceasefire, but “it’s not our lane.” A spokeswoman for Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety said much the same. “We’re focused on what we know, which is how to improve the laws,” said Erika Soto Lamb. Declines in violent crime over the last two decades have made it harder to galvanize support for gun violence prevention. The number of Americans murdered by guns peaked in 1993, then dropped sharply until 2000 for reasons that are still not fully understood. Since then, the number of Americans killed in gun homicides has remained remarkably consistent, about 11,000 to 12,000 a year. Another constant: About half of those killed this way are black men, though they make up just 6 percent of the U.S. population. In 2001, when George W. Bush took office, 5,279 black men were murdered with firearms, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2012, it was 5,947. These deaths are concentrated in poor, segregated neighborhoods that have little political clout. “I think that people in those communities are perceived as not sufficiently important because they don’t vote, they don’t have economic power,” said Timothy Heaphy, a former U.S. attorney who has spent much of his career focused on urban violence. “I think there’s some racism involved. I don’t think we care about African-American lives as much as we care about white lives.” The few congressional efforts to advance gun legislation in recent years have been prompted by mass shootings, violence that is seemingly random and thus where everyone can feel at risk. “Congress has only moved in response to galvanizing tragedy, and galvanizing tragedy tends to not involve urban, run-of-the-mill murder,” said Matt Bennett, a gun policy expert at Third Way, a centrist think-tank. “The narrative about the need for gun violence prevention generally is driven by these black swan events, and those often involve white people,” he added. “It is horrific and tragic, but that’s the fact.” When Adam Lanza shot his way into the Sandy Hook Elementary School with a military-style rifle and handguns in December 2012, it wasn’t clear if any laws would have stopped him. Lanza had taken the guns from his mother, who had purchased them legally. The package of proposed legislation and policy initiatives recommended by the Obama administration in the aftermath of Sandy Hook centered on closing loopholes in background checks and renewing the federal ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004. The president also called for increased spending on mental health, crackdowns on the trafficking networks that sell illegal guns, and more than $150 million for a new program to put more cops and psychologists in schools. Obama and gun control advocates made universal background checks the focus of their push. It wasn’t a policy that was relevant to Newtown, but they saw it as the most likely way to reduce everyday gun violence and save lives. Most researchers agree that a better background check system could help curtail both urban gun violence and mass shootings, though there’s no hard data to indicate how much. There was less evidence proving that the other elements of the president’s plan would reduce gun violence. Though the public quickly focused on one weapon Lanza used, a Bushmaster XM15-E2S, experts knew the assault weapons ban hadn’t saved many lives. The effects of a renewed ban “are likely be small at best, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement,” a report funded by the Justice Department concluded. A former senior White House official agreed. While a ban on high capacity magazines could help some, the official told ProPublica, the assault weapons ban “does nothing.” Though Obama endorsed it as part of the post-Newtown package, “we did the bare minimum,” the official said. “We would have pushed a lot harder if we had believed in it.” Some gun control advocates who worked with the administration on gun legislation said they saw the endorsement of  the assault weapons ban as a bargaining chip. “It’s all a dance, it’s a kabuki thing, and right from the beginning the White House understood that they weren’t going to get a ban done,” said Bennett, the gun policy expert. “They had to talk about it. It would have been insane not to. Every news report after Sandy Hook had this horrible looking AR-15, and noted that it had been a banned weapon that now wasn’t.” Adding police at schools has popular appeal, but classroom homicides are exceedingly rare. “Any given school can expect to experience a student homicide about once every 6,000 years,” said Dewey Cornell, a University of Virginia professor who studies school safety. “Children are in far more danger outside of schools than in schools. If we had to take officers out of the community to put them in schools, then actually children will be less safe rather than more safe.” Two former administration staffers who worked on the gun violence platform said the $150 million proposal for cops and counselors in schools — which “may have been a bit outsized,” one said — was driven by Vice President Biden’s history of championing federal grants for hiring cops. It also seemed like “something that people might be willing to, you know, give us money for,” a former senior White House official said. The staffers said they could not remember why funding to support strategies like Ceasefire was not included in the plan. “Look, if it was some deliberate conversation not to do it, I would remember,” the former senior official said. Though Justice Department grants for community violence prevention weren’t part of the post-Sandy Hook platform, a staffer said “we were watching the fiscal year 2014 budget process and making sure we were continuing to push for those resources at DOJ.” Bruce Reed, Biden’s chief of staff at the time, said budget concerns likely kept funding for innovative local efforts out of the package. “We didn’t want to turn this into an appropriations bill, because that would be … ” he said, shrugging. “That would cost us whatever Republicans we had hoped for.” “The appropriations climate was, if possible, more divisive than the gun debate,” Reed added later. “We were always between shutdowns.” Webster, the Johns Hopkins gun violence researcher, said that it would have been “more justifiable” to devote federal dollars to supporting Ceasefire and similar programs than it was to put the money toward school security. “I don’t know of any evidence that putting police in schools makes them safe, and I do know of evidence that having police in schools leads to more kids being arrested,” he said. Two weeks after Obama unveiled his plan, McBride and dozens of other clergy members, many of them from cities struggling with high rates of gun violence, met again with staffers from Vice President Biden’s task force. The mood at the January 29 meeting was tense. Many of the attendees, including McBride, felt the president’s agenda had left out black Americans. “The policy people working for Biden worked with the reality of Congress,” said Teny Gross, one of the original Boston Miracle outreach workers who now leads the Institute for Nonviolence Chicago. “What they were proposing to us was very limited and was not going to help the inner city.”
Gross said he “blew a gasket.” The clergy members in the room were pleading for help. “We bury hundreds of kids every year in the inner city,” Gross recalled them telling the administration representative. “Some of the solutions need to apply to us.” A staffer said that the political will of the country was not focused on urban violence, several ministers who attended the meeting recalled. “What was said to us by the White House was, there’s really no support nationally to address the issue of urban violence,” said the Rev. Charles Harrison, a pastor from Indianapolis. “The support was to address the issue of gun violence that affected suburban areas — schools where white kids were killed.” The Rev. Jeff Brown, from Boston, was angered by the administration’s calculated approach. “When you say something like that and you represent the President of the United States, and the first African-American President of the United States, you know, that’s hugely disappointing,” he said. Former administration officials said they thought it was tragic that the everyday killings of black children did not get more political attention. “I totally agree with their frustrations,” a former official said. “At the same time, when the nation listens, you’ve got to speak, and you don’t get to pick when the nation listens.” It would turn out there was little political will to realize the administration’s gun-violence proposals either. Measures to expand background checks and ban assault weapons died on April 17, 2013 when they couldn’t muster the votes necessary to advance in the Senate. In his 2014 budget recommendations around the same time, Obama again asked for more money for local grant programs to combat urban gun violence. He recommended tripling the funding for a Justice Department grant that helped cities adopt Ceasefire from $8 million to $25 million. Overall, he requested $79 million for grants to support similar initiatives. Obama had asked for almost twice that much to put more cops and psychologists in schools. Congress slashed Obama’s requests across the board. Instead of approving $150 million to help schools hire cops and psychologists, it created a $75 million school safety research program. It also rejected his proposed increases for Ceasefire and similar programs. Instead, Congress took many of the small grants and made them even smaller. One program was cut from $8 million to $5.5 million. Another shrank from $2 million to $1 million. In all, Congress spent $31 million on five urban violence-related grants — less than half of what it approved for research on how to make schools safer. There have been increasing concerns about rising murder rates over the past year in cities across the country.  Some have blamed the increases on the “Ferguson Effect,” — the theory that increased scrutiny of cops has made them reluctant to do their jobs — although there is “no data” to support this claim, as Attorney General Loretta Lynch said recently. It’s not clear how much murders have increased nationwide. Each city has its own trend. Some have seen an uptick only in comparison to the historic lows they had last year. In other cities, violence is truly spiking. Baltimore  recently recorded its 300th homicide this year, the most since 1999. In Indianapolis, where homicides are set to increase for the third straight year, more federal funding might have made a difference. In early 2012, Indianapolis applied for a Justice Department grant to help implement Ceasefire, requesting $1.5 million over three years. But just four of more than roughly 60 cities that applied received funding. Indianapolis was not among them. “Absolutely, there’s no doubt in my mind, if we had been awarded the grant we would have had the financial carryover to move the program forward,” said Shoshanna Spector, the executive director of IndyCAN, a local faith-based advocacy group that pushed for Ceasefire. Douglas Hairston, who works on private-public partnerships at the Indianapolis mayor’s office, said the city is currently doing “60 to 70 percent” of the Ceasefire strategy. “Federal funds would have helped,” he said.  “We know that we could do more, and we’re striving to find ways to do it.” Earlier this year, Indianapolis Police Chief Rick Hite said the city was doing the strategy “with modifications” and that the city is always using the “tenets of Ceasefire.” There have been 133 murders so far this year in Indianapolis, according to police department data, up from 96 in 2012. In Baltimore, Ceasefire appears to have struggled. The program’s manager resigned in March, the Baltimore Sun reported. Webster, the researcher evaluating the effort, told the paper he questioned whether the rollout of Ceasefire in the Western District was “being done on the cheap and being done in a way that is not even resembling the program model.” Other cities have seen more success. New Orleans and Kansas City both saw drops in violence that researchers have credited to their new Ceasefire programs. Chicago has been rolling out call-ins to an increasing number of police districts. Gary, Indiana, and Birmingham, Alabama, both launched new Ceasefire programs this year. Cities have often paid for the programs using money from a variety of sources: federal dollars, local governments, and, increasingly local foundations. Obama has launched an initiative to support young men and boys of color. One of the stated goals of My Brother’s Keeper, which was launched last year, is reducing violence. The initiative is backed by more than $500 million in corporate and philanthropic commitments. But most of that money has been devoted to mentoring and education programs. Organizers said they would reduce violence, too, albeit indirectly. “I would challenge this notion that violence reduction resources or targeting is only to be looked at through the lens of reducing violence per se,” Broderick Johnson, the chair of the My Brother’s Keeper Task Force, told ProPublica.  “It is just as important to look at it in terms of opportunities for young people to stay in school or get jobs or to get second chances.” Last year, the Justice Department also launched a modest effort called the Violence Reduction Network, which provides cities with training and advice from former police chiefs and other crime-fighting experts. Many of the needs the network meets are basic: It helped Wilmington, Delaware police create a homicide unit. Wilmington, with 70,000 mostly black residents, has a higher murder rate than Chicago. Running the network is inexpensive. It costs about $250,000 per city annually. But once again, it’s not meeting the greater need. The program is targeted at the roughly four-dozen cities with the nation’s highest violent crime rate. The government is only working with 10 of them. The White House did not comment on questions about the administration’s overall response to urban violence. The Justice Department offered the following statement: “In addition to focusing on violent crime reduction in cities, the department also responded to one of the worst mass shootings in our nation’s history in Newtown by identifying funding for school resource officers to help keep kids safe in schools and to assist the many victims of this heinous crime.” Biden’s office also offered a statement: “Whether it’s by banning assault weapons, incentivizing local police to create better relationships with residents of America’s cities, or finding alternatives to jail, including diversionary programs like drug courts, the Vice President has worked to support any viable solutions to reduce gun violence in our cities.” When Jeff Brown was at the White House recently for an initiative on extremism, he ran into Biden. “The vice president walked up to me and said, ‘Reverend Brown, good to see you,’” Brown said. Biden said he remembered meeting Brown back in the ‘90s, when he visited Boston to hear more about Operation Ceasefire and the Boston Miracle. “I hope we can bring back some of what we did in Boston,” Brown said he told the vice president. “I hope so, too,” Biden replied. Brown laughed at the memory. “You’re the vice president — can’t you do something about it?” This story was co-published with The New Republic. Produced by Emily Martinez and Hannah Birch.

Rather than aiming his message at Conservatives, the POTUS sent a direct warning to Democratic presidential candidates saying he will not offer them his support unless they are in favor of gun control. ""I will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform. And if the 90 percent of Americans who do support common-sense gun reforms join me, we will elect the leadership we deserve,"" he pledged.

We need the vast majority of responsible gun owners who grieve with us after every mass shooting, who support common-sense gun safety and who feel that their views are not being properly represented, to stand with us and demand that leaders heed the voices of the people they are supposed to represent,"" Obama continued. On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton responded to Obama's executive actions on gun control via Twitter, saying: ""Thank you, @POTUS, for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next president has to build on that progress -- not rip it away."" ""2016 should be remembered as the year America decided to take on gun violence,"" she wrote in another tweet on Thursday.

""It's become clear that no mass shooting, no matter how big or bloody, will inspire Republicans to put children and innocent Americans over the interests of the NRA. They are simply more loyal to gun lobbyists than our children,"" Sanders said. ""That's why I support President Obama's executive actions to make our communities safer."" Obama also shared some shocking statistics in his New York Times piece, writing: ""Every year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns. Suicides. Domestic violence. Gang shootouts. Accidents. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost brothers and sisters, or buried their own children.

""Change will be hard. It won't happen overnight,"" Obama said. The president ended his op-ed by comparing the fight to end gun violence to the suffragette movement, civil rights, LGBT rights and equal marriage. ""Those moments represent American democracy, and the American people, at our best. Meeting this crisis of gun violence will require the same relentless focus, over many years, at every level,"" he said.

259,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/13/nikki-haley-responds-backlash-republican-response-state-of-the-union-immigration,"South Carolina governor takes heat from prominent conservatives but doubles down on conviction that ‘the fabric of America is based on legal immigrants’ Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.13 BST After calling on Americans to resist the “angriest voices” at a time of great anxiety, Republican Nikki Haley on Wednesday pushed back against the torrent of conservative criticism directed at her official response to the State of the Union. When Haley, a governor of South Carolina, used the Republican response to Barack Obama’s address to appeal for tolerance toward immigrants, supporters of real estate mogul Donald Trump swiftly rallied against the nation’s second Indian American governor.  “Trump should deport Nikki Haley,” tweeted Ann Coulter, the far-right conservative commentator known to make provocative statements. Laura Ingraham, a prominent talk radio host in conservative circles, lamented that Haley missed an opportunity “to stand with working people who want borders enforced”. “The country is lit up w/ a populist fever & the GOP responds by digging in, criticizing the GOP candidates dominating polls?! NOT SMART,” she tweeted. Haley acknowledged that she had Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner, in mind while issuing an emphatic defense of America’s openness to immigrants as one of its “noblest legacies”. “Mr Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,” Haley said on the Today show Wednesday morning. She later stood by her comments when asked about the backlash, telling reporters was simply expressing what she believed. “I think that this country is better when we work together and acknowledge the fact that the fabric of America is based on legal immigrants of all professions, of all races, of all religions,” Haley said. During her response to President Obama’s final State of the Union, Haley spoke of American identity in terms that were strikingly similar to the president. After sharing her tale as the daughter of immigrants, the nation’s second Indian American governor drew upon the example of unity following last year’s racially motivated mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. “We didn’t turn against each other’s race or religion. We turned toward God, and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world,” Haley said. Earlier in her speech, she acknowledged the threats that were the source of widespread fear before offering a clear rebuttal of the overheated rhetoric on the campaign trail. “During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,” Haley said. “No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.” Trump responded by accusing Haley of being “weak on illegal immigration”. While Haley reflected a sympathetic attitude toward immigrants on Tuesday, she has by no means been a lightweight on the issue. Haley was among the dozens of Republican governors in November who requested the Obama administration not resettle Syrian refugees in their states, citing concerns over the vetting process in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris. She also emphasized to reporters on Wednesday the need to be open to legal immigration, but seemed to draw a line at how to deal with immigrants who were in the country illegally. While listing her policy differences with Republican presidential candidates, Haley noted that “Marco Rubio supports amnesty, which I don’t”. The soundbite garnered immediate attention, given Rubio’s support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants remains a key vulnerability for the Florida senator. Over the past year, Haley has nonetheless emerged as a voice of reason in a fractured Republican party. Her response to the Emanuel AME church massacre, in which a white gunman shot and killed nine African American churchgoers, was especially praised by members of both parties. Following the shooting, Haley promptly pushed for removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state house grounds. Her return to national prominence has kicked off fresh speculation that Haley could be a top vice-presidential pick for the Republican ticket in 2016. Her name was similarly floated as a running mate to Mitt Romney in 2012, although she took herself out of contention at the time. South Carolina holds outsize influence over the Republican primary as the third early voting state, and at least one candidate praised Haley’s State of the Union response. At a rally in South Carolina on Wednesday ahead of the next presidential debate, Rubio told voters their governor did “a great job”. In a separate interview with Fox News the night before, he commended Haley’s “tone and her demeanor”. Haley has yet to make any endorsements in the race, but her support could prove influential. The governor’s approval rating, according to recent polling, was just shy of 60%.",2016-01-13 18:22:17,Nikki Haley defends against Republican ire over State of the Union response,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

January 04, 2016 Attorney General Loretta Lynch (left) looks toward President Barack Obama during a meeting with top law enforcement officials to discuss what executive actions he can take to curb gun violence. (Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters/Newscom) Republican lawmakers hit back on President Barack Obama’s plans to unveil a series of executive actions this week aimed at tightening gun laws. Ahead of Obama’s meeting Monday with top law enforcement officials to finalize expanded gun control measures, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the president’s extent of executive overreach “dangerous.” “While we don’t yet know the details of the plan, the president is at minimum subverting the legislative branch, and potentially overturning its will,” Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy criticized Obama on Twitter, writing that his plan “poses a grave threat” to the separation of powers and charged that the president is attempting to “legislate from the executive branch.” Americans have a constitutional right to own firearms. @POTUS doesn’t have a constitutional right to legislate from the executive branch. — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) January 4, 2016  Executive overreach on #2A that President Obama is considering poses a grave threat to our constitutional separation of powers. — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) January 4, 2016  The President is wrong to target our constitutionally protected #2A rights. The American people won’t stand for unilateral executive action. — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) January 4, 2016 Obama met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch Monday to discuss the administration’s options for strengthening gun control after several months of internal legal review. He said the recommendations from his cabinet were “well within” his legal authority and “entirely consistent with the Second Amendment.” “We have to be very clear that this is not going to solve every violent crime in this country, it’s not going to prevent every mass shooting, it’s not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal,” Obama said. For the United States to fully address gun violence, he said, “Congress needs to act.” The key proposal Obama is expected to announce would allow the president to sidestep Congress to require more gun dealers to obtain a federal license and conduct background checks on customers purchasing firearms. The shift would expand the definition of who is considered a firearms dealer under federal law, encompassing a broad number of people who are currently exempt to force more sales on government records. The administration hopes the change will capture unregistered dealers who escape background checks by selling at gun shows, online, and at other venues not covered under law. The White House is also set to implement stricter requirements on reporting lost and stolen weapons, a measure the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives advocated for in 2014 but failed to pursue against gun advocates, who claimed that voluntary reporting was adequate. Ryan said none of Obama’s proposals would have prevented the recent mass shootings in the U.S. and that the focus should instead be on addressing mental illness. “His proposals to restrict gun rights were debated by the United States Senate, and they were rejected,” Ryan said. “No president should be able to reverse legislative failure by executive fiat, not even incrementally.” Congress blocked expanded background checks in 2013. House Republicans said the president’s latest decisions on gun control overstep his authority. Obama’s executive gun orders must be rejected. We are a #ConstitutionalRepublic & Pres. cannot bypass Congress when initiatives are blocked. — Brian Babin (@RepBrianBabin) January 4, 2016  Instead of going against the will of Congress, the President should work w/ us on reforms that would actually reduce violence. — Rep. Bradley Byrne (@RepByrne) January 4, 2016  #Obama‘s means to achieving gun control agenda eroding rule of law, checks & balances that restrain government power https://t.co/aeORN8thMX — Rep. Todd Young (@RepToddYoung) January 4, 2016  Obama revived steps toward enacting steeper gun control measures in October following the fatal shooting at Umpqua Community College that left nine dead. In his weekly address released New Year’s Day, Obama said his 2016 resolution was to move forward on “unfinished business”—specifically, the U.S.’s “epidemic of gun violence.” He is expected to release specific details of the plan during a town hall Thursday at George Mason University. “We know that we can’t stop every act of violence. But what if we tried to stop even one? What if Congress did something—anything—to protect our kids from gun violence?” Obama said. Current law requires anyone who is “engaged in the business” of dealing firearms to be federally licensed, thus requiring the seller to perform background checks. But the law is vague in defining who is considered a gun dealer, exempting anyone “who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.” The administration’s measure would clarify who is considered “in the business” of selling guns, requiring that anyone who sells a specific number of guns register with the ATF and conduct background checks. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Sunday the president’s planned executive actions would undermine the rights guaranteed under the Second Amendment, remarking that Obama has “waged war on the Constitution.” “Law-abiding gun owners are not the problem in this country. The problem are criminals, and criminals don’t care what laws you pass,” Rubio said. “You can pass all the gun laws in the world that you want. It will not stop the criminals.” The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you.

261,http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/05/obama-hey-forget-what-i-said-about-australia-twice-no-ones-looking-to-take-away-your-guns/,"Says the man who promised, “If you like your [health insurance] plan, you can keep your plan,” and who promised to lead a new era of post-partisan comity in his presidency — and then decided to spend years rehashing the gun-control debate that Democrats lost years ago. But Barack Obama insists that gun owners can trust him now when he says if you like your guns, you can keep your guns!  Oh, and stop impugning his motives, all you murder-cheering gun-rights activists, or something: Obama: ""This is not a plot to take away everybody's guns."" https://t.co/YRIuHfsLkh pic.twitter.com/ToaNng4Aab — NBC News (@NBCNews) January 5, 2016  If it’s not a “plot to take away everybody’s guns,” then why does Obama keep bringing up Australia as a model for gun control? It’s not an accident; Obama has mentioned Australia (and the UK, which had a confiscatory policy as well) on several occasions, including last October: We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings.  Friends of ours, allies of ours — Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours.  So we know there are ways to prevent it. And there was this more explicit reference to Australia in the summer of 2014. Charles C. W. Cooke gives the context: “Couple of decades ago, Australia had a mass shooting, similar to Columbine or Newtown. And Australia just said, well, that’s it, we’re not doing, we’re not seeing that again, and basically imposed very severe, tough gun laws, and they haven’t had a mass shooting since. Our levels of gun violence are off the charts. There’s no advanced, developed country that would put up with this.” … In other words, the president of the United States just praised a government for forcefully removing all semi-automatic firearms (i.e. a remarkable number of the guns in America and the majority of those sold today) from its citizenry. Let me be clear, as Obama likes to say: You simply cannot praise Australia’s gun-laws without praising the country’s mass confiscation program. That is Australia’s law. When the Left says that we should respond to shootings as Australia did, they don’t mean that we should institute background checks on private sales; they mean that they we should ban and confiscate guns. No amount of wooly words can change this. Again, one doesn’t bring up countries that have confiscated firearms as a shining example unless one wishes to push the conversation toward confiscation. This is the kind of disingenuous double-speak in which Obama routinely traffics. In the wake of the Newtown shooting, the mention of which caused Obama to tear up today, he demanded a renewal of the so-called “assault weapons” ban, provoking a furious reaction before retreating to a background-check proposal instead. The well had already been poisoned, however, and the effort failed. He’s made repeated references (Dan McLaughlin counts four times) to confiscatory policies elsewhere as a model for modern nations, and then expresses surprise and indignation when people dare to assume he means it. If you like your Glock, you can … eh, you get the point. Today’s tearful, yelling tantrum in front of the cameras proves a point I had written earlier in my column for The Week today. This showy exercise of executive action and the wide disparity between its build-up and delivery showcases Obama’s weakness and petulance, not his authority and credibility: At the heart of the problem is Obama’s refusal to acknowledge the verdict of voters in two midterm landslide losses. When Obama took office seven years ago, his Democratic Party controlled both chambers of Congress and a fair number of state legislatures. Obama now has a Congress controlled by the GOP and a record number of state legislatures in Republican control. The country, while giving Obama a second term, made it clear that they want the GOP to curb his agenda. When Bill Clinton found himself in a similar position, he famously “triangulated” on key issues to pre-empt Republican efforts. He found ways to work with his opposition on issues that mattered to both — welfare reform comes immediately to mind — and effectively outboxed them on budgetary issues while still getting important agenda items accomplished through the normal political process. Obama, on the other hand, has become even more determined to take his political ball and stomp off to the White House alone. That necessarily limits his range of action, while giving Obama an excuse for failure. “It is my strong belief that for us to get our complete arms around the problem Congress needs to act,” Obama insisted on Monday. But that goal requires a president who understands how to work with Congress. Pushing rhetoric about Australia’s solution and then demanding that Republicans budge on gun regulation is a symptom of weakness and failure, not power and accomplishment. If Obama wants to build a lasting and positive impact in his final year in office, he’ll need to climb down from his high horse and work with the Congress that people elected in 2014. Legacies are built on legislation, which gives permanence and legitimacy. Temper tantrums have almost no impact at all in the long run. That will become even more obvious in 2017 if a Republican succeeds Obama as president. As easily as Obama changed regulatory definitions and processes, a GOP president can erase his work and eliminate Obama’s legacy — and almost certainly will do so. In this sense, today was classic Barack Obama. And that’s no compliment. Update: Video added. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

America is a lot of things; racist isn’t one of them.”  -- Greg Jones 3) “The harsh reality awaiting these low-income Americans is undeniable: according to 2013 data from a 2014 Merritt Hawkins study, 55% of doctors already refuse new Medicaid patients. According to the HSC Health Tracking Physician Survey, 2008, the percentage of doctors that refuse new Medicaid patients dwarf by about 8 to 10 times the percentage that refuses new private insurance patients. Such ‘insurance’ from Obamacare not only fails to provide access to doctors, but research in the top medical journals such as Cancer, American Journal of Cardiology, Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation and Annals of Surgery, show that Medicaid beneficiaries suffer worse outcomes than similar patients with private insurance ... all at an added cost of another $800 billion by CBO estimates to taxpayers after the decade. It is not hyperbole to call Medicaid a disgrace at its annual cost of about $450 billion, and expanding it rather than helping poor people buy private insurance is simply inexplicable.” -- Scott Atlas 4) “In other words, all of the disruption, spending, taxation, and premium hikes in Obamacare has only reduced the percentage of U.S. residents without health insurance by 2.7 percentage points, from 13.9% to 11.1%: a remarkably small reduction, and far lower than what the law was supposed to achieve.” -- Avik Roy 5) “Bernie Sanders thinks you can pay for an 18 trillion dollar expansion of the welfare state — to make it align with a Denmark that doesn’t actually exist — simply by taxing ‘the billionaire class.’ There are 536 billionaires in America. Even if you confiscated everything they had — which, by the way, would surely destroy the American economy by triggering the greatest round of capital flight in human history and amount to government seizure of countless businesses — it wouldn’t come close to covering the tab of Sanders’s proposals.” -- Jonah Goldberg 6) “In 2010, 38,329 people died from drug overdoses, twice the number a decade earlier. More people died of drug overdoses than from automobile accidents (30,196), murders (13,000) or gun accidents (700).” -- Ann Coulter 7) “Between 1979 and 2010, for instance, the average after-tax income for the poorest quintile of American households rose from $14,800 to $19,200; for the second-poorest quintile, it rose from $29,900 to $39,100. Meanwhile, per-person antipoverty spending at the state and federal level increased sixfold between 1968 and 2008 — and that’s excluding Medicare, unemployment benefits and Social Security.” -- Ross Douthat 8) “Just last month, the Senate Judiciary Committee received a report that in just four years, 121 illegal aliens who had been released by ICE went on to murder Americans.” -- Mark Krikorian 9) “Officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the food-stamp program has become the country’s fastest-growing means-tested social-welfare program. Only Medicaid is more expensive. Between 2000 and 2013, SNAP caseloads grew to 47.6 million from 17.2 million, and spending grew to $80 billion from $20.6 billion, according to the Agriculture Department. SNAP participation fell slightly last year, to 46.5 million individuals, as the economy improved, but that still leaves a population the size of Spain’s living in the U.S. on food stamps.” -- Jason Riley 10) “Pace Mr. Obama, the state-prison population (which accounts for 87% of the nation’s prisoners) is dominated by violent criminals and serial thieves. In 2013 drug offenders made up less than 16% of the state-prison population; violent felons were 54% and property offenders 19%. Reducing drug-related admissions to 15 large state penitentiaries by half would lower those states’ prison count by only 7%, according to the Urban Institute. In federal prisons—which hold only 13% of the nation’s prisoners—drug offenders make up half of the inmate population. But these offenders aren’t casual drug users; overwhelmingly, they are serious traffickers. Fewer than 1% of drug offenders sentenced in federal court in 2014 were convicted of simple drug possession, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Most of those possession convictions were plea-bargained down from trafficking charges.” -- Heather Mac Donald 11) “The conservative Heritage Foundation estimated unlawful immigrant households paid $39.2 billion in 2010, but received $93.7 billion in government services.” -- Oliver Darcy 12) “On Wednesday, a Washington Post article announced that ‘The San Bernardino shooting is the second mass shooting today and the 355th this year.’ Vox, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, this newspaper and others reported similar statistics. Grim details from the church in Charleston, a college classroom in Oregon and a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado are still fresh, but you could be forgiven for wondering how you missed more than 300 other such attacks in 2015. At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth, open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four ‘mass shootings’ this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.” -- Mark Follman 13) “As Pew Research cheerfully reports, previous immigrants were ‘almost entirely’ European. But since Kennedy's immigration act, a majority of immigrants have been from Latin America. One-quarter are from Asia. Only 12 percent of post-1965-act immigrants have been from Europe -- and they're probably Muslims. Apparently, the ‘American experiment’ is actually some kind of sociological trial in which we see if people who have no history of Western government can run a constitutional republic. As of 1970, there were only 9 million Hispanics in the entire country, according to the Pew Research Center. Today, there are well more than 60 million.” -- Ann Coulter 14) “No fewer than eight major studies from around the world have found homosexuality is not a genetic condition. Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council says that these numerous, rigorous studies of identical twins have now made it impossible to argue that there is a ‘gay gene.’ If homosexuality were inborn and predetermined, then when one identical twin is homosexual, the other should be, as well. Yet one study from Yale and Columbia Universities found homosexuality common to only 6.7 percent of male identical twins and 5.3 percent of female identical twins. The low rate of common homosexuality in identical twins – around six percent – is easily explained by nurture, not nature. Researchers Peter Bearman and Hannah Brueckner concluded that environment was the determining factor. They rejected outright that ‘genetic influence independent of social context’ as the reason for homosexuality. ‘(O)ur results support the hypothesis that less gendered socialization in early childhood and preadolescence shapes subsequent same-sex romantic preferences.’ ‘Less gendered socialization’ means, a boy was without a positive father figure, or a girl was without a positive mother figure. In light of the evidence, Sprigg said simply, ‘No one is born gay.’” -- Mark Hodges 15) “Over the last year, only 1.3 million Americans of working age have entered the workforce, even as the population of this same demographic increased by more than 2.8 million. Just over 1 million members of this group found jobs. That's right -- of the new additions to the working age population, less than four in 10 found jobs. The newspapers touted the reduction in the unemployment rate to 5.3 percent as a cause for celebration. Yet for every three Americans added to the working age population (16 and older), only around one new job (1.07) has been created under Obama. At this pace, America will soon officially have a zero unemployment rate. But that will only be because no one will be looking for work.” -- Stephen Moore   If the Trump WH Ever Gave an Answer Like This, The Press Would Have Had a Total Meltdown Americans are Worried About the Direction of the Country, Poll Finds Townhall.com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

264,http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437775/our-leaders-have-opted-sympathy-instead-action,"Follow Us National Review We’re Paying the Price for Refusing Controlled Burns This Day in Liberal Judicial Activism—July 26 Dobbs Can Help Us See the Cruelty That Is Abortion The Expanding Frontier of Tyranny Ilhan Omar and the Islamophobia Industry As the families of slain police officers in Dallas, Texas, prepared for the burials of their loved ones, America’s top politicians from both sides of the aisle came to a consensus. They decided that the solution to racial tensions — tensions that have now resulted in the mass shooting of white police officers, as well as a dramatically escalating murder rate in America’s largest cities — was to talk about feelings. Yes, feelings. Not a culture of crime in minority areas of America’s major cities. Not the hamstringing of police by the Department of Justice, or the nasty, politically driven coverage of yet-to-be-investigated police shootings by the media. No, said our politicians. We had to discuss coming together in a sort of national group-therapy session. Naturally, America’s group-therapy leader, President Obama, led the way. After two videos surrounding police shootings went viral — one showing the shooting of Alton Sterling in Louisiana, the second, the aftermath of the shooting of Philando Castile in Minnesota — Obama leapt to the airwaves to declare, without evidence, that such shootings were not merely “isolated incidents.” No, Obama explained — they were more. “They are symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal-justice system, the racial disparities that appear across the system year after year, and the resulting lack of trust that exists between law enforcement and too many of the communities they serve,” Obama stated, ignoring the fact that such statistical disparities are largely due to higher rates of crime among some racial subgroups. RELATED: More Hypocrisy from Black Lives Matter Obama concluded, holding the conch: “All Americans should recognize the anger, frustration, and grief that so many Americans are feeling — feelings that are being expressed in peaceful protests and vigils. Michelle and I share those feelings. Rather than fall into a predictable pattern of division and political posturing, let’s reflect on what we can do better.” Except that Obama offered no solutions. Because advocates of feelings over facts never do. They believe that merely acknowledging feelings, justifying them, and excusing them allows them to wash their hands of the problem entirely. It’s not just Obama. On the right side of the aisle, Newt Gingrich declared, “If you are a normal, white American, the truth is you don’t understand being black in America and you instinctively underestimate the level of discrimination and the level of additional risk.” Senator Marco Rubio stated: “Those of us who are not African American will never fully understand the experience of being black in America. . . . How they feel is a reality that we cannot and should not ignore.” RELATED: Black Lives Matter: Radicals Using Moderates to Help Tear America Apart  But if the political goal is to alleviate feelings of discrimination, no end point can ever be reached so long as a disproportionate number of black people end up in prison. And a disproportionate number of black people end up in prison not because of discrimination in the criminal-justice system, but because a disproportionate number of black people commit crimes. Obama, Gingrich, and Rubio all prize offering sympathy over help; crediting the unjustified feeling that there is pervasive bias in the criminal-justice system means making evidence secondary to perceptions. In the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Mo., a large majority of black Americans felt that Officer Darren Wilson was guilty of murder in August 2015. They were wrong. But according to our political leaders, such feelings ought to be granted the patina of legitimacy. This isn’t leadership. It’s moral cowardice. #share#There are only two real solutions to ending tension between black communities and the police. First, the police could withdraw from black communities entirely. That would end the problem of confrontations, but it would also result in a tremendous uptick in crime. That’s beginning to happen now, as Heather Mac Donald has documented in what she calls the “Ferguson effect”: Violent crime, up to and including murder, is skyrocketing in America’s major cities, and especially in minority areas. Second, the police could actually solve the crime problem. That would require more police presence, not less. RELATED: The Demagogues’ War on Cops In the short term, more police presence could exacerbate conflict with members of minority communities, of course. That’s because policing in high-crime areas is necessarily more abrasive and aggressive — if you place men and women in blue at higher risk of danger, then they’re significantly more likely to get rough with those they confront. But it is also possible that more police deployed to high-crime areas would tamp down racial confrontations. As Jill Loevy, of the Los Angeles Times — a liberal herself — writes, “It may seem paradoxical, but the police tactics that protesters have recently denounced as harassment and discrimination actually overcompensate for what is, in essence, a weak police presence in these neighborhoods.” RELATED: Fundamentally Transformed In the long term, there is no choice but to increase police presence. In order for high-crime areas to become places of investment and safety — in order to tamp down the need for more policing — the source of crime must be removed: criminals. And there is only one group in America empowered with the ability to remove criminals from high-crime communities, no matter how much locals may feel uncomfortable about it: the cops. #related#Over the course of American history, population groups in which crime is concentrated have routinely come into conflict with the police — and, as their crime rate has lowered, so have their adversarial relations with law enforcement. Lowering the crime rate in particular areas has generally occurred through those areas’ advancing economically, or through population movement. But America’s current high-crime areas are short on economic opportunity and mobility thanks to intergenerational legacies of single motherhood and crime. That leaves just one option: cleaning up the streets as they currently stand.  But that’s precisely the option foreclosed by the Black Lives Matter evidence-last, feelings-first racialism we’re now hearing from our loudest and most prominent voices. And that, in turn, means more black Americans will die. More cops will die, too, as they’re forced to try to handle crime while understaffed and overburdened. And the drumbeat of criticism will continue, because it’s always easier for politicians to tell you they feel your pain than to give you solutions that may hurt.

By JEREMY HERB 01/22/2016 05:17 AM EST Updated 01/22/2016 01:00 PM EST Donald Trump speaks during the Republican Society Patriot Dinner at the Citadel Military College in February. | Getty The Republican defense establishment is terrified Donald Trump will fail the “commander in chief test” with voters should he continue to defy all predictions and become the GOP nominee. Just a few months ago, at an annual gathering of national security leaders at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California, former Republican lawmakers and national security officials openly dismissed the real estate mogul-turned-entertainer, predicting his campaign for the White House would soon falter. But with Trump's steady rise in the polls, even as national security has loomed ever larger in the campaign, they are now officially spooked by his apparent lack of preparedness to be commander-in-chief — and what it could mean in a head-to-head contest against the Democratic favorite, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to interviews with more than a dozen Republican lawmakers and national security experts. Trump has made a long list of curious statements on foreign policy. In a recent debate, he didn't seem to know about the ""nuclear triad"" — the nuclear-armed bombers, land-based missiles and submarines that make up the U.S. atomic arsenal. He has confused the F-35 fighter jet with the Long-Range Strike Bomber, and the Kurds with Iran's Quds Force. He's said he gets military advice watching television, has praised U.S. foes like Russian President Vladimir Putin and has shown no apparent interest in seeking the counsel of the party’s national security sages. ""He wouldn’t just get an F — he’d get a zero,” said Richard Fontaine, president of the Center for a New American Security, who is backing Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and is a former top aide to Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee who now chairs the Armed Services Committee. A who’s who of GOP defense bigwigs have disparaged Trump’s national security missives. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden said in October that he was “troubled by a whole series of his statements.” Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote an op-ed, “The kind of president we need,” which said: “Primal screaming may be good therapy, but it is a poor substitute for practical politics.” By ELIZA COLLINS And McCain, whom Trump mocked last year for having been a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has repeatedly slammed Trump’s claim that he’ll convince Mexico to pay for a wall along the U.S. southern border. “If he’s the nominee, he’ll have a pretty steep learning curve. I think that’s pretty obvious,” McCain told POLITICO. Trump has argued that he is the best candidate in the Republican field for the military, and that his business background would help root out waste at the Pentagon. During a national security speech he delivered in September on the retired battleship USS Iowa, he vowed that he would build up the military “so big and so strong and so great, and it will be so powerful that I don’t think we’re ever going to have to use it.” But in the view of the GOP defense establishment, Trump has emerged as a key threat to the party's strategy to make national security and foreign policy a cornerstone of the race for the White House, as well as the case against Clinton. Indeed, at the Reagan Forum, the assembled experts dismissed both Trump and rival candidate Ben Carson as little more than a bad joke in panel after panel, offering the mantra that both anti-establishment campaigns would falter once voters started paying attention to national security. Then came November’s deadly terrorist attacks in Paris and December’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., which placed terrorism high on the list of voter concerns. But while Carson stumbled, as predicted, Trump has only grown stronger with Republican primary voters. “Obviously, nobody really took Trump seriously for quite time. Now, of course, he can’t be ignored,” said Dov Zakheim, who was a senior foreign policy adviser to former President George W. Bush and served as the Pentagon’s budget chief in the Bush administration. He is not backing any candidate in the 2016 race. Also galling to longtime GOP defense leaders: Unlike the other candidates, Trump does not appear to have reached out to any of the traditional advisers on foreign policy and national security. Analysts at the major conservative think tanks and others who have briefed 2016 candidates say they’ve heard nothing from Trump’s campaign — and know no one advising him. “Absolutely none that I am aware of,” said Eric Edelman, an adviser to 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney who co-founded the John Hay Initiative, which has briefed multiple candidates and offered a foreign policy playbook to all of the 2016 field. By ELIZA COLLINS Even outreach initiated by the defense community has gone nowhere. Mackenzie Eaglen of American Enterprise Institute said she asked for a meeting with the Trump campaign this month to talk military issues, and sent them AEI’s defense strategy. The campaign was not interested. ""I got back the most classic letter, thanking me for being a supporter and sending the strategy,” said Eaglen, who has briefed several other candidates and was advising Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Trump’s disinterest in boning up on foreign policy is hardly unique to those issues. Shunning Washington insiders has been a key element of Trump’s campaign playbook that’s riled up a conservative base angry with Republicans and Democrats alike in Washington. “The so-called insiders within the Washington ruling class are the people who got us into this trouble. So why should we continue to pay attention to them?” Trump wrote in his recent book “Crippled America.” In a general election, Republicans worry that Clinton's long record on foreign policy as secretary of state will provide a clear contrast to Trump — akin to Clinton's ""3 a.m. phone call"" ad in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary — and allow Clinton to avoid a long list of vulnerabilities in her foreign policy record. At the same time, they hold out at least some hope that Trump's skills as a counter-puncher could still prove formidable if he's the nominee. ""He’s got a real knack and an instinct for sussing out people’s vulnerabilities and going after them very, very effectively,"" said Edelman, who added he's not supporting Trump or any other specific GOP candidate. Trump has claimed some military advisers — sort of. In the same interview in which Trump said, “I watch the shows,” when asked where he gets his military advice, he ticked off the names of former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and retired Col. Jack Jacobs, an NBC News military analyst. A spokesman for Bolton said the two spoke during the 2014 election cycle when Trump donated to Bolton's political action committee, but not since. And Jacobs told Mother Jones that he has not consulted on national security issues with Trump. Trump vowed in September that he would soon unveil his national security team, and he made the pledge again in an October interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “I do have a great group of people, and at the right time, I’m going to roll them out,” Trump told Hewitt. That rollout has not happened. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump greets supporters during a campaign rally aboard the USS Iowa on September 15, 2015. | Getty On the campaign trail, Trump talks tough on foreign policy, just like much of the Republican field. In his speeches, he frequently invokes famous U.S. Gens. George Patton and Douglas MacArthur to contrast with President Barack Obama's military team. He’s vowed to pummel the Islamic State and take their oil — “I would bomb the s--- out of them,” he said at a November Iowa rally — while playing up his opposition to the initial Iraq invasion in 2003. But to the party’s security and defense experts, Trump’s knowledge gap on military issues in interviews and debates has been cringe-worthy. He was stumped by a question at December’s CNN debate — also from Hewitt — on what he would do about the “nuclear triad,” appearing not to understand the question. “I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me,” he said. Hewitt has been the source of multiple Trump foreign policy blunders. On his radio show, he asked Trump about the Quds Force in one interview, but the candidate thought he was referring to the Kurds. (Trump says he misheard Hewitt’s “gotcha question.”) Another time, Hewitt asked Trump about the next-generation bomber, only to get a response from Trump about pilots criticizing the F-35 fighter. The 2016 campaigns are bashing Trump’s foreign policy statements as they try to chip into his lead. Bush’s largest super PAC released an ad in December bashing Trump for saying he gets his military advice by watching “the shows.” “It is certainly relevant to voters,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said in an interview with Hewitt this month. ""Does a potential commander in chief know what the nuclear triad is, much less is he or she prepared and able to strengthen it and keep this country safe?” Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Republican defense pundits have also become more vocal. A slew of opinion articles have taken on Trump, such as former McCain speechwriter Mark Salter's ""We Deserve Better Than Donald Trump"" and John Bellinger's “Donald Trump is a danger to our national security.” Bellinger, a legal adviser to George W. Bush’s National Security Council and State Department, argued that Trump’s call to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. isn't just harmful to Republicans in the campaign, but is already damaging U.S. interests abroad and making the country less safe. “It is amazing to me that Donald Trump seems to be utterly disinterested in the details of difficult defense or national security or foreign policy issues,” said Bellinger, who is backing Jeb Bush. Trump has said he'll be prepared on foreign policy when he takes office, but unsurprisingly, the GOP defense community isn’t buying it. “I don’t think it’s so terrible that Trump doesn’t know a lot about foreign policy and national security,” said Elliott Abrams of the Council on Foreign Relations, a former aide in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations who has briefed a half-dozen GOP hopefuls. “What’s troubling is that he doesn’t know that he doesn’t know anything about national security. He thinks he knows a lot about national security, so he is spending zero time learning. That’s the worrying thing.” CORRECTION: Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated John Bellinger’s first name and that he was an adviser to George W. Bush’s presidential campaign. Missing out on the latest scoops?

06:28 You can read our latest article on Obama’s gun control town hall – and the NRA response – here: 2.21am GMT
02:21 The difference in style could not have been more stark. At Trump’s rally in Bernie Sanders’ hometown of Burlington, Vermont, protesters were thrown out en masse - and people who did not swear allegiance to Trump were not allowed in. A bombastic Trump said that gun free zones in schools were “bait” for “sickos.” Outside, a large crowd of protesters gathered, chanting Bernie Sanders’ name. At the same time, president Obama held a townhall meeting on CNN to discuss gun violence with a range of audience questions from people across the spectrum, from a rape victim who wanted to be reassured that she would still be able to protect herself, to a sheriff who wanted to know if he would be able to enforce the law, to Mark Kelly, the husband of Gabrielle Giffords, the representative who was shot in Arizona in a mass shooting attack. The president’s cool demeanor frayed only once; when challenged over his use of the term “conspiracy” over whether his government wanted to take people’s guns from them en masse. “Yes! I think it’s fair to call it a conspiracy [theory]!” he said. Earlier in the day he wrote an op-ed in the New York Times pledging not to support or campaign for any candidate who did not support gun control legislation. 2.13am GMT
02:13 “Some of the proposals I’m making mightnot be as effective as others,” he says. “But let’s not assume every few weeks there’s a mass shooting; every few months there’s one that gets national publicity; every day people get shot on the streets and nobody hears about it.” “We can do better, if we come together,” he ends. 2.09am GMT
02:09 Tre Bosley, whose brother Terrell was shot and killed 10 years ago, says he’s lost “countless friends and family members” to gun violence. “Most of us aren’t thinking of our life on a long term scale. Most of us are thinking minute-to-minute.” He asks what advice the president has for him. “You know - when I see you, I think about my own youth,” Obama says. “I probably wasn’t that different from you. But I lived in a more forgiving environment. If I screwed up, there wasn’t much risk of being shot.” He pauses. “And - that’s how all kids should grow up. Wherever they live.” 2.05am GMT
02:05 Cooper asks about Obama’s New York Times pledge not to support any candidate who does not support gun control reform. “The majority of people in this country are a lot more sensible than those in Washington,” he says. “And the reason Washington doesn’t work well, is the loudest, shrillest voices, the least compromising, the most powerful, or those with the most money have the most influence.” The way Washington changes is when people vote. The way we break the deadlock on this issue is when ... the NRA doesn’t have a stranglehold on congress. 2.02am GMT
02:02 Mark Kelly, the astronaut husband of rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in a mass shooting event in Arizona, asks “with 350m guns, if the federal govt wanted to confiscate those objects, how would they do that.” “First of all, every time I see Gabby, I’m thrilled, because I visited her in the hospital,” Obama says. “As we left the hospital to go to a memorial service, we had word that she opened her eyes for the first time.” Giffords is here too. Obama says mistrust of the federal government “is in our DNA.” He calls it a conspiracy - which Cooper disputes. For the first time, Obama seems visibly angry. “Yes! I think it’s fair to call it a conspiracy [theory]!” “It’s a false notion circulated with political intent, which prevents us coming together to make us safer. The notion that we can’t agree on some things while not agreeing on others, and the notion is, well, the president secretly wants to do x - would mean that we’d be paralysed on everything.” 1.57am GMT

01:51 “There are conspiracy theories floating around the internet all the time,” Obama says. He points to Jade Helm, the training exercise in Texas. “People were convinced it was the start of martial law.” Then, he starts talking about smart gun technologies - weapons that only work if the wearer of a certain bracelet has their hand on the trigger. He says manufacturers backed off their development after pressure from the NRA. “That doesn’t make sense to me. I would think people would want the choice,” he says. “It has not been developed primarily because it has been blocked by the NRA. So what we proposed was, we’ll do some of the research, and then give everybody a choice, because I think there will in fact be a market for that.” 1.45am GMT
01:45 CNN just replayed this footage of Obama’s tearful moment recalling the Newtown massacre a couple of days ago. Speaking to Cooper, Obama says that when he visited Newtown two days after the attack, that was the only time he’d ever seen Secret Service members cry on duty. “As I enter into my last year as president, I could not be prouder of the work that we’ve done, but it also makes me really humble. A lot of the work you do is just to incrementally make things better,” he says, speaking with unusual candor. Whenever he talks about the “mischaracterisation” of his views on the subject, his frustration is palpable. 1.40am GMT
01:40 Trump, too, is addressing the question of guns. And he’s come to very different conclusions to the president. “We need our guns,” @realDonaldTrump says, talking about guns extensively as his rally hits the hour mark. #GunsInAmerica The contrasting delivery style between the two men is stark. “You know what a gun free zone is to a sicko?” Trump just said, according to Ben on the scene. “That’s bait!” He pledges to get rid of them in schools on his first day in office. As Donald Trump calls for more of the good guys to be armed, a guy in the Secret-Service-screened crowd shouts: ""Not tonight!"" 1.37am GMT
01:37 Back to Obama, who’s talking about the Newtown massacre. “Everybody here is in favour of going after criminals ... creating an environment where kids don’t turn into criminals,” Obama says. “What we have to [also] do is make sure it’s not so easy for them to get access to deadly weapons.” 1.30am GMT
01:30 Meanwhile, in Burlington, the scene at Trump’s rally appears to be worsening, with more and more protesters - and those suspected of being protesters - being thrown out into the Vermont cold Trump is urging security to confiscate protesters' coats. Trump: ""Confiscate his coat. It’s about 10 degrees below zero outside. Keep his coat. Tell him we’ll send it to him in a couple of weeks."" And now another round of protesters shouting ""Trump is a racist."" On stage, Trump complains security is taking too long I can't keep track of the number of protesters in the rally right now as they get removed and removed ""We'll get more and more angry as we go along,"" Trump warns for protesters as more are escorted out.

01:25 “Do you think a good guy with a gun can be a bulwark against a bad guy with a gun,” Cooper asks. Throws the question to Kimberly Corban, a rape survivor, who says that being able to buy a firearm is “a basic responsibility as a parent at this point.” “First of all, obviously, your story is horrific,” Obama says. He praises her strength in telling it. “I just want to repeat that there’s nothing we’ve proposed that would make it harder for you to get a firearm.” “There really is nothing we’re proposing that makes it harder for you to purchase a firearm if you need one.” “There are always questions about whether or not having a firearm in the home protects you from that kind of violence,” he adds. “I’m not sure we’re going to be able to resolve it.” 1.20am GMT
01:20 The first question for President Obama comes from Taya Kyle, the widow of Chris Kyle, on whom the book American Sniper was based. She worries that the laws will not be followed by the murderers. “Would it be a better use of our time to give people hope in a different way?” She says that America is at an all-time low for murder rate. Obama says that the low violent crime rate “is not something that we celebrate enough ... most cities are much safer than they were.” He disputes the idea that the reason for that is high gun ownership, saying that the places with higher gun ownership are often places where the violent crime rate hasn’t dropped as much. But, he tells Taya, “you will still be able to buy a firearm.” 1.16am GMT
01:16 “We’re trying to do something modest, and the response is that we’re trying to take away everybody’s guns,” Obama says. He says his position has been “mischaracterised.” He laments the NRA’s lack of attendance. “We have invited them repeatedly, but if you listen to the rhetoric, it is so over the top - and not acknowledging the fact that there is no other consumer item we purchase ... theres nothing else in our lives that we purchase that we don’t try to make it a little safer if we can.” He points to the fact that traffic fatalities have reduced drastically in his lifetime. “The notion that we would not apply the same basic principles to gun ownership ... or the notion that everything we do is somehow a plot to take away guns, that contradicts what we do to try to create a better life for Americans in any other area of life.” He says he’s happy to meet with the NRA, but “the conversation has to be based on truth.” 1.12am GMT
01:12 Now the president is talking about his executive action on Tuesday to shrink the private sale loophole. “We want to put everybody on notice that the def of doing bus - which means you have to run a background check - is if you are making a profit and selling multiple guns.” Cooper points out that this is, perhaps, not specific enough. “Ultimately, it’s up to Congress to set up a system that is efficient,” Obama says. “The fact that the system may not catch every single person,” he says, is outweighed by the fact that it could save lives. 1.08am GMT
01:08 Back to Obama. “I respect the Second Amendment, I respect the right to bear arms. I respect sportsmanship,” he says. “...but when you’re losing 30,000 people to firearms, two thirds of them suicides...” He says he wants to combine gun safety with sensible background checks. “If we can take that 30,000 to, say, 28,000, that’s two thousand families who don’t have to go through what the families of Newtown had to go through,” he says. 1.06am GMT
01:06 In Burlington, a brief interruption to Trump’s speech: Protesters come through wearing signs that say ""dump Trump"" and shouting it. They get escorted out. Trump supporters are now deciding that random attendees are hecklers and should be kicked out and security is following suit A few people just kicked out but unclear why. I didn't hear them cheer against Trump. Girl was upset to leave saying ""I didnt do anything."" And then security kicks them out when they insist they have done nothing wrong https://t.co/h5AJbBpD8h",2016-01-07 21:21:32,Protests at Trump rally and Obama speaks out on guns – as it happened,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
269,https://www.ocregister.com/2016/01/18/inside-the-snitch-tank-read-the-full-story-of-murder-misconduct-and-justice-delayed/,"Trending: About this story: This report was written by Edward Humes, the author of 13 nonfiction books and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his Orange County Register coverage of the military. The story is based on extensive reporting by the Register’s staff, including Tony Saavedra, David Ferrell, Kelly Puente, Tom Berg, Ian Wheeler and Roxana Kopetman, previously published stories and legal documents obtained by the newspaper since the arrest of Scott Dekraai after the worst mass shooting in Orange County history. Illustrations were drawn by Jeff Goertzen. Read more at the Register’s ‘Inside the Snitch Tank’ site On his last day of freedom, Scott Dekraai spoke on the phone with his ex-wife. Let’s meet for coffee, he suggested. Michelle Fournier was shocked. A day earlier they had squared off at yet another court hearing in their acrimonious battle over custody of their 8-year-old son. Things had not gone Dekraai’s way at the hearing, and the argument had continued on the phone, until Dekraai brought his ex-wife up short with his suggestion that they meet in person. No way, Fournier responded. She did not want to see him. Definitely not. This would prove to be a fateful decision. If he couldn’t have a one-on-one, Dekraai decided after hanging up on Fournier, he’d just have to confront his ex-wife at her workplace instead – one last time. Then he walked out to his garage to survey his well-oiled collection of five pistols, four rifles and a 12-gauge shotgun. The violence that followed just a few hours later would make national headlines. It would alter the course of lives and families for years to come. It would drag a peaceful, tight-knit community into an exclusive club no one wishes to join: the fraternity of towns marred by mass murder. And, finally, the official response to Dekraai’s rampage would expose and shame Orange County authorities who in their zeal to ensure a win in court had stopped playing by the rules that ensure justice for all. Scott Dekraai, without ever knowing it, had exposed the snitch tank.  “No town could have been less prepared for Scott Dekraai.” Scott Dekraai was, by most accounts, an angry man. He had displayed his rage many times over the years to those closest to him. There was the stepfather he beat up over rent. There was his ex-wife, who told a friend that he put a gun to her head shortly after their wedding. And there was the ex-employer he had raged at and sued (unsuccessfully) for firing him for drug use on the job. Neighbors and co-workers who knew him casually over the years thought him a great guy – even those who crewed with him aboard the close confines of ships and his neighbors in Huntington Beach at the time of the shootings. But those who knew him best agree that his life and behavior, already troubled, went drastically downhill in 2007 after a boat accident severely injured his legs. Despite multiple surgeries, the 41-year-old tugboat crewman had been left disabled, in constant pain, diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome, and possessed of a hair-trigger temper. He was never the same after that accident, more than one friend lamented. Sometimes Dekraai wished aloud that his most badly mangled leg had been amputated instead of salvaged. At least then the pain and the rage finally might have eased. The latest custody dispute with his ex proved to be the final straw, Dekraai would later say. Late on the morning of Oct. 12, 2011, he walked out of his neat, single-story house in Huntington Beach. He walked by the lawn he kept freshly trimmed and the gray house paint kept perfect, with a decorative anchor set smartly in the garden and his American flag snapping in the breeze above a concrete driveway. As he climbed into his white pickup truck and headed north to the next city up the coast, there was just one jarring element in this fastidious portrait of suburban life: Dekraai left the house in a bulletproof vest. • • • The center of life in Seal Beach is Old Town, with its old-fashioned Main Street – where local businesses rule, the curbside parking is unmetered, and the fanciest restaurant’s only dress requirement is shirt and shoes. This is Orange County’s (and Southern California’s) least known, least fashionable, throwback beach town, set against the concrete-lined San Gabriel River that divides Orange County from Los Angeles County. Seal Beach lacks the surf-town hustle of Huntington Beach, the high-end glitz of Newport Beach, the Riviera splendor of Laguna Beach. At the foot of Main Street stands the gray timbers of the Seal Beach Pier, and the stretch of sand on either side of it is so broad, flat and empty that, on weekdays at least, it’s possible to walk the strand and feel lonely. It was not always this way. Seal Beach started where its sister beach towns to the south have ended up, glamorous and tourist-laden. Seal Beach was the first of the beach towns to be served by the Red Car Line, bringing in the ocean-bound hordes beginning in 1904. The city fathers enticed them by building what was then the longest pleasure pier on the West Coast, with 52 giant “scintillators” left over from the most recent world’s fair erected at the end. These huge light standards, arrayed like a battalion of soldiers staring out to sea, cast brilliant rainbows of light onto the water for night swimming. By 1920, the Jewel Café and the Seal Beach Dance Pavilion and Bathhouse with its 90-foot plunge flanked the pier and were the talk of the coast. Seal Beach was a must-stop for weekend beachgoers with a quarter to burn on the trolley, as well as for the stars of the silent screen arriving in their roadsters and limos. Cecil B. DeMille parted the waters in his first filming of the “Ten Commandments” here, as sightseers plied the beach walk on miniature wicker cars powered by electric motors. A giant roller coaster two blocks long towered over all, and celebrities popped into town aboard their private planes, which landed at the Seal Beach Airport, famous for its Airport Club 24-hour casino. Prohibition and the Great Depression, followed by the demise of the Red Cars, ended all that, grinding Seal Beach’s incarnation as Sin City into dust. In its place arose a quiet family town known for its hokey, beloved Main Street Christmas parade, and for being one of the safest places to live in Orange County. Name a crime, and it occurs less often here than any other town in the area, and at a rate far below the national average. From 2005 to October 2011, there was exactly one murder in Seal Beach: an 88-year-old man shot his 86-year-old wife as she lay in a nursing home suffering from advanced dementia. The family begged the community for understanding in the wake of this “mercy killing.” No town could have been less prepared for Scott Dekraai as he turned off Pacific Coast Highway a block away from Main Street and pulled into the busy Bay City Center shopping plaza. He drove past the center’s collection of shops, restaurants and offices painted in a beachy color scheme of cream and sea-green. Then he parked near a two-story building topped with a distinctive cupola, its second floor dominated by a dermatology clinic and its first floor split between a steak restaurant and a small business called Salon Meritage. Dekraai sat a moment and stared at the hair salon where his ex-wife worked, then stepped out of his truck in his body armor and walked to the door, armed to the teeth.  “You shouldn’t be meeting that guy anywhere.” Earlier that day, Michelle Fournier packed a lunch for her son, Dominic, then drove the second-grader from her Garden Grove home to McGaugh Elementary School in Seal Beach. She had two adult children from a first marriage but Dominic was her baby, and the bubbly 48-year-old doted on the boy whose custody and time she reluctantly shared with her ex-husband Dekraai. She particularly loved to cut Dominic’s hair herself, but the custody disputes had become so bitter and petty that Dekraai would take the boy to someone else for a haircut just to spite her. On Oct. 12, as the 7:55 a.m. bell sounded, Dominic marched off to class, his black school bag slung over his shoulder. Fournier watched him go, then left to get ready for work at nearby Salon Meritage. Mother and son would never see each other again. Not long afterward, Salon Meritage began coming to life for the day. Stylist Jeffery Segall arrived to help open up, followed by his friend and colleague Victoria Buzzo, who burst in wearing one of her signature splashy outfits. This time it was black shorts and a white blouse, with her hair tied up in a twist. “Are you going to tap dance for us?” Segall joked. Buzzo cracked up. Another stylist, Gordon Gallego, arrived to have his own hair cut by Buzzo before his first customer walked in. Just as doctors make difficult patients, hair stylists can have a hard time sitting in the chair passively, and Gallego and Buzzo always turned their session into a good-natured battle royale. She loved doing his hair “her way,” Gallego would remember at Buzzo’s memorial service. “It was always an event,” Segall added. Gradually Salon Meritage settled into its Wednesday morning routine. Paul Wilson, husband of Meritage manicurist Christy Lynne Wilson, came by for a 10:30 a.m. haircut with Gallego. Meritage owner Randy Fannin and his wife, Sandy, brought in some supplies for the shop. The salon’s regular customers began strolling in for their appointments. Hattie Stretz of Los Alamitos, a lively presence at age 73, arrived to have her nails done by her daughter, newlywed Laura Webb Elody. Stretz was popular with the other stylists and often brought homemade pies to the shop. Fournier came in next, offering her co-workers half a lemon cake with cheese cream frosting, a leftover from a treat she had baked for her adult son, Chad. Fournier was popular at the salon, the kind of stylist customers came back to see year in and year out. “She could gab away. She was one of those girlfriends you could never get enough of,” recalled salon client Kari Salveson. She had been coming to have Fournier do her hair for a decade and had a simple explanation for that loyalty: “She made you smile and she made you laugh.” Fournier’s friends and co-workers knew all about her troubles with her ex-husband. They had been married only three years after a whirlwind romance. They had been great as boyfriend-girlfriend, one friend observed, but terrible as husband-wife. Fournier left him in 2006, before his crippling accident in 2007. It was Dekraai who filed for divorce. Since then, he had come by the salon more than once to fight with her right in front of the staff and customers. She had complained of his “manic” desire to control every aspect and minute of Dominic’s life. The salon workers made for a close-knit group, like an extended family, and the other stylists did not care for Dekraai. Buzzo once shoved him out the door. That Wednesday, Fournier told her colleagues that her ex-husband had asked her to meet him for coffee. “Can you believe that?” she marveled. “I hope you said ‘no,’” Gallego responded. “You shouldn’t be meeting that guy anywhere.” As lunchtime approached, customers left the salon and others arrived. Seal Beach youth soccer volunteer Michele Fast had to cut short a phone call with her mother so she could make her haircut appointment at Meritage. A mother of three, Fast was well-known and well-liked in The Hill area of Seal Beach, where the 47-year-old could be seen every day on her brisk walks through the neighborhood with her Labrador. This would be her first time patronizing Salon Meritage. Hattie Stretz, meanwhile, decided to linger at the salon, extending her nail work into a hairdo. While her daughter Laura did the styling, Stretz chatted with her salon favorite, Buzzo. Those two always chattered together like old friends. Manicurist Christy Wilson then decided to take advantage of a lull to slip into Fournier’s chair for a wash and cut. Sometime around 1 p.m. Segall’s last client of the day canceled. He had planned to stay all afternoon, but now could cut loose, yet another fateful decision that day. “The weather is beautiful,” he announced. “I’m going to enjoy it.” He heard laughter as he walked out the door – the mood at Salon Meritage was frequently joyful. “See you tomorrow, buddy,” salon owner Fannin called after him, because that’s what he always said in farewell. About 15 minutes later, at 1:21 p.m., a balding, hulking, overweight man wearing a bulletproof vest walked into the salon. Scott Dekraai came armed with three powerful handguns – a 9 mm Springfield, a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum, and a Heckler & Koch .45 – and plenty of ammunition stuffed in the pockets of his cargo pants. It would be over in two minutes.  “Hold on a minute, Scott. Please don’t do this.” Scott Dekraai had stopped halfway between Huntington and Seal Beach that day, pulling over at the windswept expanse of Bolsa Chica State Beach to sit on the sand in his bulletproof vest and think about killing his ex-wife. It didn’t take him long to decide. When he burst into the salon with guns in hand, Dekraai strode, limping but fast, right up to Fournier. The rest of the people in the room – stylists holding brushes and scissors, customers swaddled with smocks in their chairs – froze in surprise. Randy Fannin broke the spell first. The devoted grandfather, active and vigorous at age 62, a man who loved his work and his staff, which loved him right back, pleaded with Dekraai. “Hold on a minute, Scott. Please don’t do this. There’s another way. Let’s go outside and talk.” Fannin’s wife of 17 years, out of sight mixing dye in the back of the salon, heard it all. Sandy Fannin heard her husband’s plea, and she heard what happened a heartbeat later: Dekraai opened fire. A seemingly endless series of loud, jolting pops followed as Sandy stayed under cover and the salon filled with screams. When a lull in the gunfire finally came, Sandy started to emerge to check on her Randy, but then the shooting resumed. Dekraai had been reloading. There were several pauses before silence fell for good. Dekraai killed Fournier first, shooting his ex-wife in the head and chest without a word. Christy Wilson died in Fournier’s chair moments later. The 47-year-old stylist and mother of three had testified against Dekraai in the custody case. He shot her two times. Her husband, Paul, who had come and gone earlier that day at the salon, would later find a letter at home from the woman he called his soulmate: “I went into work late today, so I sat outside thinking about how lucky I am, how lucky we are to have our house, our kids and each other. I love you every day, good, bad and ugly. We are each other’s worlds. We have to keep our love strong and have the lifetime together we promised each other, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer until death do us part.” As Dekraai turned from his second victim, Fannin, scissors in hand, moved toward him. Whether he was still trying to calm Dekraai or hoped to stop him with the only weapon at hand, no one can say for sure. Dekraai shot him at point-blank range. Those who knew him aren’t surprised that the salon owner tried to intervene. “He was the most peaceful man. He truly believed in the best of everybody,” recalled stylist Lorraine Bruyelle, who was supposed to have been there at the time with her kindergartner daughter. But she had been delayed when her little girl said she was hungry after school, and they had stopped for a second lunch. By the time they arrived at the salon, an officer blocked the door. “Everybody is dead in there,” she recalls him saying. After killing Fannin, Dekraai strode through the salon shooting others as he passed. He shot and killed Laura Webb Elody, then turned his gun on her mother, Hattie Stretz, as she sat in her daughter’s chair. First-time customer Michele Fast, who had been in such a rush to get there, was shot in the chest. So was Victoria Buzzo in her “tap dance” outfit. Finally Dekraai shot and killed 65-year-old Lucia Kondas of Huntington Beach, the retired administrator of the Orange County Health Care Agency’s Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services, whose funeral a few days later would be packed with mourners she had helped in life. Dekraai shot most of his victims multiple times, in the head and chest – where the damage, and the likelihood of death, would be greatest. There were as many as eight other men and women inside the salon during Scott Dekraai’s rampage. Several survived by running outside. Three people locked themselves in a facial room and remained silent, though one of them made a whispered call to 911, begging for help as her friends screamed and died. Two others hid in the bathroom. One stylist threw himself onto the floor with the dead and dying, covered his head with his hands and hoped the killer would bypass him. He did. When the shooting finally stopped and he heard the sound of someone leaving the salon, he reached for his phone to call for help, joining what by then had become a chorus of 911 calls from in and around the salon. Outside, Dekraai wasn’t through shooting yet. As he walked to his truck in the parking lot, he noticed a green Land Rover sitting nearby, a neatly dressed, tough-looking man poised behind the wheel. To Dekraai, he looked like an off-duty or undercover cop. Fearing the man might be reaching to the floorboards for a weapon, Dekraai aimed through the closed passenger window and shot the man in the face. Seal Beach resident David Caouette, a 64-year-old former Navy SEAL, may have looked the part of a police officer, but he was a car salesman who worked for a Land Rover dealership in Mission Viejo. He had just stopped at the shopping center for a bite at his favorite restaurant, Patty’s Place, next to Salon Meritage. And so Caouette, in the wrong place at the wrong time, became the eighth person to be killed that day by Scott Dekraai in the worst mass murder in Orange County history. As Dekraai continued walking to his truck, face impassive, a pistol still in hand and pointed toward the sky, four men ran over from across the street. They were contractors who had been working on an oil clean-up site nearby and, rather remarkably, when they heard the gunfire they had run toward the sound. Two were retired Marines, schooled in combat. Another was a certified emergency medical technician. The group’s leader, Doug Childers, reacted more on instinct than common sense, he’d later say. But then Dekraai spotted the advancing men and turned to face them, his gun still pointed up. “He looked right at me,” Childers would recall. “Then he pointed it at me.” The four men slowed to a walk. But they kept moving in, one of them barking Dekraai’s description into a cellphone to a police dispatcher. After a moment’s hesitation, Dekraai turned and walked away from the men and the area near the salon. “He was walking casually,” another of the contractors, Michael Sauerwein, marveled afterward. “As if he was just walking down the street.” Childers, who had worked eight years as a firefighter at the now-shuttered El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, raced to the salon door, followed by John Gallegos and EMT Brendan Peña. Sauerwein stationed himself near the door to the salon, where he could keep an eye on the gunman, watching as Dekraai climbed into a shiny white Toyota Tundra pickup truck and drove off. As the three men entered the salon, none were prepared for the scene awaiting them. Gallegos, a combat veteran with 22 years in the Marines, was shaken to the core by what he could describe only as an “ambush.” “In combat, you’re either going to get shot or shoot somebody,” he would later explain. “Here these guys had no expectation of any of that. They had plans. They had plans! They had lives to live. … They were civilians. They were supposed to go home.” • • • When the sound of shooting had ended and the salon fell silent, Sandy Fannin was the first to emerge from hiding. The salon smells of shampoo and hair dye had been replaced by the gunpowder stink of cordite. Gun smoke hung in the air. Bodies and blood were everywhere. But she had eyes only for her husband sprawled on the floor. She fell on top of him and began giving the man she loved mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Childers, at the door, surveyed the bodies and blood and saw no movement at first, heard no sound. He called out, “I’m here to help,” and after a moment, the other survivors emerged from their hiding places. The three contractors began performing triage. Childers first tried to aid Laura Webb Elody, but she didn’t respond. Then he turned to her mother, Hattie Stretz, the oldest of the victims, and he saw she could be saved. Michele Fast, more grievously injured, still had a pulse as well. The others who had been gunned down in the salon were dead and beyond help. One of the rescuers saw Sandy Fannin working on her husband and told her that it was too late, that he was gone, but she still kept trying to breathe life back into Randy. When she finally stopped, she simply sat there amid the carnage and bustle and just held him. Within minutes, police officers, firefighters and paramedics swarmed the scene. A homeless man pointed out the slumped, bleeding form of a man in his Land Rover, overlooked in the rush to aid the victims inside the salon. David Caouette still clung to life. Ambulances raced him, Fast and Stretz to Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. But Caouette and Fast would be pronounced dead within hours. Stretz, though in critical condition, would recover. The lookout Sauerwein, meanwhile, gave the first police officer to arrive at the salon a description of Dekraai, his truck, and the direction the killer took when he drove away. Many months later, in a ceremony to honor the four men who risked their lives to help save others, the Seal Beach police chief would credit Sauerwein’s timely information with leading to Dekraai’s arrest within minutes of the shooting. Outside Salon Meritage, amid the barely controlled chaos of a combined crime scene investigation and trauma rescue, Sauerwein and a gaggle of other witnesses pointed at a white pickup truck driving slowly away from the back exit of the shopping center. Incredibly, Dekraai was still in sight. A few blocks away, less than 10 minutes after the first shot rang out, a Seal Beach patrol officer, his overhead lights flashing, pulled over Dekraai. Ordered to step out of the pickup, Dekraai calmly complied, leaving his weapons and ammo in the truck, except for three leftover magazines and some loose live rounds still in his pockets. As the officer patted him down, then placed the suspect’s hands in brown paper bags to preserve evidence of gunshot residue, Dekraai said, “I know what I did.” A short time later, in an interview with Seal Beach Police Detective Gary Krogman, Dekraai admitted everything, from his phone call that morning, to his contemplation of murder while sitting at the beach, to his apparent motive: a desire for retribution for his ex-wife’s behavior and victories during the custody battle. He told the detective how he had targeted his ex-wife first, then the stylist who had testified against him, then the salon owner with his scissors in hand. As he confessed, Dekraai used their first names. (Search warrant) As for the other victims in the salon, Dekraai admitted that he just killed the rest at random. He offered an explanation of sorts to the detective for this: He simply viewed the bulk of his victims as “collateral damage.”  “What kind of sick, twisted fatherly love might that be?” By the night of Oct. 13, flowers were piled up like a crashing sea wave against the west wall of Salon Meritage, and hundreds of people had assembled there for a candlelight vigil. Friends, relatives, neighbors, youth sports teams, salon customers, even some of the good Samaritan contractors who rushed in to help – all came to pray and hug and bid farewell to the fallen. Photos were posted on the salon walls, accompanied by notes scrawled on a huge sheet of craft paper someone tacked up above the bouquets. More messages in chalk adorned the side door of the salon: “Good-bye Randy” and “RIP Friend.” The mourners had come to comfort and be comforted, but also to seek ways to help. The local fundraising had already started, on social media and in person, in time reaching $150,000 to support the families who needed help after losing a loved one at the salon. Many in town worried about the schoolboy virtually orphaned by the massacre – his mother dead, his father jailed, likely for good. Dominic had sat for hours at McGaugh Elementary, wondering why no one had come to pick him up, until finally the police arrived with terrible news. The gathering outside the salon was for him, and for all the others now bereft, because that, as any local could tell you, is the Seal Beach way. Here small-town virtue has somehow survived tucked inside the continuous urban sprawl that is Southern California, and it shows itself most in times of great sorrow and need. “Mayberry by the Sea,” the town has been called, though not often by its residents, for this is sometimes dished as a backhanded compliment with a side of snark. But Aunt Bee and the other country folk of that fictional, idyllic, black-and-white TV setting for “The Andy Griffith Show” could have learned something about the bonds of community and caring on display outside Salon Meritage this night. The warm glow of hundreds of hand-carried candles lit the scene with a wrenching beauty, the faces and tears of grieving men, women and children awash in the flickering golden light. City leaders spoke words of grief and support, and people flashed peace signs and dutifully applauded in response, but it was a teenager whose eloquent words moved the crowd most. “This tragedy will not define this city. Everyone here tonight defines this city,” proclaimed college freshman Jake Tellkamp, who had organized the vigil with a Facebook post that went viral. “I don’t want this town to be marred by this monstrosity. We will love one another like family, because there are no strangers in this town.” The next day, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, Orange County’s most powerful law-enforcement official, drove to Seal Beach. He had called a news conference to tell the community – and the national media – what investigators had learned, and what would happen next now that Dekraai was in jail. At first the D.A. was all business, vowing what prosecutors always vow in the face of monstrous violence: He would seek the death penalty for the killer. Indeed, he would seek eight sentences of death, he promised, so that none of the dead would be forgotten, no victim of what he called Dekraai’s sick and indiscriminate “revenge” left out. This was the businesslike portion of the news conference, expected and by the numbers. Then the mood changed. The D.A. began speaking of the scene inside the salon and of how each of the victims perished. He named each one in turn and gave their ages. As he spoke, their smiling pictures appeared on a screen to his left. His voice grew unsteady and halting as the litany of lives cut short went on and on. When he turned to the subject of the killer’s child, his composure fled him entirely. “While Dekraai rampaged through a salon shooting at innocent victims, the son that he professed to love was sitting in the principal’s office waiting for his mom or dad to pick him up.” At that point Rackauckas stopped and looked down at his podium, eyes wet. He had to swallow hard several times before he could resume in a shaky voice. Even the most cynical journalists in the room could see this was not lawyerly posturing or theatrics for the 6 o’clock news. Rackauckas had his own troubled childhood behind him and had been a social worker before beginning his career in the law. Now he wore the same hollow expression of grief that had been so prevalent at the nighttime vigil 12 hours earlier. The only thing missing was the candle. When he finally mastered his feelings, the district attorney said: “That little boy is a victim now. His mother has been murdered. And he has to grow up knowing that his dad is a mass murderer. … So what kind of sick, twisted fatherly love might that be?” This raw display of emotion would all be mostly lost on the nightly news. The broadcast distillation of long comments into staccato sound bites leaves little room for nuance. When his remarks shifted back to the killer, the note of compassion left the D.A.’s voice and he was all business again. He explained how he had dispensed with the normal capital case review, in which a committee of senior prosecutors ponders the evidence and the law then decides whether a death sentence or life in prison should be sought. Instead, Rackauckas had decided to make the call himself, bypassing such a review as an unnecessary delay. “There are some cases that are so depraved, so callous, so malignant that there is only one punishment that might have any chance of fitting the crime. … This is the only way our society can have anything approaching justice.” He vowed again that he would see Dekraai convicted and sentenced to die for what he had done. • • • Politicians promise things all the time, whether they have the power to make those vows come true or not. In the case of the most sensational and terrible crime in his jurisdiction in many years, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas appeared to have everything he needed to keep that promise, and then some. Indeed, by the time of that news conference in Seal Beach, the People of the State of California v. Scott Evan Dekraai had become what lawyers call a “slam dunk” – a case as likely to end in prosecutorial victory as Kobe Bryant in his prime was likely to score when he held the ball above the rim. Few big cases are put together so quickly and completely as this one. There was no painstaking canvassing for witnesses. No mystery about who did what. No fears that a suspect had not been read his Miranda rights or that he had been coerced into confession. Just the opposite. Within hours of the murders, investigators had more than a dozen witnesses inside and outside the hair salon who had identified Dekraai as the gunman. They had weapons registered to him used in eight killings and one wounding – weapons found with him in his truck moments after the crime. Bullets of the same type used in the murders were found stuffed in his pockets. They had gunshot residue on his hands, witnesses to swear he had previously threatened his ex-wife and a prior record of violence. His own stepfather had gotten a restraining order against him, a quick check of court records had revealed. There was even a motive: Dekraai’s anger and desire for revenge over the custody battle for his son, his many claims that Michelle Fournier was an unfit parent, that she barraged him with harassing phone calls. He had grilled his son about his ex-wife’s behavior so hard that he would burst into tears. “If you are crying, you’re lying,” the father told him. And still there was more. Dekraai had confessed. Calmly, voluntarily, having been read his rights, Dekraai admitted his crimes. He had proclaimed, moments after his arrest, that he knew what he had done. There were signs of premeditated murder, established through both his actions and his admissions. He had taken pains to assemble his arsenal, armored himself against gunshots, then paused in his 20-minute drive from his home to the salon to sit on the beach and think about killing his ex-wife. California law holds that premeditation can occur mere moments before the crime, consisting simply of deciding to kill before pulling the trigger. Just a second of reflection is all that’s needed to satisfy the legal requirement of premeditated, or first-degree, murder. But this legal concept can be hard for lay people on juries to accept, because it still seems sudden and impulsive to them. In the Dekraai case, though, the premeditation leading up to the bloodbath at Salon Meritage occurred as Hollywood portrays it in film: It happened miles and hours in advance of the crime, cold and calculated. In short, the evidence against Dekraai after 48 hours appeared as good as it gets for the prosecution in a murder case, and as hopeless as it could be for whatever defense attorney inherited the most hated man in Orange County as a client. And yet, out of the public view, prosecutors were afraid that their quarry would elude justice. It had happened before.  “The authorities did not play by these rules.” In 1976, another mass murderer had struck in Orange County, a crime as shocking and reviled in its day as the Salon Meritage massacre is today. Indeed, until Scott Dekraai came along, the seven people shot to death during a rampage at Cal State Fullerton had been the worst case of mass murder in county history. The culprit in that case, Edward James Allaway, now 76, avoided a murder conviction because he was diagnosed as a delusional paranoid schizophrenic. It is fair to say that prosecutors generally abhor the insanity defense, which they usually attack in court as a ploy and a dodge of responsibility. In Allaway’s case, multiple medical experts agreed that he was insane at the time of his crimes. A custodian at the Fullerton campus library, Allaway had delusions that led him to conclude that people at the university had been forcing his estranged wife (who left him after he allegedly assaulted and raped her) to perform in pornographic movies. With a semi-automatic rifle he bought at a local Kmart, he moved through the library lobby and basement media room systematically killing six library workers and a professor emeritus, and wounding two other staff members. Then he drove to a hotel in Anaheim where his wife worked, phoned the police and said, “I went berserk at Cal State Fullerton, and I committed some terrible act. I’d appreciate it if you people would come down and pick me up. I’m unarmed, and I’m giving myself up to you.” The Orange County jurors who heard his case found he had committed the murders, but deadlocked on the question of his mental state during the sanity phase of the trial. The prosecution and defense agreed that the judge hearing the case should make the determination instead of a retrial. Superior Court Judge Robert Kneeland – who had occupied Rackuackas’ office as district attorney before he was appointed to the bench – found Allaway not guilty by reason of insanity. By law, people who are so delusional that they cannot understand the nature of their actions or that what they have done is wrong cannot be convicted – a legal principle dating back to an insane man’s attempt to assassinate the prime minster of Britain in 1843. Such people, however, can be committed to mental treatment as a danger to others, which Judge Kneeland did, predicting that Allaway likely never would be cured or released. Allaway has been held and treated in secure state mental hospitals ever since. Despite the judge’s prediction, his doctors have proclaimed Allaway cured repeatedly during the last 15 of the 40 years he’s been locked away. They recommended that he be moved to a community setting. The Orange County district attorney’s determined opposition, both in court and through lobbying in Sacramento, has blocked Allaway’s release. He is legally entitled to try for freedom again every year, and his efforts to be freed have kept the case fresh in the minds of prosecutors, a constant, nagging fear. Now the fear that history could repeat itself colored the Dekraai investigation. True, insanity is rarely invoked as a criminal defense and is even more rarely successful (used in less than 1 percent of cases and failing three out of four times it’s tried). And California law has changed since Allaway’s trial, making the insanity defense more difficult to mount. Yet, as strong as the factual, physical and eyewitness evidence seemed to be against Dekraai – just as it had been against Allaway – the possibility of an insanity defense haunted the case from the start. Dekraai’s ex-wife had stated in court documents that he was bipolar. He had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his 2007 tugboat accident, when a metal cable killed a fellow crewman and nearly severed one of Dekraai’s legs. And in his first appearance in court, Dekraai’s lawyer complained that jailers had failed to provide the anti-psychotic drugs that had previously been prescribed for him. As courtroom spectators jeered and shouted, “I hate you!” at the defendant, garbed in his mustard-yellow jail outfit, his attorney said he needed Topamax, a drug prescribed for seizures and migraines, and trazodone, used to treat depression. The lawyer also wanted Dekraai to have access to a spinal-cord stimulator he needed for the injuries that still plagued him from the 2007 accident. Prosecutors saw this as laying the groundwork for an insanity defense intended to explain away Dekraai’s actions as the product of delusion and disease. Rackauckas said after the hearing that he would not be surprised by such a move. At his Seal Beach news conference, the district attorney already seemed to be anticipating this, urging the public not even to try to find an explanation for Dekraai’s actions. “When good people see evil they try to reconcile why a person would do such an incomprehensible thing,” he said. “This mass murder … will never be understood.” Rackauckas and his team were determined that Scott Dekraai would not go the same route as Edward Allaway. They wanted evidence to counter a possible insanity defense, clearing the path to a first-degree murder conviction and death sentence. They were certainly entitled, perhaps even obliged, to do so. It was the way they went about gathering that evidence that would be the problem – not just for the Dekraai case, but for the entire Orange County justice system. Mental illness does not in itself qualify as legal insanity, and prosecutors already had evidence about Dekraai’s mental state in hand. They could argue that his actions and words before, during and after the killings were the subject of rage, not delusion, and so distinct from the hallucinatory perceptions of a Charles Allaway. Dekraai’s words at the time of his arrest – “I know what I did” – could be interpreted as a refutation of the legal test for legal insanity. The expert witnesses – the legions of mind and brain physicians and scientists hired in such cases – would take it from there. Based on national statistics, the odds were against a successful insanity plea. Dekraai and his legal team reached the same conclusion: He would never try to pursue an insanity defense. Instead, he would eventually plead guilty in May 2014 to eight counts of murder, leaving open only one question (for which his mental state would be only one factor to consider): Would he get life in prison without parole or a trip to death row? In hindsight, then, all investigators and prosecutors had to do to ensure conviction and the speedy justice promised to the victims was to play by the rules and let the justice system take its course. From the point of view of Dekraai’s lawyer, there were two main rules that mattered. First, the authorities had to make sure all the relevant evidence in the case – especially evidence that would help Dekraai – got turned over to the defense. And the second rule was that Dekraai’s constitutional rights had to be protected, which meant he could not be interrogated in jail by the authorities – or by people working for them – once he had an attorney. The authorities did not play by these rules. One day after the district attorney’s stirring news conference, outside the view of the public and the TV cameras, sheriff’s deputies quietly moved Dekraai to a new location within the teeming Orange County Jail system: Cell No. 3 of Sector 17 in Module L, a psychiatric evaluation unit in the processing hub known as the Intake Release Center. Informally, Tank 17 had become a “snitch tank,” a place where investigators hoped to glean incriminating statements from Dekraai. Rackauckas would later say it was a coincidence, but the first person to befriend this newcomer to the Darwinian culture of the corrections system was a professional informant working for police and prosecutors in an array of cases. This Mexican Mafia gang leader had been busily informing on other inmates for some time, gathering evidence against them so he could reduce his own life sentence. Many cases got the secret snitch tank treatment over the years, and the Dekraai case followed the same basic script: Secretly, after Dekraai had retained his attorney, investigators began to tape as their informant coaxed Dekraai to open up. Then they failed to turn over key evidence to the defense for months. (Read Judge Goethals’ initial ruling) The consequences of these tactics, once exposed by the dogged efforts of Dekraai’s attorney, would have the opposite effect than intended. Instead of making the Dekraai prosecution stronger, revelations about the snitch tank and the misconduct of law enforcement became the focus of the case, drawing such national news organizations as “60 Minutes” to town and eclipsing the story of the man who had killed so many. Then the prosecutions of other crimes were called into question – and in some cases were undone – by the unfolding scandal arising from how the justice system in Orange County used and covered up its system of jailhouse informants. Meanwhile, the speedy justice Rackauckas had promised in that emotional news conference in Seal Beach has been delayed for years. As New Year’s 2016 arrived, the families and friends of the Salon Meritage victims remained in limbo and anguish, waiting for the case – and their lives – to move on.  “They trusted me … They just kind of opened up.” Inside the Orange County Jail, the barracks and modules are crowded. Thick doors, concrete walls and floors, and ubiquitous security monitors create a forbidding environment. This is no accident. Prisoner movements are carefully controlled. Inmates wear color-coded wristbands to aid in segregating them into a kind of a tribal system based on risk and vulnerability – separating enemy and target, predator and prey. The goal is to limit violence. First-time offenders, or “white banders,” typically are housed in large, open dormitories. Yellow-band inmates are repeat offenders, while members of orange- and red-band tribes are hardened career criminals, housed in high-security modules where they seldom leave their cells. An inmate earns a red band for attacking his captors. A substantial number of inmates in lockup wear blue bands, signifying protective custody. This group includes gay inmates, high-profile or celebrity defendants, and prisoners known by other inmates to have worked previously as informants. All are likely prey in the violent criminal culture that rules the inner life of any lockup. Scott Dekraai was two days shy of his 42nd birthday when he was transferred into Tank 17 with a blue band on his wrist and a target on his back, though he was not targeted for violence. He was a jackpot, a target for informants looking for an edge. Angry and classified as a “total sep” in protective custody – meaning he was to be totally separated from other prisoners for his and their protection – Dekraai could not even mingle in the large, open day rooms adjoining each double tier of cells. His status made him an outcast. Still, the balding, 6-foot-1, 285-pound Dekraai fell into a fast and seemingly unlikely friendship with an inmate in the cell next to him. The two men exploited a well-used jailhouse communications device: talking back and forth through their sinks, letting the plumbing channel their voices. Dekraai’s new friend was one Fernando Perez, a 30-year-old who was physically slight, just 5-foot-6 and unimposing, but nonetheless a rising figure in the leadership ranks of the feared Mexican Mafia gang. Perez admits to acts of violence that include making hit lists of people his gang should kill on sight and jumping on a man’s head, smashing it into the ground. “When you’re a gang member in prison, you have no choice,” he would later testify. “It’s either do or be done.” But there was a third way: Working for the man. When he met Dekraai, Perez faced a third-strike charge of illegal possession of a firearm that could put him in prison for life. By then he was working virtually full time helping law enforcement collect information to bolster cases against dozens of defendants, from run-of-the-mill crooks to highly sought-after leaders of the Mexican Mafia. He took prolific and surprisingly literate notes daily, then passed them on to the officials who could make his life sentence go away. So rather than shun or ignore the limping mass murderer in the next cell, Perez nurtured a rapport. He fetched water for Dekraai’s tea. He affectionately called him “buddy” and “brother.” And whatever else he said and did before the recordings began, Perez got Dekraai talking. He has a way of gaining inmates’ trust, he asserted much later during a hearing, when he insisted his technique boiled down to being a sympathetic listener who never stepped into unconstitutional territory by asking questions like a cop. “I don’t know what it is about me,” he said of his success in getting criminals to incriminate themselves. “They trusted me. … They just kind of opened up.” On Oct. 18, 2011, one of the “special handling” deputies at the jail charged with monitoring informants called the District Attorney’s Office. According to a slide presentation on the case prepared by prosecutors, the deputy said, “A guy in here (who has provided good info before) tells me that the Seal Beach shooter is bragging about the crime. … I think you’d be interested to hear what he has to say.” The prosecutor who took the call reportedly replied, “What could it hurt to go take a listen?” The next day, a week after Dekraai’s arrest, at 5:37 p.m., members of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department, which operates the jail system, began recording the dialogue between Perez and Dekraai. An instruction in the inmate records, filed nearly a week after Dekraai’s arrival in Tank 17, said he was not to be moved regardless of medical requests without the permission of special-handling deputies, who manage the informant network. That allowed the recording of about 130 hours of conversation. According to the D.A.’s office, prosecutors instructed Perez “not to ask defendant questions about his case.” Dekraai’s attorney and, later, the judge hearing the case would assert that this instruction was not followed. By having Dekraai’s own words on tape, prosecutors and investigators hoped to avoid any suspicion that Perez was fabricating testimony about what he had heard in order to earn a break on his own case. Prosecutors planned to play the tapes for jurors without them ever seeing Perez. The tapes would “speak for themselves.” Defense lawyers do not like this scenario. They like to have the frequently unsavory informant live and in person, questioning them about their gang activities and crimes, and what they hope to gain out of tricking and betraying other inmates. Perez could be asked, for example, how he earned his gang moniker: Wicked. None of the contents of those recorded conversations have been publicly disclosed, although prosecutors have said in court that they capture Dekraai making comments that seem to “brag” about the killings he committed. Jailhouse informants are part of an uncomfortable symbiosis: prisoners serving the very people who lock them up, risking brutal retribution – even death – in aid of the enemy. Some live like kings behind bars. They break the code of the streets by offering up dirt on other inmates who are sometimes their friends. Yet it happens daily. Desperate to get out, snitches find their treachery can earn them extra privileges, better treatment, lesser charges or reduced sentences for their own crimes, though this is rarely made explicit. That way informants can testify that they were promised nothing in exchange for their assistance, making it harder for their credibility to be assailed on the witness stand. Contrary to common belief and Hollywood portrayals, snitches are rarely prisoners who just happen to overhear a confession. Jailhouse informants apply for the role, as if seeking employment. If a would-be informant gets the job, he’s logged into an informant database. In Orange County, informants are supposed to be assigned to no fewer than two handlers each, who guide their contacts with other inmates and receive their information dumps in the form of notes and reports. Each informant must sign documents stating he is not a member of law enforcement and has not been promised any rewards in exchange for evidence he might collect, according to Lt. William Baker, who supervises the informant program for the Sheriff’s Department’s Special Investigations Bureau. Despite such disclaimers, some informants serve again and again over weeks or months, essentially functioning as spies for law enforcement inside the jailhouse. Sometimes a snitch helps strategize the intelligence gathering. Others become prolific correspondents, filing dozens or even hundreds of pages of confidential notes – scrawled records in which the petty jealousies and political squabbles between inmates and gangs play out like never-ending crime dramas. Usually those records remain hidden from the public, even as they help further police investigations and bolster criminal prosecutions. The Sheriff’s Department keeps most of its informant operation well-concealed, citing its responsibility to safeguard informants and their families from retribution – and to preserve its only means of penetrating the inner circle of criminal organizations, such as the notorious prison gang called the Mexican Mafia. No one will say, for example, how many informants are housed among the nearly 6,000 inmates in the county’s five jails. Prisoners suspect, rightly or wrongly, that the number is substantial. “It’s like they’re breeding them here,” said David Neal, who was housed at the Intake Release Center where Dekraai and Perez had their encounters. Neal, who was defending himself against charges of carjacking and robbery, said of the snitches, “They are everywhere, dude.” Snitches can deliver big results. Informants working out of the Orange County jail system played a critical role in two big gang busts by a federal-local task force that targeted the Mexican Mafia – a task force that employed Perez. The first bust, code named Operation Black Flag, broke three months before Dekraai arrived at the jail and led to the indictments of almost 100 alleged gang members, including two suspected kingpins fighting for control of the Mexican Mafia in Orange County. They were undone by the seizure of a unique form of jailhouse communication called the kite – thin strips of paper crinkled up tinier than cigarette butts and smuggled from cell to cell. The second big bust two years later, Operation Smokin’ Aces, led to the indictment of 129 more gang defendants on charges of murder, assault, extortion and racketeering. Informants have always been around, for they can go places, hear things, and penetrate the inner sanctums of crime in a way no cop, uniformed or undercover, ever can. But in Orange County, snitches have become part of the fabric of the justice system, not merely haphazard and opportunistic rogue elements, but as an orderly, tracked, secret workforce prowling the jail with very specific targets in mind. Oscar Moriel, for example, started informing in the jails in 2009 and was a key figure in both the big Mexican Mafia operations. He wanted to get out of a life sentence for his own crimes. Over time, Moriel stopped being a mere conduit of information and started directing investigations. When targeting one murder defendant, Moriel suggested they be put in a disciplinary isolation unit next to each other so they could bond as fellow troublemakers. With another inmate in for murder, the snitch suggested phony paperwork be crafted that depicted Moriel as a problem inmate who had assaulted jail guards. When his target saw that, any suspicion that Moriel might be a snitch would evaporate, the informant suggested. Later, as problems in the snitch tank were exposed through the Dekraai case, Moriel would figure prominently in several other cases upended because of prosecutorial or investigative lapses. The motivations of informants vary. “Sometimes it’s revenge. Sometimes it’s somebody that’s scorned,” says Santa Ana Police Chief Carlos Rojas, whose department was part of the gang task force. “Sometimes they might want consideration based on criminal charges they’re facing. Sometimes it could be money. Any motivation that a human being could want … could be in that spectrum.” The word “consideration” is key in the informant trade. Less than a promise and never formalized as a contract, it is nonetheless the coin of the realm in the snitch tank. An informant who delivers can expect extra consideration when his case is reviewed or cells are assigned or work details are organized. Consideration is, for lack of a better word, the jailhouse custom. The snitches know it will come, because without it, the informant army would desert. Yet the setup provides sufficient cover to allow both law enforcement and its informants to say that no promises were made and no deals were cut. Informants on the street often want police to give them money – sometimes thousands of dollars. In the jailhouse, some snitches command special consideration – cable TV, special deliveries of Del Taco – but the primary objective is always freedom. That was the “consideration” that drove Fernando “Wicked” Perez to chat up Dekraai through the plumbing in the snitch tank. It was the district attorney’s misfortune that the assistant public defender who inherited Dekraai as a client a few weeks after the Seal Beach shooting also happened to represent another notorious murder defendant facing trial in Orange County. To the attorney’s surprise, he found that the same prolific informant popped up in both cases. And that’s when Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders began to dig.  “No way could that be a coincidence.” When Scott Sanders took on representation of the worst mass murderer in Orange County history, it didn’t take long for him to conclude that he had a loser of a case on his hands. Despite the years he would ultimately devote to Scott Dekraai, Sanders harbored no illusions on the question of guilt or innocence. Such is the lot of public defenders. Most of their clients are found guilty. Indeed, most of them plead guilty, usually in exchange for some measure of leniency. Such dealmaking is the vital lubricant that keeps the justice system from screeching to a halt, as would happen if everyone demanded a full-blown jury trial. In California, only 3 percent of felony cases end up in front of juries; in Orange County, that figure is 2.4 percent. And still the courts are crowded and backlogged. Not that this meant Sanders had little to do in the case against Dekraai. On the contrary: Sanders set out to fight fiercely over the one issue in this case that he could contest: the sentence. Prosecutors count convictions as victories. And while public defenders prize their occasional acquittals, they also celebrate life sentences in capital cases, even those without possibility of parole. Life trumps death in the high-stakes battlefield of a murder case, especially when the D.A. himself has staked his reputation on it. There are two ways to stave off a death sentence. The usual method relies on garnering sympathy from jurors by focusing on the killer’s redeeming qualities (if there are any), usually coupled with some compelling social or psychological explanation for what he or she did. The second way is to put the government on trial. While prosecutors and investigators used a jailhouse informant in the hope of countering an anticipated insanity “explanation” for Dekraai’s terrible choice on Oct. 12, 2011, Sanders focused on the story behind the informant. For that, he needed the government to turn over the information it had gathered in its investigation. This has been required ever since prosecutors in Maryland hid evidence that a convicted murderer by the name of John L. Brady hadn’t actually committed the murder. This sufficiently outraged the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964 to instruct all prosecutors everywhere that in future, they were obliged to turn over all helpful evidence to defendants. These disclosures are now universally referred to as “Brady materials,” and judges have the authority to punish prosecutors and even free defendants when there are major violations. Brady materials are supposed to appear automatically. In Dekraai’s case, getting hold of them seemed more like pulling teeth. A few at a time. The first round of police reports and other Brady materials were tantalizing, revealing that there had been extensive and incriminating recordings of Dekraai made in jail while he talked with another inmate in the days after his arrest. The other prisoner was identified only as “Inmate F.” Then the entire recordings – 130 hours of them from inside Dekraai’s bugged cell – eventually arrived at Sanders’ office in April 2012. Inmate F remained anonymous still. The position of the D.A.’s Office was that it had no obligation to supply that information – the informant’s safety took precedence. Prosecutors had no plans to call him as a witness, they said. Dekraai’s voice on the tapes would speak for itself. The breakthrough came in the summer of 2012, when Sanders figured out the identity of Inmate F. According to training materials provided by the D.A.’s Office, one of the tapes prosecutors turned over to Sanders – a recording of their initial interview with Inmate F – had not been fully purged of identifying information. It contained the informant’s booking number and name: the Mexican Mafia leader Fernando Perez. Sanders soon realized Inmate F also was the government’s informant against another of his clients: high-profile murder defendant Daniel Wozniak, a community theater actor accused of killing two people and dismembering one of them, part of an elaborate scheme to steal money to finance his upcoming marriage. Here was yet another case heavily weighted in the prosecution’s favor with extensive evidence against Wozniak and, like Dekraai, a confession to police. Yet a jailhouse informant was involved – the same informant. No way could that be a coincidence, the lawyer decided. A professional informant had been at work on both of his cases, something that should have been disclosed right away. Instead, a judge noted, the public defender had received assurances from a senior prosecutor that no deal had been cut with Inmate F in exchange for his snitch work. Now Sanders felt certain that was untrue (and, the evidence would later show, he was right about that). (Read Judge Goethals’ ruling) Sanders demanded everything prosecutors had on Perez – his record, his casework, all his snitch notes – everything. The D.A. refused. But the judge hearing the Dekraai case ordered it turned over. And in February 2013, 16 months after Dekraai’s arrest, a window was thrown open on the snitch tank that no other defense lawyer had ever looked through. Sanders received the information mother lode: 8,000 pages about Perez’s crimes, his casework, his deals, even the 300 pages of notes he had scribbled in jail while cajoling fellow criminals to confess. (Read one of Perez’s notes) “He literally wrote down stuff every day,” Sanders later marveled. “He was working off his life case.” From the day the mother lode arrived until January 2014, almost a year later, those documents became Sanders’ life – “pretty much all I did … for every waking moment,” he said.  “The system wants to crank through the next case and the next person and Scott won’t let it happen.” With his wire-rim glasses and trim, ever-so-slightly graying beard, the man who would shake the Orange County legal system to its bedrock most resembles the math whiz who knew every answer back in high school. Scott Sanders can be charming, even funny on his own time, or so his friends say, but his public persona in court is strong-willed and tightly wound – measured, precise and intense. Youthful at 48, Sanders wears his hair longish and rolls up the sleeves of his white dress shirts. He looks, one attorney said, like a defense lawyer from central casting. The exception to that rule would be his attire during the trudge from his office to the main courthouse in Santa Ana: he’s been known to sport an Indiana Jones-style expedition hat. Here, it seems, is a man unafraid to embrace the quixotic. “The public defender usually gets steamrolled, and the most-liked public defender is the one who makes it easier for those around them,” said Case Barnett, a former colleague at the Public Defender’s Office now in private practice. “The system wants to crank through the next case and the next person and Scott won’t let it happen. … “He doesn’t understand giving up. You do what’s right, no matter the circumstance. If the rules aren’t fought for, they are going to start disappearing.” As a member of the felony unit at the Orange County Public Defender’s Office, where he has worked for 22 years, Sanders has emerged as a professional lightning rod in a way few others have dared. His ability – and willingness – to take on such epic cases stand out against the more typical burden of the public defender’s ranks. The Orange County Public Defender’s Office, which has a budget of $72.6 million, handles some 79,000 cases a year with a staff of 211 attorneys. Criminal defendants are assigned to the office if they cannot afford to hire private counsel. Many are gang members, indigents and repeat offenders, and each of the PDs is expected to churn and deal their way through hundreds of cases a year. To them, Sanders has achieved something like folk hero status. Prosecutors take a polar opposite view. “He gets and deserves no respect,” said Mark Geller, a senior deputy district attorney who has been a target of Sanders’ sweeping accusations against prosecutors. “Scott Sanders shouldn’t even be a lawyer based on the tactics he’s engaged.” On the other hand, Laura Fernandez, a senior fellow at Yale Law School who studies prosecutorial misconduct, finds it remarkable that Sanders’ revelations have surfaced through the work of a public defender, employed by the same county government that pays the prosecutors. “Many people have observed that what sets Orange County apart – aside from the profound, systemic and longstanding nature of the misconduct there – is the presence of an attorney and an office willing to take on the system they are part of.” Others fear that Orange County is but the tip of a much larger national iceberg of prosecutorial misconduct no one has yet dared to challenge. “How many other places is this happening? How many innocent people might have been railroaded in this kind of system and it hasn’t been discovered?” asked David Greenwald, executive director of the People’s Vanguard of Davis, a nonprofit group that monitors the justice system. Mindful of grieving loved ones, Sanders is careful to avoid thrusting himself into the limelight in a way that suggests a pursuit of personal glory or any other cause beyond making sure those who enforce the law are not permitted to be above the law. He’ll comment on legal aspects of the case, but he has refused to talk about his personal life and motivations. What’s known about Sanders’ background boils down to name, rank and serial number: He grew up in the Chicago area, received an undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin and attended Emory University School of Law in Atlanta. He and his wife, Priscilla Monserrate-Sanders, co-founder of a Spanish-language program for youth, live in Long Beach. With his Chicago accent, he can be heard in the halls of the Public Defender’s Office holding court on whatever holds his passion at the moment, whether it’s the latest legal ruling or the most recent Chicago Bulls game (he’s an ardent fan). Sanders’ close friend Dave Swanson, who met him in the 1990s while they were both attorneys working for the public defender, said he believes Sanders is motivated by neither fame nor career advancement. The professional skeptic is, in fact, an idealist, according to Swanson. What matters to him is the protection of the legal principles that shield ordinary citizens from the great power of prosecutors – a shield Sanders felt had grown far too thin in the Orange County justice system. “He wants to see things done properly, legally,” Swanson said of Sanders’ work on the Dekraai case. “He wants justice. He wants fair play. He wants integrity. And I think he saw none of those things.” In January 2014, Sanders filed a massive legal motion unlike any ever seen in the Orange County courthouse – 505 pages, accompanied by 15,000 pages of supporting exhibits – alleging that the Orange County Sheriff’s Department and District Attorney’s Office had systematically flouted the law and the Constitution for years by improperly using informants in jail and keeping evidence hidden from defendants. Sanders hadn’t merely found a defense for a pair of clients. He had compiled allegations of informant abuses in many cases that he said revealed a pattern of official misconduct and lack of oversight of the police by prosecutors. In a subsequent and even lengthier filing in the Wozniak murder case, Sanders alleged that the misconduct had gone on for decades, placing “a pro-prosecution thumb on the scale of justice” in Orange County. The legal motions went into painstaking detail, but the bottom line was this: When it came to the secret informant program, Sanders charged, prosecutors and the police agencies that worked under them had hidden the ball for many years. They had withheld evidence that could have helped in the defense of the accused. In the snitch tank, informants, acting as agents of the police, had interrogated defendants outside the presence of their lawyers, in violation of the law and the Constitution. Wrongful convictions had resulted, he claimed. Fernando “Inmate F” Perez was merely exhibit one in a much larger story, according to Sanders, a story in which the Dekraai and Wozniak cases were just examples of professional informants “coincidentally” ending up locked up with inmates the authorities had targeted. The abuse would continue, the defense lawyer argued, unless the authorities in Orange County were forced to change their ways. How to do that? Sanders called for an extreme solution: He petitioned to kick the D.A.’s Office off the Dekraai and Wozniak cases. And he argued that the misconduct was so great that the death penalty should be taken off the table. It is fair to say that these sweeping allegations, not to mention the proposed remedies, were met with skepticism from public, media and justice system insiders alike. “Filled with untruths,” a senior official from the D.A.’s Office proclaimed with not-so thinly veiled contempt. Most motions in criminal cases come in at fifty pages or less. Five hundred pages – “eye-bleeders” one prosecutor called them – are just asking for trouble, not least because most judges are unlikely to read them. The sweeping allegations had some hard evidence drawn from many different cases, but there was quite a bit of historical conjecture woven into the narrative as well. The original judge assigned to the Wozniak case, James Stotler, grew so frustrated with Sanders’ tactics that he removed himself from the case, no longer feeling capable of being fair to the lawyer or his client. It all seemed so unbelievable, particularly with Dekraai and Wozniak – cases where no shenanigans appeared to be needed for prosecutors to secure convictions. Then the tide turned. Bit by bit, Sanders’ charges began to gain traction in the Dekraai case. The Register began to investigate. So did other defense attorneys who began to wonder about the “coincidences” that had doomed their own clients. Prosecutors stopped making outright denials when facing off with Sanders, instead conceding that mistakes had been made on their end. Nothing on purpose. Just innocent errors, attributable to overwork, or misunderstanding of the law, or interference from the feds. Then came an admission that prosecutors had failed to turn over some Brady materials in the Dekraai case – for months. Then the D.A. conceded Sanders’ claim that the informant’s conversations with Dekraai violated his constitutional rights. Prosecutors voluntarily agreed they wouldn’t use the jailhouse recordings in trying to convict Dekraai. Even so, the D.A.’s position on the big picture remained unchanged. Prosecutors complained that Sanders had spun a few innocuous errors into some grand conspiracy that was completely untrue. But the genie was out of the bottle. In the months that followed, at least five other murder and attempted murder cases would unravel in Orange County due to problems Sanders had uncovered with informants and evidence disclosure. More cases, including some involving men on California’s death row, were being questioned. A top official in the D.A.’s Office, after months battling a controversy that just wouldn’t go away but seemed, instead, to constantly gather steam, summed up his office’s opinion of Sanders’ most serious allegations with one word: “Baloney.” That very same day, The New York Times called for a federal probe of the informant controversy in Orange County. The real turning point, however, came through the rulings of one Orange County Superior Court jurist. Judge Thomas Goethals would initially give the D.A. the benefit of the doubt. But then new revelations surfaced after he had ruled in prosecutors’ favor. His follow-up ruling would be quite different.  “He ate as any starving dog would. Thomas M. Goethals is the rare jurist who has prosecuted a capital murder case, defended a murder case, and presided over a capital case as a judge. Goethals, a defense attorney before he was a judge and a prosecutor before he was a defender, helped convict two of Orange County’s most prolific serial killers – Rodney Alcala and Randy Kraft, each of whom is awaiting execution. As an Orange County deputy district attorney, Goethals ran the same homicide unit that would later prosecute Dekraai. Trim and clean-cut, Goethals speaks with a voice both clear and emphatic. He and his wife, Patty, who met on a blind date while Goethals attended Loyola High School in Los Angeles, now live in Newport Beach. They have three grown children, including a son, Patrick, who is a lawyer in Long Beach. Goethals is a physically active, outgoing person who at times is the life of the party, said his wife. “He’s always the loudest person in the house. He loves to laugh, loves to joke.” This was not a temperament he had many opportunities to display in the Dekraai litigation. Sanders, perhaps unsurprisingly, has a tendency to try the patience of judges in Orange County, most of whom had been prosecutors themselves. But it was Goethals’ relationship with the D.A.’s Office that he once worked for and admired that was most sorely tested, particularly as his disappointment and alarm at its performance became increasingly evident through his rulings. Unlike many others in the courthouse, Goethals took Sanders’ huge legal motion seriously and read it cover to cover. Then he scheduled months of evidentiary hearings in 2014, intent on probing Orange County law enforcement’s use of jailhouse informants and allegations that prosecutors failed to turn over evidence about them to defense lawyers. Much to the district attorney’s displeasure, the judge refused to limit the evidence to just specifics of the Dekraai case, instead hearing out lengthy testimony about informants and alleged Brady violations in other cases unrelated to the 2011 Salon Meritage shootings. While this drama played out, Dekraai decided to plead guilty in April 2014 to eight murders and one attempted murder in Seal Beach. There was no deal, no offer of leniency – just an admission of responsibility for terrible crimes. Only a penalty trial remained after that to decide sentencing – unless Sanders succeeded in getting the death penalty scratched. In August 2014, Goethals reached a decision, finding prosecutors had failed to turn over evidence that would have been helpful to Dekraai, and illegally questioned him via a jailhouse informant. But the judge found that this misconduct was the result of negligence, poor training and “lack of professional energy and strategic imagination.” “The District Attorney’s well-documented failures in this case, although disappointing, even disheartening, to any interested member of this community, were negligent rather than malicious,” the judge concluded. This was the single most important sentence in Goethals’ 12-page legal opinion. For Sanders, it meant the D.A.’s lapses fell short of the “outrageous” standard he had hoped to prove. County prosecutors would not be kicked off the case, and the death penalty would stay on the table. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said the ruling supported his belief that no one in his office committed intentional misconduct. He added that his prosecutors had attended officewide training a month earlier to ensure they understand their legal obligations in the future. This was a victory for the D.A. in result, but an embarrassment in most other respects. Goethals’ written opinion was in places scathing to the Orange County district attorney, openly questioning the credibility of several members of the prosecution team and deriding the district attorney’s excuses that their negligence was due to overwork, poor legal knowledge or interference from federal officials. Everyone is overworked in the system and has to deal with other jurisdictions, the judge said, pointing out that the D.A.’s own training manuals warn prosecutors that the disclosure of Brady material is critical and must be overseen personally, diligently and completely. Yet when one senior prosecutor was confronted on the witness stand with the fact that he had disclosed four pages of material about an informant’s background in one criminal case, while providing 196 pages in another case, the prosecutor said he never noticed the discrepancy because he let a paralegal handle the task and had not checked. Goethals criticized this “cavalier” attitude as unacceptable and legally deficient. It ultimately would lead to a new trial for an accused murderer. The judge reserved his harshest critique for attempts by prosecutors to divorce themselves from responsibility for the behavior of their informant, Perez. Goethals said they were not off the hook by asserting that they had instructed Perez to refrain from questioning Dekraai and to act as a “listening post” only. Goethals brushed off that explanation as “disingenuous.” Perez made it clear to all that he would “do anything” to elude life in prison, Goethals said, and the sheriff and district attorney should have known what would happen next: “He almost immediately engaged this defendant in conversations about his case, asking questions when he felt it was necessary. Perez was not merely a ‘listening post.’” Goethals drew a harsh analogy: “The owner of a starving dog cannot evade liability for the dog’s destructive behavior inside a butcher shop by instructing that dog not to eat just before releasing him into the shop, knowing at the time that it is teeming with fresh cuts of prime beef. When released that dog is going to eat. … When Perez was ‘released’ near this defendant’s cell inside Mod L, he ate as any starving dog would.” But on two key points – ones that might have tipped the scales into outrageous territory had Sanders won them – Goethals found the evidence supported prosecutors. First, he agreed with Sanders that a prosecutor incorrectly stated early in the case that there was no leniency deal with Perez. But the judge disagreed that this was done deliberately. Instead the judge found that assurance had been made by a senior deputy D.A. who did not know the informant’s background at that time. Others in the office knew there was an arrangement with Perez in place, the judge found – the “consideration” that isn’t formally written down but that still constitutes an agreement. But the failure to communicate this to Sanders was a failure of “due diligence,” Goethals decided. The other point – whether a larger conspiracy existed in the jail to place informants next to targets so they could be illegally interrogated – did not apply to Dekraai. Goethals determined Dekraai really had been placed next to Perez by coincidence, on the order of a triage nurse who had nothing to do with the informant program in the jail. The judge did impose a sanction on the prosecution, however. He barred prosecutors from using any evidence gathered by the jailhouse snitch, even in the penalty phase of the trial. The D.A. had hoped to use the recordings to rebut any claims Dekraai made to avoid a death sentence. But the judge said no evidence obtained through misconduct would be permitted. In declining Sanders’ request to kick the D.A. off the case, Goethals sounded a hopeful note: “On balance, this court has not lost confidence that the duly elected District Attorney of this county has the ability to competently and ethically complete the prosecution of this serious matter.” That confidence would last less than seven months.  “I’m confident he sleeps like a rock and his conscience is clear because he’s done the right thing. What kind of guy is Tom Goethals? Here’s a story his wife tells: A devout man with a keen appreciation for history, he wrote to the White House so that his wife, a professional decorator and three-time cancer survivor, could help put up Christmas decorations there last fall. They traveled to Washington not long after he issued his first misconduct ruling in the Dekraai case. At the White House, volunteers climbed ladders and strung garlands. After days of work, when spouses were invited to join a dinner with first lady Michelle Obama, Goethals delighted in roaming the halls and trying out couches where so many great leaders have sat. The portrait of Abraham Lincoln hanging in the State Dining Room particularly enthralled the judge. “My husband is a Lincoln fanatic,” Patty Goethals said. Even the couple’s year-old grandson was named Lincoln. “Anything to do with Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War gives him so much joy. So he was just in heaven.” Goethals, a Loyola Law School graduate who was appointed by then-Gov. Gray Davis in 2002 (he took the bench in January 2003), is a man of relatively diverse background. He spent a dozen years as a defense lawyer in private practice, and a dozen years before that as a lawyer in the Orange County District Attorney’s Office. Growing up in Southern California, he played football in high school, spent summers body surfing and working as a driver on the Disneyland submarine ride, and took up water skiing, which he and his wife still like to do. He’s been a runner much of his life, taking part for 14 years in the annual law enforcement relay race through the desert heat from Baker to Las Vegas, a grueling trek that once melted his shoes. These days, the 63-year-old judge only jogs, Patty Goethals said. “He calls it shuffling. He needs both knees to be replaced. He’s putting off having his knees done.” Were it not for his love of law, Goethals probably would have become a history professor, his wife said. But he chose to follow the career path of his father, Richard, a noted civil attorney, and his older brother, Rick, who practiced law in San Francisco. “He has a photographic memory,” Patty Goethals said. “Tom can remember facts, details. We have a little ski boat we take out in the harbor – taking friends out on a cocktail cruise. He will talk to them about famous people who live on the bay, who ate at that restaurant, when that got built. He retains information so easily.” Such a skill serves a judge well. Goethals’ reputation in the legal community suggests he was perceived as prepared, attentive, conservative and tough on certain types of crimes, particularly violent and drug-related cases. But his reputation among prosecutors began to deteriorate as the Dekraai case wore on. In early 2014, around the time Goethals decided to hold extensive hearings on Sanders’ misconduct allegations, prosecutors began to “paper” the judge. That’s the slang term for invoking a provision of California law that gives defense and prosecution one opportunity each to request a different judicial assignment for their cases. Such requests are routine but rarely organized into the sort of campaign that Orange County prosecutors carried out. They began blanketing Goethals with paper, having him removed in 46 of 49 murder cases assigned to his courtroom between February 2014 and September 2015. In the four years prior, Goethals had been removed by prosecutors from only one case. The county’s supervising felony judge, Richard King, declared the blanket papering had disrupted the flow of cases in the Orange County court system. King began denying the prosecution’s requests to remove Goethals from cases in December 2015 – a move the D.A. is now appealing as improper. Goethals’ admirers have risen to his defense. Newport Beach attorney Kate Corrigan, former head of the Orange County Criminal Defense Bar Association, said prosecutors may be angry because they assumed Goethals would “rubber stamp” the results they wanted. “Judge Goethals showed he takes his oath seriously,” Corrigan said. “He has an amazing moral compass … and he is not going to put up with constitutional violations of anyone’s rights, whether he’s a gang member or accused of capital murder. … I’m confident he sleeps like a rock and his conscience is clear because he’s done the right thing.” Patty Goethals said it’s true – her husband sleeps soundly, though the intensity of the flak from the Dekraai case has troubled him. “It was difficult at first,” she said. “Tom worked for the D.A.’s Office for many years and he loves the D.A.’s Office.” • • • In March 2015, Goethals was put in the uncomfortable position of having to reconsider his earlier ruling expressing confidence in the same office he loves. Sanders had accumulated new evidence as thousands of pages of Brady material continued to trickle in long after they were supposed to have been turned over. One set of records proved to be a blockbuster, revealing the existence of a confidential inmate database at the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. This database contained detailed information on the movement of inmates in the jail, tracking where they were assigned by time, date, location and, in many cases, the reasons for the assignment. Called the TRED system, it provided, among other things, a guidebook to the movement and assignment of snitches in the jail, including evidence of whether a placement was purposeful or coincidental. When questioned under oath during the first series of hearings on Sanders’ motion, two jail deputies – special handlers who work with informants and who have logged thousands of entries in the TRED system over the years – failed to mention that such database records exist. Instead, they testified that reconstructing the movement of inmates in years past would be impossible, according to Goethals. (Read Goethals’ ruling) During the second round of hearings Goethals convened, the two deputies were pressed to explain why they remained silent about TRED. “That’s the way we were trained,” one of the deputies eventually responded. If it is possible to detect fury in a typewritten judicial opinion, it is present in Goethals’ second ruling on Sanders’ misconduct pleadings. He found that the two deputies “have either intentionally lied or willfully withheld material evidence.” “For this court’s current purposes, one is as bad as the other,” Goethals wrote. “The District Attorney is responsible for the actions of his agents. In this case, the evidence demonstrates that some of those agents have habitually ignored the law over an extended period of time to the detriment of this defendant.” The judge contended that there was no direct evidence that the D.A. or his office participated in a cover-up. But the judge asserted that this “just aggravates the entire situation.” “Someone has to be in charge of criminal investigations and prosecutions in Orange County,” he wrote. Yet, he said, the D.A. has been unwilling or unable to make sure police agencies under his direction follow the law and the rules. Evidence has stayed hidden for two years as a result, despite court orders, despite promises to do better, despite Supreme Court rulings and the Bill of Rights. And that, Goethals ruled, constitutes a conflict of interest. “Certain aspects of the District Attorney’s performance in this case might be described as a comedy of errors,” Goethals concluded, “but for the fact that it has been so sadly deficient. There is nothing funny about that.” Then he booted the D.A. off the Dekraai case and appointed the state Attorney General’s Office to pick up the pieces. The legal community was shocked. The D.A. was outraged. The attorney general vowed to appeal. And families of Dekraai’s victims at Salon Meritage felt devastated. “I very, very strongly disagree with the ruling and with much of what he had to say in his decision,” Rackauckas said. “I can’t tell you how hard our people are working trying to bring these issues to resolution. It’s very clear at this point that Judge Goethals has problems with our office. He said he’s lost trust in our office and that’s obviously a sad commentary, but I’m very much in disagreement with that point of view.” Even as the D.A. said he disagreed with Goethals’ decision, however, Rackauckas conceded his office had made “missteps” and had been “negligent,” but had not deliberately done anything wrong. “We should have done more to learn the history of the confidential informant that we were working with … in this case,” the D.A. said. “And frankly I think that’s the greatest mistake and a lot of things have resulted from that.” He added: “It was a negligent mistake on our part, but we worked to correct it. It was not in bad faith.” Sanders immediately accused the D.A. of mischaracterizing the facts. “Testimony and email presented at the hearing show it was not a lack of information about the informant, but a decision to hide that information,” he said. Rackauckas said after the ruling that his heart went out to the shooting victims’ families, but this provided small comfort. “My nightmare continues. I’m stunned, angry, frustrated,” said Paul Wilson, husband of victim Christy Wilson. “The fundamentals of the case is that he killed those eight people that day and he needs to pay for that, and now we’re going on three years and we’re starting all over again. I don’t understand it. There has to be a better answer.” As if anticipating such sentiments, Goethals’ opinion suggests where the victims’ families ought to lay blame for the lack of resolution in the Dekraai case. “The District Attorney’s conflict of interest is not imaginary. It apparently stems from his loyalty to his law enforcement partners at the expense of his other constitutional and statutory obligations. … This performance has deprived this defendant, the people of Orange County and especially the community of Seal Beach, of the timely resolution of this case which all parties deserved. And which should have, could have, and likely would have been achieved but for this performance. “Justice delayed has resulted in the denial of justice to all concerned here.” Scott Sanders had gotten everything he hoped for, except one thing: The death penalty was still on the table for Dekraai.  “I don’t feel like you guys did your job … This is just like a slap to my face. The revelations unleashed in Judge Goethals’ courtroom roiled the normally orderly world of the Orange County courthouse. Case after case that had been seemingly settled was being scrutinized because of the new information dug up by Sanders. In the wake of revelations and rulings, both the district attorney and Sheriff Sandra Hutchens have announced extensive reviews, reforms and retraining intended to make sure the offices meet all their obligations to disclose information and protect the rights of defendants in jail from improper questioning. Past problems were inadvertent, Rackauckas maintained, but he was determined to correct them. Rackauckas, an elected officeholder since 1998, has vowed to personally review all cases that involve snitches in the jail. The sheriff has created a clearinghouse for dealing with case documents and subpoenas, with a sergeant at the jail Intake Release Center in charge. In the past, the process of finding and collecting all discovery materials for defense lawyers has been complicated by the vast number of cases, investigators and agencies working within the jail system, according to sheriff’s Lt. William Baker, who oversees the informant program. Policies for dealing with other investigative agencies also have been tightened, both at the District Attorney’s Office and sheriff’s headquarters. In the past, investigators from other agencies could call up and ask jailers to introduce an informant to an inmate they had targeted. “We would facilitate this meeting,” Baker said. Under the new rules, outside agencies must keep their own detective in the jailhouse throughout the operation, Baker said. Those detectives have to conduct debriefings and write reports, not the jailers. The first two police agencies that asked for assistance after the stricter protocols were adopted both chose not to pursue it, he said. Lawyers in the District Attorney’s Office and virtually all of the sheriff’s nearly 2,000 sworn personnel are going through special training programs about informants and evidence. Assistant District Attorney Ebrahim Baytieh conducted a four-hour session for sheriff’s deputies this fall, hitting hard on themes of integrity and full disclosure and emphasizing the dangers of relying on informants. Baytieh showed a “60 Minutes” segment about notorious jailhouse snitch Leslie Vernon White, who emerged during a similar scandal in Los Angeles in the 1990s. In the film clip, White admitted to pretending to be a homicide cop and making phone calls to police and prosecutors to gather facts about cases. He used the intelligence to make persuasive claims about overhearing confessions, all in a bid to negotiate lighter sentences for himself. “It’s a marketplace,” a smirking White said on camera. “This is ‘Let’s Make a Deal.’ The only thing missing is Monty Hall.” Informants are liars until proven otherwise. Their allegations must be corroborated. Defendants have a right to disclosure even if they don’t ask for it, Baytieh told the deputies. One missing piece of paper ended up requiring the retrial of a man who murdered a police officer in Garden Grove. Baytieh showed slides of grisly crime scenes – an elderly man stabbed 83 times, a woman in her 80s who was raped, tortured and killed. Even when the crimes make you furious, when you know the accused is guilty, when you know he’s a monster who shouldn’t be back on the street, when you are feeling your most cynical about justice, you need to follow the law or you’re no better than the crook, Baytieh said. “It doesn’t matter how angry we get,” he said. “We wear our white hats in every single case.” But can the system correct itself without outside oversight? Alexandra Natapoff, a Loyola Law School professor, former federal public defender and author of the book “Snitching: Criminal Informants and the Erosion of American Justice,” worries that it cannot. She points to the reaction of the D.A. to its informant scandal as a worrisome indicator: In addition to the well-publicized reforms to the bureaucracy Rackauckas has championed, his prosecutors much more quietly have been setting criminals free. A criminal wrongly targeted by informants who gets very lenient treatment, Natapoff observes, doesn’t become the subject of highly public, highly embarrassing hearings about misconduct – like Dekraai’s. “We saw the Orange County District Attorney start to cut deals with very serious criminals – people who had committed or were charged with murder. They were getting out early. Their sentences were being cut drastically,” Natapoff said. “In effect the government was using the extraordinarily powerful tool that it has in plea bargaining to shut down the valves of information in the criminal system that would permit us to have learned more. “We can’t underestimate the power that the government has to ensure that we never learn the details of these cases where the government has engaged in misconduct.” Natapoff’s conclusion: Orange County can’t go it alone. Snitch tanks are a national problem that needs a national solution. “This,” she said, “deserves greater scrutiny.” • • • The main unknown now is just how much damage still remains to be discovered among cases handled before the revelations in the Dekraai case were aired. The litany of past cases affected so far by the new evidence continues. First, Judge Goethals acted in another case, ousting a senior deputy district attorney, Erik Petersen, from two Mexican Mafia prosecutions amid allegations that evidence was withheld from the defense. Petersen later resigned. Leonel Vega, who had been serving life in prison for a 2004 murder, had his conviction vacated and received the right to a new trial because Orange County prosecutors failed to give his lawyer hundreds of pages of evidence about prolific jailhouse informant Oscar Moriel. The informant claimed Vega had confessed to him. Prosecutors later offered the 34-year-old Vega a plea bargain, which he accepted; he could be released as soon as 2019. Isaac John Palacios admits he shot and killed a rival gang member, pulling the trigger at least 15 times in a Santa Ana driveway, and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, a crime that often carries a life sentence. Yet the 30-year-old gang member walked free a few hours after the plea; the reduced sentence came because the Orange County District Attorney’s Office had failed to disclose information on the same informant as in the Vega case, Oscar Moriel. Among the information never turned over: Three other inmates had supposedly confessed to the same killing. Prosecutors also dropped charges against Palacios in a second gang killing. The lead prosecutor said they had offered time served to a killer in part to avoid another Dekraai hearing, and also to preserve Moriel as a viable witness in other cases. The sister of the victim wasn’t buying this. “I don’t feel like you guys did your job,” she told the court. “This person is completely laughing, walking away. … And my brother’s dead. … This is just like a slap to my face.” Attempted murder and gun charges were dropped against white supremacist gang member Joseph Martin Govey after a judge ordered that informant evidence be disclosed in the case. Govey, a fleeing parolee-at-large at the time of his arrest in August 2011, was accused of soliciting the death of an informant. Rather than release the information, prosecutors dropped the case. Bryant Islas was given a six-year sentence for attempted murder in a plea deal that was struck after the debate over jailhouse informants became public, according to his attorney. Islas, 31, was facing up to life in prison before the deal ended a case in which he allegedly tried to kill a street gang rival. With credit for time served, he’ll be out in 2016. Eric Ortiz, convicted of gunning down a man in Santa Ana in 2006, though not arrested until 2011, was granted a new trial after four sheriff’s deputies who work with jailhouse informants asserted their Fifth Amendment rights against self incrimination rather than testify. Superior Court Judge Richard King ruled that Ortiz could not get a fair trial if the deputies wouldn’t cooperate. Two of the four deputies were the pair Judge Goethals excoriated in the Dekraai case. Meanwhile, Daniel Wozniak, the double murderer represented by Sanders, lost his bid for a repeat of the Dekraai ruling. The judge on his case, Superior Court Judge John Conley, criticizing Sanders’ tactics, found no prosecutorial errors and no reason to remove the D.A.’s Office from the case. In December, an Orange County jury found Wozniak guilty of double murder charges; the following month, jurors recommended a death sentence. And then there is William Charles Payton, a notorious Orange County killer who was sentenced to death 33 years ago. Payton is among the first in line scheduled to die if and when executions resume in California – unless his becomes the oldest case caught up in the Orange County snitch scandal through allegations made by Sanders. The latest twist in the long-running Payton case started more than three decades ago with a habitual drug dealer and petty criminal by the name of Daniel Escalera, locked away in the Orange County Jail. Escalera spent his time in lockup on the hunt, and his weapon was the Bible. His quarry: the man in the adjoining cell, William Charles Payton, awaiting trial for the rape and bloody stabbing murder of a young woman in Garden Grove. Escalera spent day after day ingratiating himself with Payton. They conversed daily about Christ. They read the Scriptures together. And, unbeknownst to Payton, Escalera spent the entire time gathering information. He was a jailhouse informant who would turn from cellblock friend to star witness in the penalty portion of Payton’s 1982 trial. The prolific snitch’s testimony about Payton’s “severe problem” with women and sex helped put Payton on death row for one of the most vicious crimes of the era. Now the old case looms as a battleground again, another in a spate of seemingly resolved cases that have drawn new scrutiny due to the ongoing  controversy. The issue is the same with Payton as it was with Dekraai: Did prosecutors follow the law in disclosing evidence about informants, or did they hide the ball? For Payton, now 61, the question is of mounting urgency. He is high on the list of condemned felons in California – and the next in line from Orange County – eligible to receive a lethal injection. Nine years after the last convicted killer was put to death here, state officials in December unveiled a new, single-drug protocol that could result in executions resuming as soon as next year. For almost two decades, Payton has alleged a cover-up of information about Escalera that could have helped his case at trial and sentencing, according to Payton’s habeas corpus attorney, Margo Rocconi. Even now, Orange County prosecutors have balked at turning over vital informant records, Rocconi alleges. Mike Jacobs, a former Orange County prosecutor involved in the Payton case and now in private practice, said he followed the law and was vindicated in appellate court. “I never willfully withheld any evidence in the Payton matter,” Jacobs said. “That was adjudicated in a federal writ of habeas 16 years ago. If she wants to relitigate it again, she may try,” he said about Rocconi, “but Payton has already exhausted his state and federal remedies.” Payton was convicted of exceptionally brutal crimes. Physical evidence and eyewitness testimony tied him to the rape and murder of Pamela Montgomery, a 21-year-old woman stabbed a dozen times at a home in Garden Grove. Payton also was convicted of trying to murder two others who were present in the hours before dawn in May 1980: Patricia Pensinger, who survived 40 stab wounds, and Pensinger’s 10-year-old son, Blaine, who was stabbed 23 times but lived. As in the Dekraai and Wozniak cases, the key question from the outset was whether Payton would be sentenced to death. Escalera’s testimony, coupled with the heinous nature of the crime and testimony from other witnesses, including one of Payton’s ex-girlfriends, prevailed over the defense’s argument that Payton’s life should be spared because of his religious transformation while imprisoned, appellate records state. In his 752-page legal motion filed in the Wozniak case, Sanders cited the Payton death penalty conviction and the informants involved as an example of what he called a “bottomless well of jailhouse informant concealment.” He contends that the complete story about the informants’ backgrounds and their close relationship with prosecutors never got to Payton or his defense team and therefore never was told to the jury. Five years after Payton’s last appeal – and nearly a quarter-century after Payton’s trial – Escalera signed a handwritten declaration in which he finally laid out the full scope of his work for law enforcement. The 2006 declaration, obtained by the Register, indicated that he was not just any other cellmate. Besides being an informant for the Orange County Sheriff’s Department and District Attorney’s Office, Escalera also worked as an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. The Fullerton Police Department considered him so vital to its drug-enforcement operations that detectives provided Escalera with an apartment he used while out of jail, in addition to giving him free food stamps, according to the declaration. From 1977 to 1982, Escalera wrote, “I considered myself to be working as a government agent at all times.” Escalera also said in his signed statement that he expected – and was later given – leniency for felony charges against him, including a 1981 armed robbery, in exchange for his informant testimony. Payton’s new attorney, Rocconi, has obtained the declarations, but she still wants prosecutors to turn over Escalera’s Criminal Informant Index card, or CII, which could indicate, for example, whether Escalera was considered a reliable informant. Although Payton has exhausted his death penalty appeals, Rocconi said she may seek to reopen the case and is weighing legal action against the District Attorney’s Office. Rewarding informants is always a tradeoff and a risk, because it often requires granting freedom to one criminal in exchange for convicting another. In the case of Escalera, the trade-off would prove disastrous to a gas station attendant and his family after Escalera’s sentence of up to eight years for robbery was reduced to probation. A few months later, he fatally shot a gas station attendant during an early morning altercation. The star informant had become a killer. Said former prosecutor Jacobs: “It’s a prosecutor’s worst nightmare.” • • • In November 2015, more than three dozen legal experts and ex-prosecutors called for a federal investigation into allegations that Orange County prosecutors and sheriff’s officials improperly used jailhouse informants and withheld evidence from defense attorneys. The group, including former Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti (whose office weathered its own quite similar snitch scandal years ago) and former Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Drooyan, penned a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch calling attention to a “crisis” in the county’s justice system. “Compelling evidence of pervasive police and prosecutorial misconduct in Orange County … has caused us grave concern,” they wrote in the 25-page letter. “It is fair to say that the criminal justice system in Orange County is in a state of crisis: charges in extremely serious cases have been reduced or dismissed; violent crimes – including murders – have gone entirely uninvestigated; to date, four law enforcement officers have refused to testify in pending criminal matters, citing their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; and at least one prosecutor has been found by a court to have given ‘incredible’ testimony under oath. More troubling still, this all appears to be the tip of the iceberg.” Susan Kang Schroeder, chief of staff for Rackauckas, said the letter seemed to be cobbled from defense legal briefs and what she characterized as inaccurate news accounts, not from the complete court filings. “Our position has always been, and will continue to be, we welcome any scrutiny and input from any law enforcement agency who wants to come in,” Schroeder said. Sheriff Hutchens also said her agency would cooperate with any federal investigation, although she added it would be prudent to wait for the outcome of the state probe. Hutchens said her department has learned from its mistakes. “During the court proceedings over the last several months, we have identified and acknowledged operational deficiencies and responded with immediate corrective action to include revised policies and improved training,” she said. The office of California Attorney General Kamala Harris is investigating local prosecutors and police over the use of informants at Rackauckas’ request. The same office has appealed Judge Goethals’ ouster of the D.A.’s Office from the case and wants the local office reinstated. Among those signing the letter calling for a federal probe was Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, and former California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who said the feds should stop watching from the sidelines. “Failure to turn over exculpatory evidence can lead to wrongful convictions. Without a comprehensive investigation, we’ll never know how many convictions were wrongfully obtained in Orange County,” Van de Kamp said. “At the same time, serious cases there appear to have been minimized by or tainted by the practices of the two agencies. In one case a defendant (Leonel Vega) sentenced to life without parole for murder now faces less than four years in prison because of law enforcement misconduct.”  “The question isn’t who to blame,but what happened and how do we fix it. As Orange County’s top law enforcement official, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas is the most obvious fall guy for the informant scandal, as Judge Goethals noted in March 2015 when he removed the D.A.’s office from the Dekraai case. Blaming Rackauckas, however, does not fully address the deeper question of why the jailhouse informant issue blew up in Orange County – why, of all places, the controversy happened here. It also begs the question of where the checks and balances were, and what safeguards, if any, must now be put in place. “Systematic problems don’t happen unless all parts of the system fall asleep at the switch,” said Miriam Krinsky, a former federal prosecutor and past member of both the Los Angeles Citizens’ Commission on Jail Violence and the Los Angeles Ethic Commission. She also signed the letter calling for a federal investigation. “The question isn’t who to blame,” Krinsky said, “but what happened and how do we fix it. That’s the only way it will move beyond the blame game.” Available evidence so far suggests that law enforcement agencies, operating with unchecked power, and motivated to obtain convictions, lacked the political will or the bureaucratic mechanisms to protect the rights of the accused, said Natapoff, the Loyola law professor. This was essentially what Goethals concluded when he ousted Orange County prosecutors from the Dekraai case: They simply couldn’t cope with the conflict between policing their police partners and making sure defendants rights were protected. In an interview, Sheriff Hutchens acknowledged responsibility for any wrongful actions that might have occurred in the jails, especially those involving the interaction of jailhouse informants with other inmates. “In hindsight, yeah, I think we needed to have stronger controls in place,” she said, while stopping short of admitting any specific transgressions pending the ongoing state Attorney General’s probe. The controversy has unfolded against the backdrop of a politically conservative county that has long prided itself on being tough on crime. Home to a thriving tech sector, Disneyland and beachside enclaves brimming with yachts, this is the ambitious, self-absorbed culture that gave rise to television’s “The O.C.” and “The Real Housewives of Orange County.” Widespread affluence belies the fact that the sprawling county was mired in a government bankruptcy a generation ago and is infested, in poorer pockets, with a serious gang problem and related drug trafficking and violence. The Orange County Jail, with its hive of informants, is itself located in a community, Santa Ana, with a major criminal gang presence. And yet, compared to people in urban regions such as San Francisco, where social activism abounds, residents of Orange County seem to care little about constitutional ideals or other serious issues, said attorney Gary L. Chambers, a past president of the Orange County Trial Lawyers Association. “They care about their cars, their houses, their clothes, their kids, where their kids go to school, where they vacation,” Chambers said. At group events here, he said, “If I get into society rights at all, you watch their eyes glass over.” What public consciousness exists here tilts heavily toward keeping the streets safe, not ensuring protections for jail prisoners, said defense attorney Jeffrey Friedman. “Orange County has been the hotbed of tough-on-crime policies and legislation ever since I’ve been here, and I’ve been here since ’73,” Friedman said. Newport Beach civil rights attorney Richard Herman, who successfully sued the county over conditions at the jail under former Sheriff Brad Gates, said he attended a community meeting in Anaheim a few years ago after the police shooting of some Latino youths. Rackauckas was there, along with various judges and lawyers, Herman remembered. “When someone said, ‘Kill all the gang members,’” the attorney recalled, “various not-to-be-named judges stood up and applauded.” Now critics question why the D.A. and other Orange County authorities failed to learn lessons from the jailhouse informant scandal in Los Angeles. “Didn’t they get the memo?” asked Natapoff, who joined in the request for a federal investigation of Orange County. “We … had the biggest jailhouse snitch problem in the country, in history, and the biggest investigation ever” in Los Angeles, she said, “and 45 minutes away it’s as if it never happened.” Officials say they are in fact responding, as witnessed by the reforms imposed by both the D.A. and the sheriff on the informant program and the machinery of compiling evidence that must be turned over to defendants as they prepare their cases. Critics, however, question whether in-house reforms will be enough when the fundamental role of the district attorney – to fairly uphold the law – seems at odds with the day-to-day political pressure to obtain convictions. Chemerinsky, the UCI Law School dean, said that the ultimate duty of seeking justice is sometimes forgotten and that “prosecutors’ enormous power – at times unchecked power – leads to abuses.” • • • The case that started it all, the prosecution of Scott Dekraai for the murders at Salon Meritage in Seal Beach in October 2011, remains in limbo. Dekraai has pleaded guilty, but the penalty trial that will determine his fate remains unscheduled as the attorney general appeals the removal of the D.A. from the case. That could take a year or more. The survivors of that terrible day and the families of the victims are disappointed and frustrated by the long delays. Some think the defense attorney is out of bounds. Some blame the D.A. All just want it to be over. “My frustrations are at an all-time high,” said Paul Wilson, who lost his wife, Christy, a manicurist at the salon for more than 15 years. “It’s a never-ending sadness,” said Rooney Daschbach, who lost his sister, Michele Daschbach Fast, the soccer mom of three who stopped in Salon Meritage for the first time that day. “I’m trying to figure out how there ever could be justice,” said Beth Webb, whose sister Laura Webb Elody worked and died there, and whose mom, Hattie Stretz, just popped in for a haircut and a little pampering when she was shot, though not fatally. The district attorney now finds himself fending off not just the usual critics – the defense attorneys – but also The New York Times editorial board, which labeled the D.A.’s explanations “implausible.” Some of the very people Rackauckas swore to help – the victims’ families – are losing faith as well. “We just are not able to ever put this aside, to get back to our day-to-day lives,” Wilson said. “And it continues to be there for one reason – the incompetence of Tony Rackauckas and his office, which has completely and utterly dissembled this very black-and-white case because of their mishandling of it.” Some families still support the district attorney and his efforts to seek the death penalty for Dekraai. “They’re great guys doing exactly what they need to be doing,” said Craig Burke, brother of Michelle Fournier, Dekraai’s ex-wife. “In hindsight, I wish they hadn’t used it (an informant). But they were trying to do the best case possible.” At least four family members have asked Rackauckas to drop the quest for the death penalty in favor of life in prison without the possibility of parole. “That’s the one thing he could do for us,” said Webb. “Stop the madness. Take the death penalty off the table and end all the appeals, all the court appearances. And let us get on without looking over our (shoulders) for the next 20 years in court.” Webb added, “My mom asked the D.A., with tears in her eyes, she said, ‘I’m 75. I want to live my life without this hanging over my head. I’m asking you, can you do this?’ (Rackauckas) said no. I asked him point-blank, ‘What if all the families agreed to this?’ He said to my face: ‘We will not take it off.’ ” Former Salon Meritage hairstylist Gordon Gallego survived the shooting in a back room and witnessed its aftermath. “The families have memories of their loved ones in the best times,” said Gallego, 45, of Long Beach, who now co-owns another salon in Seal Beach. “I can’t get beyond the worst memories – those last sights, sounds, smells, everything I had to deal with.” Gallego lost his two best friends, Buzzo and Webb Elody. For more than 20 years, the three worked together, hung out together, vacationed together. “It’s hard for me to move forward,” he said, his voice breaking. “It’s still a struggle to get up every morning,” There is another victim, too, who was nowhere near the salon that day: Dekraai and Fournier’s son Dominic, then 8, who lost both parents in that 100-second span of gunfire. His mother was murdered, and his father will never step out of prison. Dominic’s older sister, Chelsea Huff, took him in and said her brother was adjusting to his new life but was still a bike-riding, skateboarding, baseball-playing boy. Amid the lingering grief and the endless delays, there is also the poignant intertwining of lives that tragedy so often compels – and that hints at the possibility of healing. Doug Childers’ life changed that day, too. He had led the band of good Samaritans on the day of the shooting as they raced to the salon from a construction site across the street, hoping to help. Though he had known none of the victims in life, he felt the need to attend their funerals. At one of the services, the 47-year-old contractor met a former Salon Meritage stylist. Two years later, Childers and Tammy Hetzel married on the sand in Seal Beach. Survivor Hattie Stretz attended – it had been at her daughter Laura Webb Elody’s funeral that the newlyweds met. Childers’ new best friend, Rooney Daschbach of Sunset Beach – Michele Fast’s brother – stood in as best man. Many other people connected to Salon Meritage filled the guest list that day.

270,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/05/obama-gun-control-executive-action-background-checks-licenses-gun-shows-mental-health-funding,"President expands background checks for online sellers and gun shows and calls on Congress to expand funding for mental health treatment and gun research First published on Tue 5 Jan 2016 18.06 GMT A tear-stained Barack Obama marked his final year in office with a last-ditch call for US gun control on Tuesday as he outlined new rules that will close important background check loopholes but leave much of the political heavy lifting to his successor. In a much-anticipated speech that focused more on what still needed to be done than the limited set of executive actions announced in advance by the White House, the president painted gun reform as the last great civil rights challenge of his generation.  “In Dr King’s words, we need to feel the fierce urgency of now, because people are dying,” a visibly emotional Obama told an audience of mass shooting victims and relatives in the East Room. “Our inalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, those rights were stripped from college kids in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara and from high schoolers at Columbine, and from first-graders in Newtown,” he added, his voice shaking. “First-graders. And from every family who never imagined that their loved one would be taken from our lives by a bullet from a gun.” The president had been introduced by Mark Barden, the father of Daniel, one of the 20 young children killed at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown three years ago. As his speech rose to its climax, with tears rolling down his cheeks, Obama said: “Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad and, by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.” In a rhetorical twist designed to undermine arguments against reform, the president insisted his plan to force all buyers of guns to undergo background check was not a “plot to take your guns” but comparable to going through metal detectors to board a plane and merely “the price of living in a civilised society”. “I believe in the second amendment. It’s there written on the paper … No matter how much people try to twist my words … I taught constitutional law. I know a little bit about this. I get it.” As well as expanding background checks to clarify that online sellers and gun shows need to be licensed, Obama also called on Congress to authorise extra spending for mental health and enforcement agents as well as new research into technology that can prevent unauthorised use of weapons by children and thieves. “We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer,” he said. “If we can develop technology that you can’t unlock your phone unless you’ve got the right fingerprint, why can’t we do it for guns? If a child can’t open a bottle of Aspirin, we should make sure that they can’t pull the trigger on a gun.” Reaction has been split about the impact of closing the existing loopholes for background checks, with the National Rifle Association insisting it would make little difference but gun control campaigners declaring it a landmark step in keeping weapons out of the wrong hands. “We’ve created a system whereby dangerous people are allowed to play by a different set of rules … That doesn’t make sense,” Obama said. “Everybody should have to abide by the same rules.” But Obama largely skipped any detailed discussion of the measure and concentrated on a highly political effort to persuade moderate Republicans to join his wider efforts to end legislative deadlock. “The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now but they cannot hold America hostage,” he said. “Congress needs to act, but folks in this room will not rest until Congress does … We can’t wait.” Republican presidential candidates, who have universally pledged to overturn Obama’s executive orders if elected, reacted with swift outrage to the president’s announcement. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee issued one of the fiercest statements, saying: “In America we believe in the constitution, not confiscations, dictatorships or Kings, and Obama’s newest assault on the second amendment is a blatant, belligerent abuse of power.” Huckabee, who is currently lagging far behind the polls, added: “I will never bow down and surrender to Obama’s unconstitutional, radical, anti-gun agenda.” Even the relatively moderate Ohio governor John Kasich accused Obama of “poisoning the well” by using unilateral executive action. “You don’t just shove these things down their throat,” he said, though welcoming the mental health aspects of the reform package.“Barack Obama is obsessed with undermining the second amendment,” added Florida senator Marco Rubio. “He is looking for any way possible to undermine it. He has been doing this forever. Now this executive order is just one more way to make it harder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their families.” Earlier this week, New Jersey governor Chris Christie called Obama “a petulant child” for pushing gun control while former Florida governor Jeb Bush worried that the executive action would set a “quite dangerous” precedent. In contrast, Democrats praised Obama’s action. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton tweeted: “Thank you, @POTUS, for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next president has to build on that progress – not rip it away.” At the outset of his emotional speech, Obama acknowledged the presence of Gabby Giffords, the congresswoman who survived a gunshot wound to the head in 2011, as well as families of gun violence victims that he enlisted directly in his call for action. He told Barden, the Sandy Hook father who lost his son in December 2012: “I still remember the first time we met, the time we spent together and the conversation we had about Daniel, and that changed me that day, and my hope earnestly has been that it would change the country. “Five years ago this week a sitting member of Congress and 18 others were shot at at a supermarket in Tuscon, Arizona. It wasn’t the first time I’ve had to talk to the nation in response to a mass shooting, nor would it be the last. Fort Hood. Binghamton. Aurora. Oak Creek. Newtown. The Navy Yard. Santa Barbara. Charleston. San Bernardino. Too many.” Some members of the audience repeated the words: “Too many!” Much of the speech echoed similar heartfelt calls by the president in the wake of each of these mass shootings, but the White House is hoping that by staging one of its last big set-piece events before the start of the presidential election season next month, it can jolt the American public out of the political stalemate. Obama acknowledged: “It won’t happen during my presidency. But a lot of things don’t happen overnight. A woman’s right to vote didn’t happen overnight. The liberation of African Americans didn’t happen overnight. LGBT rights – that was decades’ worth of work. So just because it’s hard, that’s no excuse not to try.” He pleaded with advocates of gun control to be just as determined as influential pro-gun groups. “All of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby’s lies, all of us need to stand up and protect its citizens, all of us need to demand governors and legislators and businesses do their part to make our communities safer. We need the wide majority of responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time this happens and feel like your views are not being properly represented to join with us to demand something better. “And we need voters who want safer gun laws and who are disappointed in leaders who stand in their way to remember come election time. Some of this is just simple math. Yes, the gun lobby is loud and it is organised in defence of making it effortless for guns to be available for anybody any time. But you know what, the rest of us, we all have to be just as passionate, we have to be just as organised in defence of our kids. This is not that complicated.”",2016-01-05 16:39:38,Tearful Obama tightens gun control and tells inactive Congress: 'We can't wait',,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Early last year, the Media Research Center set up a new project to keep tabs on all stories on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts, categorizing each item by its topic and total airtime. Thanks to that effort, we can now precisely analyze the agenda and bias of the Big Three networks — what they covered, and what they failed to cover, in 2015.

The results show a network news agenda heavy on crime, terrorism and weather, but light on Democratic scandals, ObamaCare’s failings, the out-of-control national debt, sanctuary cities and Planned Parenthood’s grotesqueries. From January 1 through December 31, 2015, MRC analysts reviewed every weekday and weekend evening newscast that wasn’t pre-empted by sports in the Washington, D.C. area. In one year, the networks churned out 13,022 news items (including both full reports and anchor briefs) totaling more than 300 hours (18,549 minutes) of coverage.  The top five network news topics of 2015, followed by a review of stories the networks minimized or ignored last year:

■ Crime: By a wide margin, TV news put crime at the top of their 2015 news agenda, with reports about crime consuming one out of every six minutes (17 percent, or 52 hours) of broadcast evening news airtime last year.

	The crime story that most fascinated the networks last year: allegations of misconduct against police officers. Allegations against police officers consumed well over 13 hours of airtime (795 minutes) on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts in 2015, or more than one-fourth of all crime stories. In contrast, while incidents portraying the police in a bad light were highly promoted, those same networks offered just 109 minutes — less than one-seventh the airtime — to cases where police officers died in the line of duty, such as the 42 officers who were shot to death last year.

	The biggest individual crime stories were: the Charleston church shooting in June (3 hours, 8 minutes); the manhunt for the two escaped prisoners in upstate New York (2 hours, 58 minutes); the death in police custody of Baltimore’s Freddie Gray and the ensuing protests and riots (2 hours, 15 minutes); and the mass shooting at an Oregon college in early October (1 hour, 29 minutes).

	After the shootings in Charleston and Oregon (as well as after the ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California — see below), the networks emphasized liberal demands for more restrictions and regulations of gun ownership. In all, the networks spent 2 hours, 46 minutes covering the campaign for expanded gun control, or the equivalent of more than nine full newscasts.

■ Terrorism: The continued influence of ISIS in the Middle East, along with numerous ISIS-inspired terror attacks in the U.S. and Europe, propelled the issue of terrorism to second place on the network news agenda in 2015, as the evening newscasts gave the topic 39 hours of coverage, or 13 percent of all airtime.

	Nearly one-third of this coverage came in just the last few weeks of the year, as the networks produced 6 hours, 17 minutes of coverage after December’s ISIS-inspired attack in San Bernardino, and 5 hours, 22 minutes of the ISIS attacks in Paris, France.

	The networks devoted 2 hours, 50 minutes to the trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; 1 hour, 45 minutes to the attack on the headquarters of the French magazine Charlie Hebdo; and 1 hour, 15 minutes to the ISIS-inspired attack on two military centers in Chattanooga in June.

	On a related note, the evening newscasts spent 4 hours, 4 minutes on Europe’s refugee crisis, making it one of the top international stories of the year.

Despite the prevalence of terror news for 2015, the networks barely noticed the refusal of both President Obama and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton to label the enemy as “radical Islam.” The President’s controversial insistence on using alternative language garnered a mere five minutes of airtime on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts in 2015.

	Top presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made similar statements, including at a Democratic debate in November, but neither CBS nor NBC ever discussed her comments, let alone any critics. ABC gave  Clinton’s rejection of the phrase “radical Islam” a total of 32 seconds of airtime.

	In contrast, when Republican candidates failed to use media-approved terminology regarding Islam and the War on Terror, the network coverage was much more intense. For example, the networks cranked out more than 10 minutes of evening news coverage after GOP candidate Ben Carson said he wouldn’t want a Muslim president.  ■ Weather: Even the most casual news observer has likely noted that the evening newscasts have ramped up their coverage of weather in recent years, so it may be surprising that this topic accounted for only 11 percent of the networks’ 2015 news agenda, with 32 hours, 52 minutes of coverage.

	More than two hours of this coverage (133 minutes) was spent on the summer wildfires in several western states, while the related California drought received 67 minutes of coverage. The other top weather stories of 2015 included May’s extensive flooding in Texas (88 minutes); Hurricane Joaquin, which affected the Caribbean in late September and October (60 minutes); and the subsequent flooding in North and South Carolina later that month (58 minutes).

	As these dramatic weather stories unfolded, the networks often put them in the context of “climate change.” Talking about the flooding in Texas, NBC correspondent Miguel Almaguer fretted back on May 28: “In just three weeks, much of the state has gone from extreme drought to crippling flood....Scientists say climate change is exacerbating the wild swings.” Overall, the networks spent 97 minutes of airtime in 2015 opining about climate change, including 17 minutes for the much-ballyhooed climate summit in Paris in December.

■ Politics: Even with the dramatic 2016 presidential race, the networks pushed politics to fourth place on the 2015 news agenda, devoting 32 hours, 38 minutes to the topic (or 11 percent of all airtime). Not surprisingly, four-fifths of TV’s political news was spent on the presidential campaign, which garnered 26 hours, 22 minutes of airtime last year. In contrast, the networks spent only 42 minutes on the other big political drama of 2015, the resignation of House Speaker John Boehner and the race to succeed him.

	GOP candidate Donald Trump received the most news coverage (579 minutes), more than Democrat Hillary Clinton (486 minutes) and far more than any of his GOP rivals. Second to Trump among the Republicans: Jeb Bush, who garnered 150 minutes of airtime, followed by Ben Carson (102 minutes), Ted Cruz (64 minutes) and Marco Rubio (62 minutes).

	None of the other actual presidential candidates in either party accumulated an hour of evening news airtime, although the networks spent nearly two hours (111 minutes) speculating about whether or not Vice President Joe Biden would choose to run. He did not.

■ Accidents and Disasters: Rounding out the top five, the networks last year spent 10 percent of their evening news airtime (31 hours, 50 minutes) on accidents and non-weather related disasters last year, with much of that airtime spent covering a large number of smaller incidents, include car and truck accidents for which dramatic online video was available.

	The most-covered disaster of the year (2 hours, 12 minutes) was the crash in March of a German Lufthansa jet in the French Alps, the result of a suicidal co-pilot. Other highly-covered disasters for 2015 included April’s earthquake in Nepal which killed more than 8,000 people and sparked international relief efforts (1 hour, 48 minutes), which received slightly more coverage than May’s train derailment in Philadelphia which left eight dead and 200 injured (1 hour, 31 minutes). While it’s good to know what stories the networks are emphasizing, it’s just as important to pay attention to the stories that the media are minimizing or censoring altogether. Among the stories getting Rodney Dangerfield levels of respect from TV news in 2015:

■ Democratic Scandals: While about 30 percent of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s coverage (146 minutes) was devoted to the scandal surrounding her use of a private server to bypass the State Department’s system, the broadcast networks seemed far less interested in accusations of misconduct surrounding the Clinton Foundation.

	Author Peter Schweizer documented how the Clinton Foundation, or former President Bill Clinton personally, accepted large contributions from entities with business before the State Department while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. It’s at least the appearance of a whopping conflict of interest, but ABC, CBS and NBC offered just 27 minutes of coverage of this in 2015, most in the early part of the year, before interest in the presidential campaign heated up.

	The media seemed just as uninterested in Hillary Clinton’s role in the Benghazi attacks: her potential failure to provide adequate security prior to the attacks; the government’s failure to launch a rescue mission while the attacks were taking place; and the phony story pushed after the attacks that it was all the fault of a YouTube video that insulted Islam. For the year, the networks delivered just 46 minutes of Benghazi coverage, two-thirds of which (31 minutes) focused on Clinton’s testimony to the House committee in October.

	As for an Obama administration scandal that the networks seemed intent on ignoring, the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts failed to produce any coverage of the IRS scandal, even as the House committee investigating the matter introduced a resolution calling for the impeachment of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen for his alleged failure to comply with committee subpoenas and making false statements under oath.

	But while these Democratic scandals couldn’t rouse the networks attention, those same newscasts delivered 54 minutes of coverage of the rape and sexual assault charges made against Bill Cosby, and spent 2 hours, 7 minutes covering the “Deflate Gate” scandal surrounding New England Patriots’ quarterback Tom Brady.

■ ObamaCare: The news for ObamaCare was mostly negative in 2015. In October, the Department of Health and Human Services reduced the estimated enrollment in ObamaCare to 10 million by the end of 2016, or less than half the original estimates made in 2013. Both customers and taxpayers suffered when nine ObamaCare state co-ops failed in 2015, including those in New York, Colorado, Kentucky, and South Carolina.

	And in November, the biggest insurance company participating in ObamaCare, UnitedHealth, said it might have to withdraw from the program because of huge losses — $700 million — in the preceding year.

	But the broadcast networks that seemed so excited when ObamaCare first became law seemed uninterested in following up on its actual performance. ABC, CBS and NBC spent just 34 minutes covering the gargantuan government health program last year, and the lion’s share of that coverage (24 minutes) was devoted to the Supreme Court case about whether the program’s tax subsidies could go to citizens of states that did not set up their own exchanges.

	In that case, the Court ruled in the administration’s favor. “ObamaCare, 2; conservatives, zero,”  crowed ABC correspondent Terry Moran on June 25. ■ National Debt/Deficit: The national debt surged to $18.9 trillion in 2015, but none of the three broadcast networks seemed the slightest bit bothered. The monstrously-huge debt itself garnered less than three minutes of coverage, most from a CBS Evening News story that hypothesized that Donald Trump’s tax plan would “cost the Treasury $10 trillion over ten years, and increase the nation’s $18 trillion debt.”

	The networks spent even less airtime (99 seconds) talking about the annual budget deficit, although both CBS and NBC last January told viewers that President Obama was going to take credit for “shrinking deficits” in his 2015 State of the Union Address.

	The only other debt-related story to get even a small mention in 2015: 40 seconds talking about the vote about increasing the debt ceiling.

■ Sanctuary Cities: In spite of a seemingly endless debate about immigration reform, for nearly eight years the broadcast networks had remained silent about so-called “sanctuary cities” — liberal jurisdictions that don’t cooperate with the federal immigration authorities. A Nexis search reveals that, before this year, there had not been a single mention of “sanctuary cities” on the ABC, CBS or NBC evening news shows since 2007.  

	The black-out was briefly broken in July after a young woman was killed by an illegal immigrant who was set free by local San Francisco law enforcement instead of turned over to immigration officials for deportation. The crime triggered a national discussion, one enthusiastically joined by GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. Yet even with Trump railing against the “stupid politicians” who enact such policies, the broadcast networks tired of the issue after a mere eight minutes of coverage.

■ Planned Parenthood Videos: Perhaps the most outrageous story of 2015 was the scandal surrounding Planned Parenthood, revealed after the Center for Medical Progress released a series of undercover videos showing officials with the abortion provider negotiating over the sale of baby body parts. ABC’s World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News waited a full day before they even acknowledged the existence of these videos, while the NBC Nightly News waited three days, until July 17, to report on a video that was released on July 14.

	Over the next few months, a total of eight videos were released by the Center for Medical Progress, but the three evening newscasts devoted just 25 minutes to their release and the ensuing political debate. This was about the same amount of airtime that ABC, CBS and NBC spent covering Bruce Jenner’s transition to Caitlyn Jenner, and nowhere near as much time as they gave to the top cultural item on the media agenda last year, the legal and cultural debate over gay marriage (2 hours, 11 minutes).

273,http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/01/background_checks_for_michigan.html," Gallery: Silver Bullet Firearms Indoor Range and Training Center Michigan set a new record in December on background checks of firearm purchasers, as gun dealers around the state report a sharp spike in sales since the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., and subsequent debate about gun control. ""It's been said that Obama is the best kind of salesman (for guns) and that's pretty much the truth,"" said Brian Laskowsky at Moose Creek Archery Gun/Tackle in Lansing. Traditionally, his store is busiest during deer-hunting season, he said, but ""that's nothing compared to this."" ""This is a small shop,"" Laskowsky said. ""If I sell three guns a day, that's a decent day. But I've been selling seven to 10 a day."" Gun stores in Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Saginaw and Jackson contacted by MLive also reported significant increases in sales. Those anecdotal reports are supported by data from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NCIS, a division of the FBI that performs background checks on people purchasing guns. A total of 76,882 checks were performed for Michigan gun sales in December, easily the state's highest month since NCIS was launched in 1998 and almost double from December 2014. It is also 26 percent higher than January 2013, the previous Michigan record with 60,852 background checks, according to NCIS. Gun dealers say the 2013 spike was driven by the Sandy Hook mass shooting, which occurred Dec. 14, 2012. Michigan is part of a national trend, although it has seen larger increases. Nationwide, NCIS did 48 percent more background checks in December 2015 than December 2014. In Michigan, there was an 82 percent over the same time period. And the NCIS data doesn't reflect all gun sales, since background checks aren't required for private transactions. They also aren't required for those with a concealed pistol license since they already have had a background check and are monitored by the state. Don Thurston, a manager at Silver Bullet Firearms in suburban Grand Rapids, estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of those buying guns have a concealed pistol license. RELATED: 7% of Michigan adults have concealed license permit But he also said much of the current boom is from new gun owners. ""We're seeing a lot more customers who come in and say they've never purchased a gun in their life,"" Thurston said. ""But they want to be able to defend themselves, and are afraid they won't be able to get guns in the future."" Many of those customers are women, he said. ""They live alone, and maybe they heard about a break-in down the street,"" Thurston said. Other buyers are longtime gun owners adding to their collection or buying guns now as an investment, on the theory that if it becomes harder to get guns, their value will go up, Thurston said. ""Then there are others who are just upset with the whole political scene, and they're buying as much as can almost as a form of protest,"" Thurston said. He added that gun sales have been strong ever since Barack Obama was elected president in 2008. ""When he became president, we had unprecedented sales,"" Thurston said. ""Since then, any time there's talk in the media about gun control, sales go up -- every single time."" The current increase is particularly strong, he said. ""Our customer count is way up, and so are our sales,"" he said. ""Maybe close to double."" 'We sell freedom' It was hard to find a parking place Saturday at On Target, a suburban Kalamazoo store where a sign in the parking lot reads: ""We talk guns. We sell freedom."" ""It's been crazy busy, just nonstop"" in recent weeks, said Jeff Cramer, a co-owner of the store. ""This store is full every day, and I mean every day."" Like Thurston in Grand Rapids, Cramer said customers are worried their ability to buy a certain guns, or any gun, in the future might be constrained. ""People who were sitting on the fence are jumping off, and saying, 'I'd better do it now,'"" he said. Bob Niswander, who lives in southern Cass County, and two of his friends were among the customers at On Target on Saturday. ""Just looking around, to see a couple things,"" Niswander said. As a concealed pistol license instructor, he said he is pleased that more people are buying guns. ""I want to see more people owning guns, and learning how to use them safely and responsibly,"" he said. Sam Dickey, an Elkhart, Ind., resident with Niswander at On Target, nodded in agreement. ""Every first responder needs to have a gun,"" he said. ""And a first responder is any person who has a gun pointed at them. So everybody needs a gun."" Joe Burden, at Schubach's Sporting Goods in Jackson, said sales have skyrocketed ever since ""Obama began running his mouth."" Four days after the San Bernardino shooting, Obama gave a national televised address on gun control, and Burden said customers flocked to the store the next morning. ""We had people coming in and they didn't want to talk. They just pointed to an AR-15 and said, 'I want that,' "" Burden said. Gun sales haven't slowed since, he said. ""It's been about double, and it's still ramping up."" 'Extra busy' at gun show There were long lines Saturday morning to get into the Grand Rapids Gun and Knife Show, held in suburban Grand Rapids. Doug Carl, who organized the event and does a gun show almost every weekend somewhere in Michigan, said attendance at his most recent shows have been ""huge."" ""The news media drives our business,"" he said. ""National events dictate everything"" in gun sales. Hundreds of people milled around at the show, held at a vacant shopping mall. The majority were middle-aged and older white men, although some women and families also were taking in the show. Alhough not a political event, the political leanings of the crowd were clear. Multiple vendors displayed the Confederate flag. Ted Cruz supporters were signing up volunteers. A vendor selling T-shirts said his big seller of the day was one that read ""Hillary for PRISON 2016."" Other shirts in his collection: One that read ""Celebrating Diversity,"" picturing an array of guns; a sketch of a black machine gun with the caption, ""Don't Hate Me Because I'm Black""; one reading "".45 Because Shooting Twice Is Just Silly"" and another that read ""Yes, I'm the Armed American Christian Pork Eating Infidel They Warned You About,"" decorated with a cross, star and American flag. Around the corner from the T-shirts was Wil Holland of Grand Rapids, a private seller who could be affected by Obama's executive order, which seeks to crack down on sales at gun shows. As a hobby, Holland said, he goes to gun shows to sell, buy or trade his gun collection. Unlike a federally licensed firearms dealer, Holland doesn't have to conduct background checks on buyers. He falls under an exemption for someone ""who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of this personal collection of firearms."" Obama wants the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco to be more aggressive about pursuing gun sellers using the exemption to skirt the law. Holland said he is in the process of becoming a licensed dealer, but said Obama's executive order is a ""horrible idea."" He said Michigan law already forbids sale of handguns at gun shows without a background check unless the buyer has a concealed pistol license, which shows a background check already has been conducted. And in states such as Indiana, where handgun sales are allowed at gun shows without a background check, he says he occasionally refuses to go through a sale if the person ""looks shady."" ""I had one guy who had 'Thug Life' tattooed above his eyebrow,"" Holland said. ""I don't think he was an English teacher. You can tell."" On the other side of the gun show, Andy Madura was at a table recruiting new members for the National Rifle Association. He was busier than usual, he said, thanks to Obama. ""Everybody's concerned,"" he said. While Obama has said repeatedly that he wants ""common sense"" gun control and insists he is not trying to take people's guns, people such as Madura aren't buying it. ""When he says he doesn't want to take your guns, but than brings up Australia and Great Britain as examples to follow -- that's exactly what they did,"" Madura said. ""How can I think otherwise? I don't want that to happen here."" The politics A CNN poll released Friday found two-thirds of Americans support the changes announced by Obama, which would expand background checks to cover more gun purchases made online or at gun shows and make the NCIS background checks more efficient. No surprise, gun owners are among those in the vocal minority. Burden, the gun salesman in Jackson, is among those who chafe as what he characterizes as the ""anti-freedom, gun-hating, liberal agenda."" People have the right to defend themselves, he said, and ""they're starting to realize it can happen anytime, anywhere, from being robbed to being raped to being burglarized. It's not necessarily just fear of a mass shooting, but (in San Bernardino) you had one by a known enemy from a foreign country."" Taking away guns from good people ""is like castrating yourself because your neighbor has too many kids,"" he said. ""It doesn't make any sense. Any time tyranny has reigned, it's been under the guise of public safety."" But not all gun owners oppose tighter restrictions. ""I'm all for background checks,"" said Dave Walker of Hartford, who was a customer Saturday at On Target in Kalamazoo. ""You want to keep the crazies away from guns."" Still, Walker said, ""they already have a lot of laws they don't enforce."" Chris Watrous of Cedar Springs owns four guns and was among those browsing the merchandise at the Grand Rapids gun show. He said he wasn't too worked up about Obama's proposals, saying they would have less impact on gun owners or public safety than either side thinks. ""Personally,"" he said, ""I don't think it's that big of a deal."" Julie Mack is a reporter for MLive.com.

274,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-obama-gun-safety-20160105-story.html,"WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama went to the East Room of the White House on Tuesday prepared to announce modest new restrictions on gun sales across the country, but the moment quickly turned into one of the most emotional public episodes of his presidency. The 37-minute speech became part eulogy, part admission of political failure and part constitutional lecture on the Second Amendment. Eventually, the president cried. Flanked by more than a dozen men and women, many of whom he had consoled privately shortly after they lost loved ones to gun violence, Obama summoned the memory of nearly two dozen children killed three years ago in their Connecticut school. He decided on the new curbs unilaterally, he said, because guns have cut short too many American lives. ""Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,"" he said, wiping a tear from his right eye. ""And, by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day."" This time he flicked away a tear from his left cheek. The president was introduced by Mark Barden, whose son Daniel, 7, was slain in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. People in the audience held up photos of their dead loved ones as Obama began his remarks. In a speech that veered from somber to outraged, and was punctuated by moments of humor, the president said he was trying to bring the country together on a divisive issue at a time when he does not have to worry about the political fallout. ""I'm not on the ballot again. I'm not looking to score some points,"" he said, adding that he does not believe that the new standards violate the Constitution: ""We understand there are some constraints on our freedom in order to protect innocent people."" A key provision of the new initiative would require more gun sellers - especially those who do business on the Internet and at gun shows - to be licensed and therefore to conduct background checks on potential buyers. Another measure would mandate that firearms lost in transit between a manufacturer and a seller be reported to federal authorities, and more than 230 additional examiners and staff members would be hired to help the FBI process background checks 24 hours a day. The plan came under immediate attack from Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called it ""President Obama's Political Gun Control Announcement."" A slew of GOP presidential candidates derided Obama's actions and leveraged them in fundraising appeals. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush said that Obama ""has proved again why he will go down as one of the most liberal and divisive presidents in the history of our nation."" The campaign of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, which had already made images showing the president in body armor and a under tactical helmet, told potential donors in multiple appeals over the past few months, ""Obama wants your guns."" Obama said it will take congressional action to fully address the problem, but his actions Tuesday clearly fulfilled a pledge he made to ""politicize"" gun violence ahead of the 2016 elections. ""Our unalienable right to life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - those rights were stripped from college students in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara, and from high schoolers at Columbine, and from first-graders in Newtown,"" he said, pausing. ""First-graders."" Obama spoke in a room packed with Democratic politicians, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, and with gun-control advocates, including shooting victims and family members of those killed by gunfire. Former representative Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., shot at point-blank range during a mass shooting in 2011, entered with a cane, accompanied by her husband, Mark Kelly. Giffords shook hands with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and received a standing ovation as she took her seat in the front row, next to Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. The two held hands, with Giffords regularly squeezing Jarrett's, as Obama spoke. Actress Amy Schumer, a cousin of Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and a gun-control advocate, also sat in the front row, as did the two young daughters of the late Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in a mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, last year. Jarrett said the arrayed grief overwhelmed Obama, whose reputation for stoicism and aloofness is well-earned. ""He looked around the room and saw people who he had met over the last seven years on the worst days of their lives,"" Jarrett said later. Those losses, she said, coupled with inaction in Congress, make it ""just hard to fathom. That frustration spilled out today - that's what everybody saw."" With the background-check measure, the administration is clarifying what it means to be ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms. This does not constitute new regulation, which would have been subject to public comment and congressional review, but its application depends entirely on how aggressively federal authorities press the matter. Scott Hamblin, a firearms dealer with Guns Midwest, said in an email that there ""are licensed dealers and individuals and nothing in between, never has been. . . . It appears to me that the White House figured out today that they just wanted to enforce the current law and that explains the addition of new ATF agents."" The initiative comes after gun transactions hit a record high in 2015, with background checks for purchases and permits rising 10 percent over the previous year, to 23.1 million. Gun-safety activists said the measures could help interrupt trafficking of some illegal firearms and could embolden other politicians to enact more sweeping restrictions in the future. ""This is significant in the signal it sends, culturally,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. In the Washington suburbs, Montgomery County Police Chief Thomas Manger praised Obama's proposals as ""a great step in the right direction."" Manger, whose police force covers a Maryland county of 1 million people, also serves as president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. ""There are too many guns that are sold out of a trunk of a car to a person who would not be able to pass a background check, and that's how many guns get into the wrong hands,"" Manger said. ""The fact is we need universal background checks. And, again, this is a no-brainer."" Even with the reduced political consequences of not running for office again, Obama conceded the difficulty ahead. ""Yes, it will be hard, and it won't happen overnight,"" he said. ""It won't happen during this Congress. It won't happen during my presidency."" Some lawmakers have raised the idea of blocking the plan by halting funding for the FBI or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. But Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who opposes the president's executive actions, said that would be difficult, since lawmakers agreed on a budget deal last month that will keep the government running through September 2016. ""Once you give up the ability to let spending expire, you need 60 votes to defund something - and now, there aren't 60 votes to defund anything,"" said Paul, who is also a presidential candidate. ""If we had courage and guts, which most of the time we do have, we could vote on a new spending bill which blocks funding for new gun-control orders. That was why so many of us thought the omnibus was a bad idea."" The National Rifle Association and other gun rights advocates have pledged to fight the measures, even as they described the administration's push as minimal in scope. ""The American people do not need more emotional, condescending lectures that are completely devoid of facts,"" said Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. He added that the group's members are concerned about public safety, ""but the fact is that President Obama's proposals would not have prevented any of the horrific events he mentioned."" Obama said the point of his executive actions is ""not to debate the last mass shooting but to do something to try to prevent the next one."" As Jarret walked back to the Oval Office with the president after the speech, she carried handwritten notes from Mark Barden and his wife, Jackie, thanking Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for their efforts in trying to prevent a repeat of the violence that cost them their son. She slipped them into the president's inbox, so he could read them later.

The masked militant became one of the most infamous members of the terrorist group after appearing in a number of beheading videos. By
      
        David Mack Posted on January 19, 2016, at 5:10 p.m. ET Mohammed Emwazi, the notorious ISIS terrorist who earned the moniker ""Jihadi John"" after he appeared in a number of propaganda videos killing Western hostages, died last November in a drone strike in Syria, the terror group confirmed Tuesday. U.S. officials had said they were ""reasonably certain"" Emwazi, a Briton who grew up in London before traveling to Syria, had been killed in the Nov. 12 airstrike in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. The latest edition of the ISIS propaganda magazine Dabiq includes a eulogy for Emwazi, whom the group called Abu Muharib al-Muhajir. ""Abu Muharib finally achieved shahadah [martyrdom] for the cause of Allah, which he had sought for so long,"" his obituary read, ""as the car he was in was targeted in a strike by an unmanned drone in the city of al-Raqqah, destroying the car and killing him instantly."" Emwazi became infamous in August 2014 when he first appeared in a video showing the killing of James Foley, an American freelance reporter held captive by ISIS. In subsequent videos, he also beheaded American Steven Sotloff, Britons David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. None of these murders were referenced in the Dabiq article, however the piece did state Emwazi's ""harshness towards the kuffar [non-Muslim world] was manifested through deeds that enraged all the nations, religions, and factions of kufr [non-believers], the entire world bearing witness to this."" The article also includes a picture of the smiling face of a man said to be Emwazi, who wore a mask in his videos. The ISIS obituary also confirmed several elements of Emwazi's background that had been previously reported, including efforts by British intelligence officials to prevent him from leaving the U.K. by stopping him at airports for questioning. The latest issue of Dabiq also includes an article on December's mass shooting in San Bernardino, which was carried out by a husband and wife, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, who had posted messages on social media in support of ISIS. ""Syed Rizwan and his wife did not hold back from fulfilling their obligation despite having a daughter to care for,"" the article says over a photo of the child's empty crib.

And CNN’s Erin Burnett did nothing to press him on this outrageous claim during her on-camera interview with him Sunday. Now, the AR-15 wasn’t the rifle used in the Orlando attack, which left 49 people dead in the worst mass shooting in American history. It also was a likely terrorist attack, but let’s discuss these remarks by Grayson because it shows how the anti-gun Left has no clue what they’re talking about.   “You’re right about that. Thank you very much,” said Burnett. This AR must've been broken cause it definitely didn't shoot 700 BPM. pic.twitter.com/cKKgOowkkL Over at INJO, Joe Perticone aptly noted how a) the AR-15 rifle isn’t an assault rifle; b) AR isn’t short for “assault rifle""; and c) the AR-15 isn’t as powerful as a hunting rifle, though it can be chambered in over 30 calibers. Mostly, these rifles are chambered to fire .223/5.56 rounds.   That means that the user can toggle between at least two settings, semiautomatic and automatic. The AR-15 is a gas powered semiautomatic rifle, meaning one pull of the trigger corresponds to only one round being fired. In contrast, the M16 and sometimes the M4, which are the United States military’s small arms rifle of choice, do fire automatically. The M16 and M4 also allow a three-round burst option, which is also not possible on an AR-15. […] The AR-15 is not that powerful when compared to common hunting rifles. A .223 round is often too small to take down large game like deer and elk. In many cases, the .223 is prohibited for hunting certain game. Because of its lack of power, it might not fully kill the animal, leading to suffering. […] Another misconception is that the “AR” in AR-15 is an abbreviation for “assault rifle.” It is not. The “AR” is an abbreviation for “ArmaLite Rifle,” after the company that designed the firearm. The AR-15 isn’t new either. Its first iteration was seen in the late 1950s. In the video below, an automatic AR-15 (so, one that isn’t readily available for civilians, requires an ATF tax stamp for ownership, a lengthy background check, and your name and weapon added into federal database) is fired until the point of malfunction. The person in the video could get off 830 rounds before the barrel failed—and this is not even the rifle used in the attack. He warns that the heat from the barrel could set off rounds prematurely. The gas tube can be melted, pretty much this is one of the things you don’t want to do to your AR-15, which liberals don’t know because again—they have no clue what they’re talking about. It’s not the safest thing either.

And if he wins the nomination it could get worse, as he will have a different strategy that could possibly win him the White House. To be clear, Rand Paul once had a strategy that could win as well. It withered when many narratives changed within his party—and the nation. If liberals neutralize Trump’s “divide and conquer” approach, the changed narrative will cause his bid to wither as well. To begin with, liberals must be the glue that holds together the victims of Donald Trump’s attacks. They must embrace who they claim to be in words and in deeds. Absent that, Trump or one of his ilk could easily win. So far Donald Trump has alienated blacks, Latinos, immigrants, Muslims, liberals, women, and a few others. His method, however, has been strategic. He encourages attacks and disparagement between groups. He then takes action to invite some members of the disparaged group into the fold (e.g., meeting with black ministers, addressing a Latino conference, etc.). Trump attacks Muslims in a manner that makes everyone feel suspect of Muslims. He attacks the Black Lives Matter movement by pairing its activism with false crime data. He attacks Latino immigrants by painting them as more violent than the population at large. His off-the-cuff remarks about women are simply attempts to diminish their status to create the subliminal message that women cannot or should not be president. So far liberals have done a good job of either helping his strategy along, or they treated him as a joke. They do so at their own peril, and at the peril of the country. When Black Lives Matter came to Netroots Nation 2015, a conference considered a bastion of liberal thought and activism, the disgust exhibited by many liberals created a fracture that will not easily be healed. BLM activists realized that all liberals weren’t on board with what—for them—is an existential fight. The terrorist attacks in Paris and the subsequent attack in San Bernardino, California, along with Trump’s Muslim-hating narrative have left many Muslims wondering where their friends are. Many polls indicate that many Americans, including liberals, have bought into the fallacy of the overbearing Muslim threat. A murder committed by one undocumented Latino immigrant was allowed to be taken out of context. Donald Trump seized on it, and the traditional media allowed it to be a strike against all undocumented Latino immigrants. Of course liberals should know much better. They should be the ones with the intellectual and moral prowess to mitigate Trump and his ilk. So far, some are failing and others are simply assuming that the goodness of most Americans will inoculate us from a Trump presidency—or the presidency of one of the others in the GOP clown car. But the stark reality is very different. Too many in the Black Lives Matter movement feel they are fighting a battle alone. To be clear, they have no fear of doing so, as many in the movement believe liberals and the black civil rights movement have failed. They believe that when Martin Luther King Jr. turned the other cheek, it was a sign of weakness. After all, if your rights and freedoms are given to you as opposed to being won through fighting, strength, and absolute resolve, they can easily be taken away. Why? Because the arbiter of said freedoms may feel there are no consequences for taking them away (as with voting rights, police brutality, credit abuse, and more). Because of a lack of allies within the political party, these outsiders may forego the elections altogether. The same applies to Muslims. They see that the vast majority of violent crimes and terrorist attacks are committed by white men. They see excuses being made for these perpetrators in an attempt to segregate those bad deeds from Muslim bad deeds. That misreporting affects the population at large. The national narrative gives the impression there is a Muslim problem that we must fight over there, while we keep those over here in check. Why aren’t we exposing the right-wing militias throughout the country? Does anyone recall any real analysis of what happened in the mass shooting with the biker gangs in Waco? Meanwhile, undocumented immigrants are a net positive to American society. They are the ones that allow otherwise lower middle-class to middle-class folks to have a semblance of a good life through their dependable service and generally inexpensive and affordable labor. They fill a niche very few want to talk about or are ever honest about. They also are loved by corporations because in certain specific areas, they negatively affect wages for American citizens. Many pay Social Security taxes they will never get back in Social Security payments. Most (if not all of them) pay regressive taxes (sales taxes, fees, etc.) as well as income taxes. Their overall crime rates are lower. Here is the reality: Liberals must decide that they won’t be taken in by the Trump narrative. It can be rather appealing to some Democrats and liberals alike, if they let their guard down. If liberals become the glue that shows the humanity and commonality between all of the targets of Trump’s vitriol and appeal to those misled by the right, a 2016 presidential win is possible. There is one more caveat: The Democratic Party must allow a real debate of ideas between the Democratic candidates, and everyone must have an opportunity to see these candidates. They must debate often in order to generate the necessary excitement, and the one with the best message must emerge. A coronation will not do. A coronation leaves those without crowns with the same feelings that Black Lives Matter activists, Muslims, Latinos, and others might be grappling with: Why support a party that has failed me? Why even vote?",2016-01-04 07:00:00,"As Trump attacks and divides, liberals must be the glue that unites the victims of his vile vitriol",,115,http://www.dailykos.com

Every Monday New technologies – and a new commitment from Congress to fund them – are making a reliable exit system for visa holders viable. January 22, 2016 In Washington, it's been a rare week of progress on what has been one of Congress’s more protracted issues: setting up an exit system to track the departure of people leaving the country. For the first time, the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday released a report on how many people entering the United States overstay their visas. Congress has been requesting such data, repeatedly, over the past 20 years. At the same time, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) deployed a biometric pilot program at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York to test facial recognition on some returning US citizens – it's a bid to make such data more reliable. But that move may raise privacy concerns for some. Lessons learned from this experiment “will inform the use of facial biometric matching during departure,” DHS officials told a Senate oversight hearing on Wednesday. This rush to show progress is, in part, the result of arm-twisting by a frustrated Congress. In December, Congress gave DHS 30 days to produce the report or lose $13 million in funding for the DHS secretary’s office, effective immediately. But it also signals a change in how quickly new technologies – and a new commitment from Congress to fund them – are making a reliable exit system viable. At this point, people coming in to the US with visas are checked upon entry, law enforcement checks are run, and ""if applicable,"" biometrics such as fingerprints and photo are collected and matched with other DHS databases to identify those who pose a national security threat. But there's nothing in place, proponents say, for when they leave. Having a biometric exit system would give law enforcement a more accurate sense of who overstays their visas and which ones might represent security concerns. Such a system is an important start to identify weaknesses in the visa system, says Thomas Kean, former chair of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, known as the 9/11 commission, which led calls for a biometric entry-exit system. ""The problem is not just how we're going to check them out when they leave, but how do we find out where they are if they don't leave."" Last month, Congress directed another $1 billion exclusively to a biometric exit system by increasing fees to be collected from those who apply for H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant work visas. When Congress first mandated entry-exit tracking, in a rewrite of US immigration law in 1990, the available entry-exit data was biographic, or name-based, and generally viewed as incomplete and unreliable. But after the 9/11 attacks, pressure for a biometric system intensified, especially after the disclosure that four of the 9/11 hijackers had overstayed their visas while planning the attack. “A number of terrorists came in here on visas and just stayed and nobody knew it because we have, to this day, no way to check when they came in,” Mr. Kean says. The 9/11 commission recommended that DHS, “properly supported by the Congress, should complete, as quickly as possible, a biometric entry-exit screening system.” Kean says that in all his appearances before Congress, he never saw an objection. In 2004, the CBP set up such a system at ports of entry, but the exit piece was never implemented. “The main reason we haven’t seen a biometric exit system implemented is because neither the Bush administration or the Obama administration wanted to do it,” says Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington. “They were afraid that it would slow down the boarding of flights and be too expensive to implement, but the cost has come down significantly,” she adds. In this week’s report, DHS said that nearly 500,000 of those who came to the US on tourist or business visas stayed on after their visas expired. “In other words, as of January 4, 2016, DHS has been able to confirm the departures of more than 99 percent of nonimmigrant visitors scheduled to depart in FY 2015 via air and sea POEs [ports of entry] and that number continues to grow,” the report concludes. That remaining 1 percent is as alarming to critics of US immigration policy on the right, as the “top 1 percent” is to critics of US income inequality on the left. “While the administration boasted that the overstays represented about 1 percent of nonimmigrant visitors who were supposed to leave the US in FY 2015, there were thousands of overstays from countries associated with Islamic terrorism – including 210 from Afghanistan, 681 from Iraq, 564 from Iran, 1,435 from Pakistan, 440 from Syria, and 219 from Yemen,” reports Breitbart News. Nor does the report hazard an estimate of how many people in the country illegally overall have overstayed their visas. “Since an estimated 40-50 percent of unlawfully present foreign citizens (or 4.5-6 million) entered the United States legally and failed to leave the country when required, it is clear that operating on good faith is not the best way to ensure the integrity of our immigration system,” writes Roy Beck in an op-ed in The Hill. Other current events are raising the profile on creating a reliable exit system. The mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last month renewed concerns about the US visa program – especially its inability to track those who come in legally but fail to leave. The issue is also playing out in the presidential election. In addition to calling for a US-Mexico wall – for which he plans to have Mexico foot the bill – GOP front-runner Donald Trump has called for criminal penalties for those who overstay a visa and “completion of a visa tracking system – required by law but blocked by lobbyists.” Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R) of Alabama, who chaired Wednesday’s Senate panel, noted that there were more visa overstays last year than the population of any city in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina. Asked (rhetorically) by Sen. Charles Schumer (D) of New York why he had chosen those three states to mention, Senator Sessions replied: “Because there are three elections coming up.... And perhaps when people go to their election they’re going to consider these type of issues.” Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

Saturday, 02 January 2016 03:54 PM President Barack Obama said he’ll meet on Monday with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to discuss what executive actions he can take to restrain gun violence, focusing White House attention on the contentious issue in his last year in office. The plan quickly drew the attention of Donald Trump, front- runner for the 2016 Republican nomination, who said there were already enough ""rules and regulations"" governing the firearms industry. Enacting new gun rules, which the administration promised in December, is part of “my New Year’s resolution to move forward on our unfinished business as much as I can,” Obama said is his weekly video and radio address, released on Friday. The president singled out gun control as a priority, saying federal efforts to limit violence had been stifled by a gun lobby that wields more power in Congress than public opinion warrants.  “Tens of thousands of our fellow Americans have been mowed down by gun violence,” Obama said. “And yet Congress still hasn’t done anything to prevent what happened to them from happening to other families.” No major gun-control measure has emerged from Washington since a 1994 assault weapons ban, which expired ten years later and wasn't renewed. Obama unsuccessfully tried for congressional passage of new gun-control laws after the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 young children and six adult staff members were killed. ""We know that we can’t stop every act of violence. But what if we tried to stop even one?"" said Obama. A Senate vote in December to strengthen background checks on gun-buyers, voted on the day after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, killed 14 people, failed largely along party lines. Nearly all Democrats supported the measures while Republicans, who hold the majority, were mostly opposed. ""It's not the gun that pulls the trigger,"" Trump said in an interview taped for CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" broadcast that will air on Sunday. ""I don't like it. I don't like what he's doing."" ""We have plenty of rules and regulations, there's plenty of things they can do, right now, that are already there, they don't do them,"" Trump said, according to a transcript provided by the network. The three major 2016 Democratic candidates for president have called for tougher gun control in the wake of the San Bernardino attack, carried out by a married couple who were followers of radical Islam. That includes Senator Bernie Sanders. The Vermont independent,who has been criticized by rivals Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley for not being tough enough on guns in the past, was one of the 48 senators who voted in favor of West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin's amendment to expand background checks. © Copyright 2021 Bloomberg News.

284,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/kFIKYSrNAtU/,"Actress Alyssa Milano already knows she’ll be casting her vote for Bernie Sanders in this year’s presidential race — because the other 2016 candidates make her “sick to her stomach.”  “I really just am disgusted by where we are right now in the political system,” the Charmed and Who’s the Boss star told HuffPost Live this week. “I think we pin everyone against each other and it’s just creating this really hostile planet and world, and it’s upsetting to me. It’s upsetting that I’m raising kids in this time.” Milano said that she’s “always been politically active,” but thinking about the current crop of 2016 contenders, apart from Sanders, makes her physically ill. “I just can’t with any of these candidates,” she told the Huffington Post. “I can’t even — it makes me sick to my stomach, all of it. But Bernie I feel like is a really honest, cool dude. He doesn’t seem like a politician. He doesn’t seem too polished, too rehearsed. I think his intentions are really pure, and I think we need someone with pure intention.” With her endorsement of Sanders who has been representing his state in DC since 1991, Milano joins a list of more than 100 other “artists and cultural leaders” who have pledged their support for the Vermont senator’s campaign, including Will Ferrell, Danny DeVito, Sarah Silverman, Jeremy Piven, David Crosby, Bonnie Raitt, and members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Milano has indeed been politically active over the past few years. The actress was an early celebrity supporter of Obamacare when computer glitches threatened to derail the online insurance marketplaces, and also voiced her support for gun control following the mass shooting at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College in October. The actress has also previously weighed in with her opinion on Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. “Trump really does have an amazing resting bitch face,” she tweeted on the night of CNN’s Republican presidential debate in September.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. MILWAUKEE – The mother of a man accused of planning a mass shooting at a Masonic temple in Milwaukee says her son was set up by the FBI. Khawla Hamzeh says that despite a criminal complaint describing Samy Mohamed Hamzeh as a Muslim extremist, her 23-year-old son is immature, not very religious and was just trying to convince his friends he was tough. Samy Mohamed Hamzeh is charged with unlawfully possessing a machine gun and receiving and possessing improperly registered firearms. His mother told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (http://bit.ly/1TpM66E ) that she wonders why the FBI watched Hamzeh for months without arresting him, and then sold him guns. Wisconsin's top federal defender says Hamzeh's defense will likely focus on the accuracy of undercover recordings that were made in Arabic and translated into English.

298,http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/20/fbi-official-perfect-storm-imperiling-gun-background-checks.html," CLARKSBURG, W.Va. — The surge of criminal background checks  required of new gun purchasers has been so unrelenting in recent  months that the FBI had been forced to temporarily halt the  processing of thousands of appeals from prospective buyers whose  firearm purchase attempts have been denied. Since October, the bureau's entire cadre of appeal  examiners— about 70 analysts — was redeployed here to  help keep pace with waves of incoming background investigations  that continued through December when a record 3.3 million firearm  sales were processed. The transfer of examiners, which had left a backlog of 7,100  appeals, is only part of a makeshift reorganization that FBI  Assistant Director Stephen Morris said has become necessary to  handle a burgeoning workload that expands in the wake of every  mass shooting and call for increased gun control that invariably  prompt firearms sales binges across the country. ""The last several months, we've kind of found ourselves in a  perfect storm,'' Morris said in an interview with USA TODAY. In  each of the last six months, the number of background checks has  risen steadily, according to FBI records, ending with December's  record with more than a half-million over the previous monthly  high posted in the aftermath of the 2012 Newtown, Conn., school  massacre. Since before Thanksgiving weekend, all annual leave for the more  than 400 employees of the bureau's National Instant Criminal  Background Check System has been canceled. That Black Friday, the  system was swamped with 185,345 background check requests on new  firearm sales, a new single-day record.  Morris said  temporary background check examiners also are being pulled from  internal construction projects and bureau divisions that oversee  the gathering of crime statistics across the nation.

The best country in the worldPalin: Trump has guts to fight GOP establishmentHow to land the cheapest flights of 2016 The near-constant frenzy of activity within the FBI's sprawling  complex, four hours away from the nation's capital, may represent  the most compelling argument in favor of at least part of  President Obama's recent executive actions aimed at reducing gun  violence: the addition of 230 examiners to the NICS operation and  200 more agents for nation's chief gun enforcement agency, the  Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms. The new positions are desperately needed, authorities said, to  support the seriously stressed NICS system and to prepare for an  even heavier workload as a consequence of the central provision  of the administration's executive actions. That directive would  require an increasing number of private firearms dealers to be  licensed, subjecting their customers to scrutiny under the  federal background check system. Some of the administration's most vocal opponents on gun policy,  including those who offered initial skepticism or outright  opposition when the executive actions were unveiled earlier this  month, now appear open to potentially adding the hundreds of  requested positions that would require congressional  approval. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, acknowledged in  a written statement to USA TODAY that more NICS examiners ""might  be necessary.'' Even the National Rifle Association, which assailed the  administration's overall gun plan as ""political exploitation,''  said that they would ""have no objection'' to proposals that would  both bolster the ranks of the ATF and the NICS system. The group, however, remained critical of the plan's call for  private gun sellers to obtain federal licenses so that buyers  would go through background checks. ""If the addition of these agents are used to apprehend criminals  — not to harass law-abiding gun owners — and (the  examiners are used) to improve the broken NICS system, we would  have no objection,'' NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told USA  TODAY. 'Delay queue is growing' Burrowed in the rolling hills of the West Virginia countryside,  the idyllic setting for the NICS operation masks the fraught,  politically charged debate that has engulfed national gun  policy. The NICS system, mandated by Congress as part of the Brady  Handgun Violence Prevention Act, has for nearly 20 years been a  centerpiece of the government's effort to block criminals from  obtaining firearms. Yet the operation has largely struggled to  keep pace with a steadily increasing number of firearm transfers,  while maintaining databases of criminal and mental health records  that rely solely on voluntary contributions from state and local  authorities. Those records are crucial to determining whether  prospective gun buyers are eligible to purchase firearms. ""We live off those records,'' Morris said. ""That is our bread and  butter. ...The misnomer is that FBI has everything that exists on  criminal history records in some big repository, and that's  simply not true. A lot of data sits out in state and local  systems. Being able to reach out and get that information can be  very, very challenging.'' Morris said it is impossible to estimate how many records could  be missing from the system. ""You don't know what you don't know, right?'' Earlier this month, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in letters to  the nation's governors as part of the administration's executive  actions, urged states to provide additional information, saying  the existing NICS databases were ""far from complete.'' The  letters also contained subtle warnings that the FBI intended to  publish each state's contribution in the coming months. ""The NICS is a critical tool in keeping firearms out of the hands  of prohibited persons,'' Lynch wrote, ""but it is only as  effective as the information entered into the databases upon  which it relies.'' While slightly more than 70% of firearms transactions are allowed  to proceed within minutes after buyers appear at the counters of  licensed dealers, according to the FBI, the records are  especially key to quickly reconciling the remaining transfers  that require deeper reviews of state and local data before  decisions can be issued on whether guns can be sold. Depending on the volume of gun sales, at any one time the queue  of pending cases — which by law must be resolved within  three business days — generally ranges in the several  thousand. Recently, those numbers have ballooned as high as  13,000. If the cases, some of which depend on local law  enforcement agencies finding paper records to satisfy an  examiner's search, cannot be resolved within the three-day  period, gun dealers are generally free to complete the sales. ""Some (cases) aren't being looked at until the third day,''  Morris said, referring to the increasing volume and limited  staffing. ""That delay queue has grown ... that meter is running.'' Morris said that he would like to limit examiners' caseloads to  two reviews per hour to ensure accuracy. But that number has  nearly doubled to nearly four cases per hour. Roof serves as cautionary tale The enormous stakes are not always apparent, until the first  reports of a new mass shooting echo across social media or cable  television. No one recent case underscores the sobering nature of the work  here more, officials said, more than an April transaction in  South Carolina, reviewed by a veteran examiner at the West  Virginia facility. In that case, which could not be resolved within the three-day  period, Dylann Roof was mistakenly allowed to walk away with the  .45-caliber handgun allegedly used two months later to kill nine  people during an evening Bible study session at the iconic  Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston. During the background check, Roof's March arrest on felony  drug charges was mistakenly attributed to the Lexington  County, S.C., Sheriff's Department, not theColumbia, S.C., Police  Department, which actually made the arrest. The sheriff's  department operates the jail where Roof had been detained. The Columbia police report included information that Roof  admitted to drug possession, which would have triggered an  immediate denial by NICS, according to bureau guidelines. But  that information was never seen by the reviewer because the FBI's  database did not include Columbia police contacts in its list of  agency contacts for Lexington County purchase reviews. The  reviewer did attempt to reach the Lexington County prosecutor's  office, which was handling the drug case at the time, but  received no response. ""We are all sick about what happened,'' FBI Director James  Comey said during a July briefing when the error was  disclosed. Morris said the Roof case continually ""humanizes the process,''  which mostly churns on far outside the public spotlight. ""These are people who are making life-and-death decisions,''  Morris said, adding that analyst in the Roof case remains on  the job working new cases every day. Given the information  available at the time, authorities have said the examiner did  everything possible to appropriately vet the purchase. ""She's a great examiner, too. I'd love to have 230 more of  them.'' Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

          / CBS News President Obama's announced executive actions on guns are considered a moderate victory for those in favor tightening gun laws, but some of his proposals could still face several legal and legislative hurdles. The centerpiece of Obama's plan targets the so-called ""gun-show loophole"" by clarifying who is ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms. This means that people who claimed to be hobbyists and were therefore not conducting background checks, might need to do so now for interested buyers, and the administration is reiterating that prosecutors can go after those people. Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the UCLA Law School, said the administration's actions are ""on solid legal ground"" because they merely clarify existing law and restate what courts have already said about gun sales: gun dealers not defined by the number of firearms they sell, but rather by other factors that might signal they are running a business rather than engaging in a hobby -- for instance, how often they sell, whether they have business cards and whether they sell new or old guns. ""It's also designed to make it difficult to challenge because it was really issued as guidance to prosecutors rather than a formal new rule setting out who can sell guns and who can't,"" Winkler told CBS News. But given the politically charged nature of the issue, there are still sure to be people who try to challenge the move as a violation of their Second Amendment rights, he said. Chuck James, a former chief deputy attorney general in Virginia who now works in the firearms practice at at Williams Mullen, said, for example, an individual could argue that undergoing a background check is an unconstitutional burden on the right to buy arms. A person who wanted to sell a large inherited gun collection could object to having to obtain a license as a gun dealer. Or an auction house that is selling a firearm as part of an estate sale might say it is not in the business of selling firearms. While the administration is unilaterally attempting to close the gun-show loophole, other parts of the plan will require congressional approval, which could create serious obstacles. To better enforce existing gun laws, the president will ask Congress to approve funding for 200 additional agents for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). And to expand treatment and background check reporting for people with mental health issues, the plan calls for $500 million to increase access to mental healthcare. These funding requests will likely be submitted to Congress in the next few months, but lawmakers may not consider them until at least the end of September, which is when current government funding expires. And House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, has already fired a warning shot implying Congress has no interest in cooperating. ""No matter what President Obama says, his word does not trump the Second Amendment,"" Ryan said in a statement Tuesday. ""We will conduct vigilant oversight. His executive order will no doubt be challenged in the courts. Ultimately, everything the president has done can be overturned by a Republican president, which is another reason we must win in November."" On Monday, before the White House even unveiled the measures, Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch warning her that he intends to use the power of the purse as an appropriator ""to protect our Second Amendment rights."" Even given the initial backlash from congressional Republicans, lawmakers may not necessarily be opposed to approving the requested funds. After all, the latest government funding package contained a $42 million increase this year to the ATF. ""They will kick and scream to say these things are terrible. But at the end of the day, are they going to do anything to stop it? Probably not,"" predicted Tim Daly, director of campaigns, guns and crime at the Center for American Progress. The funding request for expanding mental health treatment, for example, could be difficult for Republicans to oppose after they've consistently pointed to mental health after almost every mass shooting. ""For those in Congress who so often rush to blame mental illness for mass shootings as a way of avoiding action on guns, here's your chance to support these efforts. Put your money where your mouth is,"" Mr. Obama said in a speech from the White House Tuesday. Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pennsylvania, who has authored a mental health reform bill that Speaker Ryan has backed, appeared to pour cold water on the mental health segment of the plan on Tuesday. ""There is a big difference between funding 'mental health programs' and enacting reforms addressing serious mental illness,"" he said. ""More money into our disastrously failed and antiquated system will only result in more lives lost."" Besides the funding requests, the overwhelming criticism from Republicans could motivate them to look at alternative legislative action. They could pass a stand-alone law attempting to nullify the actions, though the president wouldn't sign that. If anything, when Congress considers the next round of government funding later this fall, Daly says Republicans could use the process to stop the plan. ""I think their best vehicle, if they are in fact serious about wanting to prevent the administration from enforcing the laws on the books, would be to do that through appropriations riders,"" he said. At the same time, Daly said because Mr. Obama is only trying to strengthen the enforcement of current laws, he said Republicans might not have much wiggle room to target the plan's background checks centerpiece. As Speaker Ryan suggested, Republicans could launch a legal challenge, which has already been done to protest the president's immigration actions from 2014. Winkler and James identified other areas of the administration's plan that could pose thorny legal issues as it is implemented. One, Winkler said, is a rule that the Social Security Agency will write to ensure that the records it has on the approximately 75,000 people each year who have a documented mental health issue are transferred into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). ""Depending on what that rule looks like it could be problematic,"" he said, although the rulemaking process could take at least a year. There's also a new ATF rule that will clarify gun dealers will be responsible for notifying law enforcement when a gun is lost or stolen in transit. Previously, the regulations were ambiguous about where that responsibility lies. ""That's going to put an increased burden on manufacturers who have already relinquished custody or control to a third-party carrier,"" James told CBS News. ""That's going to ripple through the firearms manufacturing community as they grapple with how to deal with that."" The Supreme Court has never weighed in on most of these issues, but Winkler said that in general courts have been fairly permissive about gun regulations. Federal courts ""have been clear that most forms of gun control are constitutionally permissible so long as you are not preventing law abiding people who are of an appropriate age to buy a firearm,"" he said.

300,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/23/gun-rights-groups-launch-offensive-against-obamas-executive-gun-control/,"On January 23, The Hill claimed the NRA “stokes fears” with its new ad tying President Obama and Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton to gun confiscation. The NRA wants the public to understand that Obama’s unilateral actions on gun laws “are just a first step toward more radical gun control.” And it points to pro-confiscation remarks from Obama and Clinton to make its point. According to The Hill, a new NRA video says the “Obama administration plans to implement an ‘Australian-style’ gun confiscation that would force law-abiding Americans, including hunters, to turn in their firearms.” The video shows Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton “calling Australia’s gun buyback program a ‘good example’ that is ‘worth considering.’” The video then shows Obama laughing off “such worries during a recent CNN town hall on guns.”  Far from simply stoking fears, the NRA ad points to statements Obama and Clinton actually made. For example, Obama responded to the October 1 Umpqua Community College shooting by saying, “We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours–Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it.” During a town hall at Keene State College on October 16, Clinton said the Australian government’s approach to confiscating guns via a mandatory buyback “would be worth considering … on the national level.” She went on to reaffirm this statement, saying the Australian gun ban is “worth looking at” in the U.S. On January 8, the day after CNN’s gun control town hall, the Associated Press reported that Obama mocked Americans who fear confiscation by describing it as “imaginary fiction.” Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

303,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/8lxA9fzX-kA/,"Congressman Ted Yoho introduced a Resolution of Condemnation and Censure against President Obama today. The resolution states that “President Barack Obama has failed to fulfill his duty in article II, section 2 of the Constitution of the United States, that he has failed to ensure a strong national defense, has failed to fulfill his duty in article II, section 3 of the Constitution of the United States, and that his foreign policy has led to increased global instability.” The resolution adds that the House of Representatives “hereby censure and condemn President Barack Obama for having willfully disregarded the President’s constitutional responsibilities as Commander in Chief of the United States through his continued failed lack of foreign affairs strategy, failure to follow the advice of military and intelligence advisors, and failed national security policy.” A full copy of the letter can be found here. Yoho told Breitbart News exclusively that President Obama’s foreign policies have been a disaster for every single country in the world. He added that the only country that is better off under the Obama administration is Iran. “The one thing he can’t tout is his accomplishments in foreign affairs and our national security,” Yoho told Breitbart News. “He has been a disaster in that,” Yoho added. “The world is less safe. Americans are less safe. We’ve got terrorists on our soil here and it’s because of his failure, whether you look at it in Afghanistan or Iraq policies with announcing troop withdrawals.” Yoho told Breitbart News that Obama’s foreign policy in Iraq and Afghanistan have “allowed the Taliban to move in and incidentally the Taliban controls more land mass today than they ever have.” He added that this has “led to the creation of ISIS.” Yoho also said that Obama’s strategy in Syria has “allowed Assad to kill or slaughter over 300,000 of his own people. That has led to the largest mass exodus since WW2.” The Congressman lists the following events as just a few of President Obama’s foreign policy failures: 2009 – U.S. Army Major Nidal Hasan took 13 lives and injured more than 30 others in the worst attack on an American military base. Obama’s DOD classifies the attack as workplace violence.
2012 – Islamic militants kill Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans in attacks on U.S. diplomatic compounds in Benghazi, Libya.  Obama’s U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, Secretary of State Clinton, and Press Secretary J. Carney blame a YouTube video
2013 – Boston Marathon bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev kill four – including Officer Collier and 8-year-old Martin Richard – and injure over 250.  Obama’s Administration ignores advance intelligence on the radicalization of Dzhokhar.
2015 – Mohamman Abdulazeez opens fire on Chattanooga, TN, military facility killing four Marines. Obama calls it a mass shooting and calls for stricter gun control.
2015 – San Bernardino shooters Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik kill 14 and injure 22. Obama calls for stricter gun control.
2016 – Philadelphia, PA, self-proclaimed jihadist, Edward Archer ambushes Officer Hartnett “in the name of Islam.” Obama’s Press Secretary Josh Earnest calls for stricter gun laws.

Republican candidates face off for first debate of 2016 on FBN; Reaction on 'Outnumbered' Programming Alert:Tune in to the FOX Business Network's GOP Debate on Thursday, January 14, beginning at 6 P.M. ET The good people of Charleston, South Carolina, divide themselves into two groups – SOBS (folks living south of Broad Street) and SNOBS (those on the northern side). Worse things have been said of the current crop of presidential hopefuls, nearly all of whom invade the Holy City the next few days – Thursday’s GOP debate, sponsored by the Fox Business Network; Sunday’s Democratic debate, carried by NBC. If you’re counting at home, this marks the sixth time the GOP field has gathered on one stage, the second time that the Fox Business Network (FBN) has done the honors and, with only seven candidates in the main event (watch live at 9 pm ET), it could be the first time an evening with the Republicans might not descend into pouting, posturing and crosstalk. How best to anticipate this debate? As in real estate: “location, location, location.” The debate’s venue, the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center, is less than 10 miles from the Emanuel AME church, the scene of last June’s mass shooting. Gun control won’t go undiscussed, what with President Obama bringing it up in Tuesday’s State of the Union Address and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley revisiting the incident in her Republican response. It’s a short walk from Emanuel AME to the Cooper River and a bustling container-ship and car-carrier operation that’s converted Charleston from a Navy town to a thriving hub of maritime commerce (BMW and Volvo use the seaport to ship autos made elsewhere in the right-to-work state). There’s no better tie-in for a few questions about the global economy. Those ships dock upriver from Fort Sumter and were the site of a louder anti-Washington protest than anything the Tea Party’s imagined. Will Donald Trump tell America it’s time to party like it’s 1861? What else to expect from the Republicans? In the Low Country spirit of sippin’ bourbon and whiskey concoctions, six things: 1.   Rebel Yell. Before we get into what divides the Republican field, here’s what unites it – multiple opportunities to yell President Obama post-State of the Union. Expect strong words on the President’s omission of the situation on Farsi island, his post-San Bernardino emphasis on guns and not domestic terrorism, his invoking the word “Muslim” only in conjunction with hate crimes, plus his insistence that America’s global influence isn’t in decline. 2. Canadian Club. The knock against Ted Cruz is that most folks who’ve worked with him don’t like him. Let’s see if that carries over onto the debate stage should Trump resume the questions about Cruz’s Canadian birth. Will any other candidate intervene, or will they let Cruz and Trump slug it out? Then there’s also the matter of the Goldman Sachs undisclosed million dollar loan… As for Cruz, does he laugh off these lines of attack, or continue to return fire as he’s just begun to do in New Hampshire? 3. Southern Comfort. To the adage about South Carolina’s quirkiness (“too small for a republic and too large for an insane asylum,” said the anti-secessionist James L. Petrigu), there’s this reality: it’s the most conservative of the four stops on the February primary circuit. How many of the seven contenders will cater to the local electorate, versus those who play to the more moderate Yankees up in New Hampshire? For the latter, keep an eye on Chris Christie, John Kasich and this guy . . . 4. Johnny Walker. That’s “Johnny”, as in John Ellis “Jeb” Bush, and “Walker” as in Walker’s Point, the family’s summer compound where the family assembles to celebrate wins and lick wounds. Historically, South Carolina has been invaluable to Bush presidential causes – both father and brother used it as a “firewall” in their respective winning candidacies. But that’s not so with Jeb. The Palmetto State doesn’t fit into a strategy that’s finish strong in New Hampshire or bust. 5. Wild Turkey. Not to suggest that Trump is poultry, but as usual he’s the wild card in the two hours he has to bond with the six other Republicans who trail him in national surveys. Do we assume Trump is the aggressor, in attacking Cruz? Or does he go easy on Cruz and go back to his favorite pincushion: the Clintons? 6. Old Fashioned. Not a brand of booze, but a cocktail (bourbon, splash of soda, bitters, sugar, orange wheel, cherry). The “old fashioned” candidate in this debate? It might be the decidedly youthful Marco Rubio, who suddenly seems less the futuristic GenXer and more a traditional Republican (convening a constitutional convention, berating Hillary Clinton for wanting higher taxes and bigger government). The last guy to popularize this cocktail: “Mad Men’s” Don Draper, who knew a thing or two about marketing and salesmanship. That show lasted eight years on television – the same goal as everyone mixing it up in North Charleston. Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.

305,http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/01/aussie-shopkeeper-uses-improvised-flamethrower-on-robbers/,"President Obama sure likes to cite Australia’s strict gun laws. Remember when he said this, back in June 2014? “Couple of decades ago, Australia had a mass shooting, similar to Columbine or Newtown. And Australia just said, well, that’s it, we’re not doing, we’re not seeing that again, and basically imposed very severe, tough gun laws, and they haven’t had a mass shooting since.” Sounds like paradise. Get rid of the guns and you get rid of the gun crimes. Whew! How’s your firearms-free utopia workin’ out for ya, Australia? 9News, Brisbane: A quick-thinking store owner in Redland City has launched a surprise attack against two armed robbers with the help of an improvised flamethrower. CCTV video shows the moment Alexandra Hills shop owner Dan Rigney defended himself against two armed thugs using insect spray and a lighter.  Fortunately, dangerous shopkeeper Dan Rigney didn’t have a gun or somebody could’ve gotten hurt. I still don’t like it, though. Why is Rigney allowed to have bug spray and a lighter? Look at what he almost did to those two innocent bystanders with his unprovoked attack. It’s fitting that they decided to retaliate by helping themselves to his money, but he never should’ve been able to throw flame at them in the first place. It’s time for Australia to ban anything that can be used to make an improvised flamethrower. Bug repellant? Bzzt. Oven cleaner? Clean it out. Hairspray? Cut. And cigarette lighters? Why does the average citizen need a cigarette lighter? Ban it. For that matter, they should ban fire altogether. Do you have any idea how many people die in fires every year? How many kids? I don’t know the exact numbers, but I’m sure it’s a lot. Use your heads, people: Fewer fires = fewer deaths from fire. Nobody should have the means to make a fire, for any reason, ever.

          / CBS News By this time next year, President Obama's successor will have been elected, but before he goes, he still has things he intends to finish in the remaining 12 months of his presidency. ""We think the lame duck moniker is dead,"" a senior administration official told CBS News. Another official told CBS that the president has instructed his senior staff to ""squeeze every last drop of progress out of the final year."" The president will fight to preserve gains in areas including ""access to affordable health care, expanding the green economy, implementing the Iran deal"" and continuing the normalization of relations with Cuba,"" the official said. Here's where he may make some progress: With some of Congress' most liberal and conservative members working together reform the nation's sentencing laws, criminal justice reform stands a decent chance at becoming law. In October, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation that would make some nonviolent drug offenders eligible for reduced sentences and give judges more discretion in sentencing. A similar, but less ambitious bill is making its way through the House. At his year-end news conference, the president told reporters he's ""optimistic"" the legislation can make a difference if the two chambers can merge their bills into a law he can sign. The measure, he argues, will save money and reduce recidivism, while making sure that people who make a mistake by committing nonviolent crimes still pay a price and serve their time. Mr. Obama broke with many members of his own party this year when he asked Congress for authority to fast-track a massive Asia-Pacific free trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). He had allies among the GOP, and their votes helped him secure  Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which will help speed the trade deal through Congress. The president could sign the deal with the other nations that are participating as soon as Feb. 4. Then, an economic review will be submitted to Congress, where the relevant committees, followed by the full House and Senate, will consider the deal. Mr. Obama has called the agreement ""the most pro-labor, pro-environment, progressive trade deal in history, that eliminates just about every tariff on American manufacturing goods."" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, helped usher TPA through Congress and has argued that the U.S. should be writing the rules on trade agreements. But he hasn't said if or when Congress will vote on the agreement. ""TPP has great potential,"" Ryan told the Wall Street Journal CEO Council in October, ""but we want to scrub this trade agreement to make sure that it reaches and meets the standards that we call for in TPA."" Even with Republican help, the president will face opposition from Democrats. All three Democratic presidential candidates oppose the trade deal, as does Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts. After months of legal review, the White House is expected to unveil executive measures aimed at reducing gun violence, as soon as early next week. The president himself announced that the review period is now coming to an end. ""A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence. And on Monday, I'll meet with our Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options,"" he said, in his weekly radio address, released on New Year's day. In early October, after the mass shooting at an Oregon community college, President Obama assigned White House and Justice Department lawyers to comb the law in search of any unused administrative authority available to him, given congressional inaction on guns. One proposal under consideration: separate the gun collectors from the gun sellers. Under current law, background checks are required for anyone buying a firearm from someone ""engaged in the business"" of selling guns (like a federally-permitted gun store or dealer). Sales made out of a person's private collection, many of which are done online, are not subject to background checks. The president could order a threshold be established such that anyone selling a certain number of guns annually would no longer qualify as a collector, but as someone ""in the business"" of firearm sales. Those buyers would then be subject to background checks. Closing Gitmo is a pledge that dates back to Mr. Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. But congressional opposition remains, and some of the president's former advisers are urging him to use his executive authority to transfer prisoners to the U.S. for detention or trial. Currently, 107 prisoners remain at Guantanamo. First, the president said he's going to take one last shot at presenting a plan to Congress to close it. But he admits that ""it's fair to say that there's going to be significant resistance from some quarters."" He's making a financial argument that ""it doesn't make sense for us to be spending an extra $100 million, $200 million, $300 million, $500 million, a billion dollars, to have a secure setting for 50, 60, 70 people."" Beyond the cost, the president has long argued that the prison fuels the propaganda of terror groups. Two of his former aides have argued that Article II of the Constitution gives the president exclusive authority to decide where U.S. military detainees are held. But other scholars argue that since Congress has explicitly banned Mr. Obama from transferring detainees to the U.S., any executive action to do so would be unconstitutional. Mr. Obama says he thinks a Democrat will succeed him. ""And I will campaign very hard to make that happen -- for a whole variety of reasons -- because they're far more likely to share my fundamental vision about where America should go."" Campaigning would be a departure from the 2014 midterms. Wary of President Obama's low approval ratings heading into the midterm elections, the White House limited his exposure on the campaign trail. Mr. Obama stuck to the blue states where he was more likely to help rather than hurt. Still, five of the nine candidates he campaigned with leading up to Election Day lost their races. This time, the White House isn't holding back. ""I do think the president will be active on the campaign trail. The president has expressed confidence that a Democrat will succeed him in office. But he's not naive to know that that's gonna take a lot of work,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told CBS' Chip Reid. ""I would definitely expect the president to be out there campaigning."" Asked whether the president is popular enough to be out on the campaign trail, Schultz said, ""I sure think so.""

308,http://dailycaller.com/2016/01/05/four-incidents-that-should-have-stopped-donald-trump-in-2015-but-didnt/,"GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump‘s campaign released its first television ad Monday, Jan. 4. The video – entitled “Great Again” – repeats a line from one of Trump’s previously released radio ads, promising that, as president, he will “cut the head off ISIS and take their oil.” Take a look: The ad prompted Quartz‘s Tim Fernholz to wonder if Trump’s switch to a more traditional political move – actually paying for air time, as opposed to enjoying free nonstop media coverage – might indicate the mogul’s fear that he’ll lose his presidential bid. But we all know that Trump is anything but a traditional politician. And just by looking at how he’s fared after political blunders, it’s obvious that “The Donald” is simply anteing up on his ever-surging popularity with this television ad. Here’s a look at four incidents that should have stopped Trump in 2015, but didn’t. In fact, they made him stronger… Trump’s Comments on Sen. John McCain: Early in Donald Trump’s campaign, the outspoken billionaire appeared at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, on July 18 and announced that former presidential hopeful and Arizona Sen. John McCain was “not a war hero” because he was captured. “I like people who weren’t captured,” Trump said. The remarks were immediately met with angry shouts and boos from the crowd. That same day, William A. Jacobson, a blogger for Legal Insurrection, wondered if perhaps Trump’s bombastic commentary might have “strangled his campaign” before it even started. However, a little over a week after his remarks, on July 26, Trump was backed by 18% of Republicans in a national CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, edging out ex-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who was at 15% at the time, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who had 10%. Trump’s Reaction to the Oregon Massacre: Three days after a student killed nine people inside a classroom at Umpqua Community College in southwestern Oregon, Donald Trump said he believed the answer to mass shootings like these was as simple as arming teachers. “This is in light of what’s gone on in Oregon,” Trump said to a crowd in Franklin, Tenn., on Oct. 4. “I’ll tell you, if you had a couple of the teachers or someone with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a lot better off,” he proclaimed. Trump received a lot of media criticism for his remarks, most notably from The Washington Post‘s Chris Cilizza, who compiled a video response entitled “Running for President? Here’s What NOT to Say After a Mass Shooting.” Pundits and critics called the billionaire businessman’s reaction “heartless” and “jaw-dropping.” On Oct. 5, notable left-wing media site Salon even said that the real estate mogul seemed dismissive when it came to the need for any further regulations on gun ownership. This is when Trump’s campaign experienced a slight decline in polls. According to Real Clear Policy‘s polling average on Oct. 4, Trump lead nationally with 22.8% – down from 30.5% in mid-September – over fellow GOP presidential rival and retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson. Carson was in second at the time with 17.3%. But The Donald’s “slump” didn’t last long – even though another incident was just days away… Trump Insults Iowa Voters en Masse: On Oct. 22, Donald Trump retweeted an insult to Iowa voters, just hours after a Quinnipiac University poll of the state’s Republicans revealed that Carson had knocked him from his perch in the state. Carson had 28% of registered Iowa Republicans’ votes at the time; Trump had 20%. Trump later apologized (sort of) for his offensive retweet, which was removed from his feed hours after it was initially posted. He did so by issuing another tweet, stating, “the young intern who accidentally did a retweet apologizes.” Jennifer Rubin, who writes for the Right Turn blog for The Washington Post and offers her self-ascribed reported opinion from a conservative perspective, responded to Trump’s insults by saying, “Trump supporters and even some in the mainstream media have begun asserting that it is possible to see Trump as the nominee. Now, we would argue, it is easier to see him getting out.” Unfortunately (for Rubin, that is), The Donald quickly regained his popularity in Iowa with 25% of the likely Iowa Republican caucus supporting him a month later. Another Quinnipiac poll released on Nov. 24 showed the billionaire in first place, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with 23% and Dr. Carson with 18%. Trump’s Proposal to Ban All Muslims: On Dec. 7, Trump made what was arguably his most controversial statement yet. The Republican presidential front-runner announced in a press release that he would like a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” This included tourists planning to visit the United States as well as Muslim-American citizens now abroad. It prompted very strong criticism. The Philadelphia Daily News cover the next morning labeled Trump “The New Furor.” And the mogul’s GOP rivals also had some harsh words for him. Regardless of this swift and fiery backlash, Trump continued to surge in the polls – in fact, he reached his highest point of the year. Trump’s support was nearly triple that of his nearest rival, Sen. Cruz, who scored 14% in a Monmouth University poll released on Dec. 14. Trump had an astounding 41% support.

309,http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/01/05/gun-stocks-surge-as-obama-issues-executive-orders-on-gun-safety/,"President Obama embraces Mark Barden prior to his speech on reducing gun violence. (Credit: MANDEL... [+] NGAN/AFP/Getty Images) Shortly before noon on Tuesday, Mark Barden stepped to a lectern in the East Room of the White House to introduce President Obama, who would go on to announce a series of executive orders aimed at curbing gun violence in the U.S. Barden wasn't just any warm-up act: he was the father of a boy named Daniel, an auburn-haired first grader with a gap-toothed smile who was killed in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012. ""In the three years since those 26 precious lives were lost at that school, far too many more lives have been lost to gun tragedies in this country,"" he said. ""As a nation, we have to do better."" Yet as Barden and then Obama spoke, gun stocks -- like Smith & Wesson and 
 
Sturm, Ruger
 & Co -- surged to fresh heights. This jarring dichotomy is part of a well-documented trend: whenever there's a mass shooting, whenever there appears to be an imminent tightening of gun laws, gun and ammo sales spike as consumers rush to buy what they believe will soon be harder to obtain. This, in turn, often has a buoying effect to gun-and-ammo company stocks. Though the aftermath of Sandy Hook proved to be an outlier to this trend (gun sales surged but gun investors got spooked and went on a selling spree), the aftermath of other mass casualty events have fallen into a neat pattern. Post-Aurora? Gun stocks jump. Post-Paris? Weapons stocks jump. And post-San Bernardino? Gun stocks jump. So in the wake of President Obama's efforts to strengthen existing gun laws, guns and ammo stocks are once again jumping. Shares of Sturm, Ruger & Co jumped 6.8% in Tuesday trading, hitting their highest level in a full year. The 164-year-old Smith & Wesson, meanwhile, saw its stock surge more than 12% and reach its highest price since July of 2007. Tied to Smith & Wesson's spike is the fact that the company announced on Monday that it will record higher-than-expected third quarter and full-year per-share-profit and net sales. Third quarter profit, the gun maker said, is now expected to come in somewhere between 39 and 41 cents per share, up from prior forecasts of 27 to 29 cents per share. Third quarter net sales are now projected to arrive somewhere between $175,000 and $180,000, up from previous guidance of $150,000 to $155,000. On a full-year basis, Smith & Wesson is now projecting earnings of $1.36 to $1.41 per share, up from prior calls for earnings between $1.26 and $1.31 per share. The full-year net sales forecast, meanwhile, has been bumped up to a range of $650,000 to $660,000 from a range of $625,000 to $635,000. The company will close its third quarter on January 31 and its full 2016 fiscal year on April 30. It's worth noting that despite the fresh highs for Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger, the stock spikes appear fairly concentrated in pure-play gun companies; retailers that sell guns as part of a larger cadre of products are not benefiting in quite the same fashion. Compared to Smith & Wesson's double-digit jump, the gun-friendly Wal-Mart only finished up 2.4%; Dick's Sporting Goods, 2.3%; and Cabela's, 1.4%. Also worth noting is that even before the executive orders were issued on Tuesday, the numbers were moving in gun manufacturers' favor: according to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), there were more than 23 million background checks initiated in 2015. This figure -- the highest ever since the FBI began tracking firearm background checks in November of 1998 -- is only a proxy for overall gun sales, but it certainly gives a good sense of America's gun appetite. This means that in a year in which there were 330 mass shootings and increased calls for broader gun control measures, more people than ever before initiated one of the pre-requisites necessary to a firearm purchase. As a result, Tuesday's surges are a part of a broader bull trend for Smith & Wesson and Ruger: Smith & Wesson gained a whopping 133% in 2015 trading, while Sturm, Ruger saw the value of its shares surge 70% during calendar-year 2015. And with an impending Town Hall on gun violence and a president who seems determined to incite some sort of change before he leaves office, continued gun stock gains seem likely. ""In Dr. King’s words, we need to feel the 'fierce urgency of now,'"" Obama said Tuesday. ""Because people are dying.  And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do, no longer suffice.""

310,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/-Np1SPO4hNM/,"Breitbart contributor AWR Hawkins, the nation’s leading journalist on gun rights, told a standing-room-only audience at the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention “Democrats use emotion, denial, and shame to get you to move against the second amendment [the right to keep and bear arms].” “Gun rights are God-given,” both “unalienable” and “absolute” Hawkins told the crowd. “Democrats attempt to defeat these God-given rights through three appeals: emotion, denials that any right is ‘absolute,’ and calls to actions,” Hawkins said. “These appeals to action,” Hawkins added, “are to do something just for the sake of doing it.” “Joe Dugan [founder and executive producer of the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention] asked me to explain what the Democrats are doing and what we can do [to fight back],” Hawkins, who has a Phd. in military history from Texas Tech, told the crowd. Hawkins began by referencing the Declaration of Independence. “I think about these words. Thomas Jefferson wrote them:” We hold these truths to be self evident. That all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. “Let me make some points. A lot of people like to grab the idea that all men were created equal, and they seize on the word ‘equal.’ … All men are created,” Hawkins told the crowd. (emphasis added) “It’s very important, the thing about all men being created…that tells me there must be a creator,” he added. “As I keep reading, what does Jefferson say? ‘They are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.’… Our unalienable rights come from God, not government. That’s Jefferson’s point,” Hawkins asserted. “Unalienable rights are also what are called natural rights because they come to us through the vehicle of natural law. Or ‘absolute rights.’ [19th century English legal expert] William Blackstone referred to them as absolute because He that gives them—God—is absolute,” Hawkins noted. “The federal government, unlike us, was not created by God… The federal government is a construct created to keep a check on evil men and the only powers it has are the powers delegated to it, the powers that men willingly give it for a time,” he said. “There is something particularly important about the second amendment,” Hawkins noted. “ It stands out somehow from among all the others.” “There is no logical argument against it.” “I spoke last week with Rep. Steven Palazzo, Mississippi fourth district, and he said, ‘Listen, if the 2nd amendment falls, all our rights fall.’ That captures what I’m talking about,” Hawkins added. “It is that amendment, the second amendment, of which Madison wrote ‘necessary to the security of a free state.’ Didn’t write it about the third or fourth amendment..didn’t write it about the first amendment,” he noted. “Because there are no logical argument to overturn these things, what the Democrats do is, and we move now from philosophy to practicality, they try to use emotion, denial, and shame to get you to move against the second amendment, and even if possible, to erase it,” he said. Hawkins noted that when the president held a press conference earlier this month to announce more gun control executive actions “there was a tear coming Obama’s cheek.” “We are expected to be touched by that moment,” Hawkins explained, noting that it was a transparent appeal to emotion. “Here’s the danger with emotion. Not only is it not logical, it draws us away from logic,” Hawkins noted. “Nothing the president proposed would even hinder a mass shooting, much less stop it.” Hawkins noted that former Democratic Congressman Gabby Giffords, seriously injured when she was among several shot by a Jared Loughner in Tucson, Arizona three years ago, plays an important role in this emotional appeal. “I’m glad she’s well,” Hawkins said of Gifford.”They bring out Gabby Giffords for an emotional pull,” he added. “Here’s their dirty little secret,” Hawkins told the crowd. “Her gunman passed a background check, Jared Loughner went through a background check before he got his gun,” he noted. “Then comes denial… Denial is the most sickening,” Hawkins said of the Democrats second tactic. “Here’s a problem. All unalienable rights are absolute. . .God gave us these rights, not government. Obama treads on that and he treads on you and me when he pushes that.” “Perhaps the left’s biggest success is what they’ve done to our educational system,” Hawkins noted. “Words like absolute rights, natural rights, they’re gone,” he added. Hawkins then turned his attention to one particular Democratic legislator.
“Sen. Chris Murphy, on August 13, I covered him saying this:” The 2nd amendment is not an absolute right. Not a God given right. It has always had conditions on it “What he’s basically saying here is Thomas Jefferson is wrong,” Hawkins noted. “If the Democrats can ever convince you that your rights are not rooted in God, in my opinion, it might be 3 to 4 years [more]that you might be able to enjoy your gun rights, then your gun rights are gone,” Hawkins said. “As soon as governmentt can say ‘we gave you those rights,’ they’re gone,” Hawkins asserted. “We have to dig in with Jefferson,” he advised the crowd. “Last point. When emotion and denial fail, the Democrats turn to shame.” “A common Democrat speech is ‘How many more have to die? When will congress finally act?’ “ “They want those congressman who represent pro-gun district to be ashamed [of following] a document that was created in the 1780s.” “Here’a a problem,” Hawkins pointed out. “Universal background checks, ‘we gotta have them,’ they say. California has universal background checks. There is no ‘gun show sales loophole’ in California. They also have registration,” he said of California’s current gun laws. “On December 2 they had two people [in San Bernardino, California] with guns kill 14 people.” “They [these two killers] passed background checks for their hand guns and they had a friend pass a background check for their rifle.” “When they tell you background checks will keep you safe, they lie,” Hawkins said of Democrats. “In the last 15 years, name one mass shooter who didn’t pass a background check.” “There were three,” Hawkins noted, and stricter background check laws would not have stopped them. “Adam Lanza in Connecticut stole his gun. The Clackamas mall shooter in Oregon stole his gun,” he noted. Hawkins then pointed to what the Democrats have done in California as a blue print for what they want to do to the entire nation. “If we ever give in to universal background check, let’s go to California right now. California git background checks.” “What followed? Registration.” “What followed? Confiscation.” “A judge can rule your guns can be confiscated [without you even being in the court room].” “California, that’s the blue print for what they’re pursuing at the national level.” “When you think about the second amendment, think of a wagon wheel,” Hawkins said. “This spoke is freedom speech, this spoke protects freedom religion, this spoke protects freedom of assembly….All of these spokes are held in place by a hub. I could cut a couple of those spokes and the wheel still turns,” he noted. “The hub is the second amendment of the Bill of Rights. Our senators, our congressmen, they need to guard that hub,” Hawkins told the audience. “Once they allow that hub to go away, that wheel collapses. All the other rights go away,” Hawkins said. “That’s not how free people live,” Hawkins concluded, as the audience rose in a standing ovation. 2nd AmendmentPoliticsAdam LanzaAWR HawkinsBarack ObamaGabby Giffordsgun controlJames Madisonjared loughnerSecond AmendementSenator Chris MurphySouth Carolina Tea Party Coalition ConventionThomas Jefferson .

311,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/peter-bergen-united-states-of-jihad-investigating-america-homegrown-terrorism-isis/,"Watch CBSN Live By Rebecca Lee February 2, 2016 / 1:42 PM
          / CBS News Following the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, the threat of homegrown terrorism and plans to defeat ISIS have taken center stage at the presidential race. Some candidates have promised aggressive measures, such as Sen. Ted Cruz who vowed to ""carpet-bomb ISIS,"" and Donald Trump, who proposed temporarily banning all Muslims from entering the country. But while the rhetoric may resonate with voters because ""they seem to provide answers,"" neither are viable solutions, according to CNN's national security analyst Peter Bergen. ""Ted Cruz wants to drop the bomb on ISIS but ISIS is embedded in the civilian population. Banning all Muslims - most of the people carrying out these attacks are American residents, American citizens, so that doesn't really solve the problem either,"" Bergen told ""CBS This Morning"" Tuesday. So far, there have been more than 300 arrests of people involved in some kind of jihadist crime, of which an alarming number - four out of five - were American citizens and residents. In his new book, ""United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists,"" Bergen offers a comprehensive look at ""homegrown"" Islamist terrorism, including a portrait of American jihadists based on 330 militants studied since 9/11. At an average age of 29, one-third are married and have kids, 12 percent have served time in prison and 10 percent have mental health issues. ""They're as educated as the average American, similar incomes - these are ordinary Americans. American Muslims are well integrated into American society in a way that's not true in places like Paris or London,"" Bergen said. Bergen said he also tried to answer the ""puzzle"" to determine the root of radicalization and point in which an individual decides to carry out a terrorist attack - but said he found ""no common denominators."" ""Some people have personal disappointments, or object to American foreign policy. Some people are Islamic, very radicalized - each person is a little different..."" Bergen said, then added that it could also be a ""cocktail"" of several factors. According to Bergen, resolving this ""puzzle"" is also a challenge for the FBI in their efforts to counter terror plots and detect homegrown terrorists, but he assured their defenses are ""very good."" Before the 9/11 attacks, just 16 people suspected of ties to terrorism were deemed on the no-fly list. That number has now jumped to 47,000. In 2015, there were also 900 active investigations across all 50 states and 56 were arrested. Still, according to a recent CBS News/New York Times Poll, 63 percent of Americans are very concerned about terror attacks committed by people currently in the United States, and 59 percent are concerned about terrorists entering the country. ""You're 5,000 times more likely to be killed by a fellow American with a gun than you are to be killed by a jihadi terrorist in this country. Yet we're more afraid about terrorism than we should be,"" Bergen said. ""The government of both the Bush and Obama administration has done a very good job of containing this threat. It will be persistent, it's not going to go away, but it is managed and contained."" But some plots slip through the cracks, like the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino by American citizen Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, a Pakistani immigrant. Bergen explained that while authorities ""should've known more"" about warning signs, the fact that the attackers were a married couple - which eliminated the need for separate meetings to plot the attack - and appeared to be ""regular, outstanding members of society"" with kids and a good job - made it difficult to foil. Bergen also commented on the controversy surrounding President Obama's refusal to link ISIS with Islam. President Obama has taken heat from critics for taking pains to separate Islam from terrorism. Former President George W. Bush walked the same line following the 9/11 attacks. Drawing comparisons to the Christian crusades, Bergen said, ""It's an uncomfortable fact that this has something to do with Islam. I mean you can't just wish that away... Of course it's a cherry-picked version of Islam but it is something to do with Islam."" First published on February 2, 2016 / 1:42 PM © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Adam Housley reports from Los Angeles WASHINGTON – A homemade bomb left behind by the husband and wife who perpetrated a mass shooting at a California social services center failed to detonate because it was poorly constructed, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. The failure compelled Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 29, to drive around the area of San Bernardino, California, after the shootings that killed 14 people. They were apparently trying to set off the remote-controlled bomb, one of the officials said. The officials were briefed on the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the case publicly. Investigators believe the couple intended to detonate the improvised explosive device — placed in a bag left at the center that morning by Farook before the shooting — to kill emergency responders or possibly before their attack. The plan to set off an explosive device as part of a wave of attacks is similar to an aborted 2012 plan by Farook and his longtime friend Enrique Marquez, who has been charged for his role in aiding the violence. The pair planned to explode pipe bombs on a freeway and then shoot emergency responders. The device found at the scene in San Bernardino consisted of three pipe bombs, constructed with Christmas tree lights and attached to a remote-control toy car switched to ""on."" The couple had the remote with them in their rented SUV. It was found after the shootout. The FBI is still trying to determine where the couple was or what they did during 18 minutes between the Dec. 2 attack and a shootout with authorities that left them dead. Investigators have no details on the couple's whereabouts between 12:59 p.m. and 1:17 p.m. that day and worry that they may have met with someone, dropped by a storage unit or visited a residence. Authorities accounted for the couple's movements using traffic and surveillance cameras, witness accounts and other techniques. While driving around San Bernardino and Redlands afterward, the couple appeared to drive aimlessly and stopped multiple times over a roughly 20-mile area, according to the FBI. They never strayed far from the location of their initial attack, and at one point appeared to be trying to drive closer. Farook and Malik also stopped by a nearby lake, which a dive team searched unsuccessfully for days, trying to find any abandoned electronic devices. Detectives watching the area saw the couple driving toward their home in the SUV, and Farook and Malik died in a shootout with authorities. One of the officials said the hard drive has still not been found, and the two cellphones, which were sent to the FBI lab, were so badly crushed that investigators have not yet been able to conduct a forensic examination on them. One rifle used in the attack was modified in what appears to be an effort to make the gun fully automatic. But despite the installation of the required parts, the machining wasn't done properly and so the effort was unsuccessful, one official said. The errors constructing the explosive device and modifying the gun may indicate that the two killers were self-taught, but without potential electronic evidence on the couple's computer hard drive and phones, it is hard to know for sure, officials said. The FBI has said there's no evidence that the attack was directed from overseas.

319,http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/06/obama-trump-and-thinking-like-a-trader.html,"The 2016 presidential election primaries haven't even started, but the last few weeks of political posturing and hyperbole are more like the kind of activity we see in the days just before election day in a race that's too close to call. Even for political junkies and experts, this early election season has often been hard to follow, predict, and understand. This is especially true when it comes to the way some of the candidates and the President himself have been acting lately. But here's a tool everyone, especially CNBC fans, can use to make things easier to understand: think like a trader. We know that active investors make bets, sometimes risky bets. They also often hedge those bets, when they can, with a different investment to minimize the damage in case their main bet goes bad. But investors/traders all rely on the free market staying as free as possible. The essence of the free market is having the ability to make lots of investments in almost anything imaginable, quickly cash out of them, try something else, and have the freedom to maximize successes and minimize failures each time. Despite all the regulations and other occasional roadblocks, the American financial industry has established one of the freest markets in world history. Politicians don't have much of a free market to work with. Not everyone can ""trade"" because the financial and personal cost of campaigning is relatively high for even minor offices. And there aren't very many ""investments"" to make either. The voting public and the mainstream news media simply won't focus on a lot of different issues during the course of an election season. There is no S&P 500 of ""bet-worthy"" political issues; it's more like an ""S&P 3."" So just to make a political bet or investment, a candidate has to really be sure he or she isn't wasting time on a bet no one will care about one way or another. They need to focus on a political issue that is such an essential news-making commodity that it's not likely to be ignored at any time. Right now terrorism and gun violence are examples of two political issues worth betting on, big time. And over the last few weeks, both Donald Trump and President Barack Obama have done just that. When Trump declared last month that he would consider banning all Muslims from immigrating or getting visas to visit the U.S., a lot of the experts were puzzled and stunned. Some even posited that Trump was deliberately trying to commit political suicide to get out of the race. But a very savvy colleague of mine here at CNBC figured it out immediately. As soon as the story broke, he emailed me the following message: ""My God! Trump is going long another Islamist terrorist attack on U.S. soil!"" He understood that in the wake of the San Bernardino attack, Trump was taking a major political bet on the possibility a similar attack by a similar perpetrator would occur. Despite never having served in the military, intelligence services, or in any elected office, Trump can now claim to be the toughest candidate on the issue of Islamist terror inside America. And if God-forbid another San Bernardino-like attack is carried out by Islamist terrorists, it will be very hard for any other candidate to gain in the polls as much as Trump is likely to advance. Again, Trump is not ""rooting for"" a new Islamist terror attack, he is simply positioning his campaign to reap the greatest potential rewards if it does happen. I know it sounds pretty cold and gruesome, but most good traders will tell you that you need to keep emotions and politeness out of it when it comes to investing wisely. Trump is long terror, period. And in the last few days, we've seen President Obama also work to position himself against the same kind of Islamist terror attack on a domestic target. By focusing on guns at this time more than at any other time in his presidency, (which is saying something), Mr. Obama is hedging against such a terrorist attack. Remember that in the first several hours during and after the San Bernardino attack, the general public was not yet aware of the reason for the attack or who was behind it. All we knew was that it was another mass shooting and the usual suspect politicians and pundits wasted no time commenting and Tweeting their anger at the NRA, support for more gun control, etc. Guns and gun violence were the immediate issue injected into the national conversation. And so with the next Islamist attack on American soil likely to be carried out at least in part with guns, President Obama's renewed focus on firearms now is likely to keep the conversation about guns at least initially before the hard questions skewering his immigration and anti-terror policies take center stage. Again, President Obama is not rooting for another mass shooting or terror attack. But he is acting like a cold and calculating Wall Street trader positioning himself with a brilliant hedge to avoid the worse political fallout should such an attack occur. If your response to the above analysis is revulsion that our elected leaders and presidential candidates spend their energy trying to gain politically from expected atrocities... well congratulations, that makes you a normal person. And I feel compelled to repeat my very strong hopes that no more mass shootings or terror attacks of any kind happen ever again in this country and my belief that no political candidate or official is actually rooting for one to occur. But the sad fact is that both are likely to occur once more, and politicians who want to succeed have to position themselves ahead of time like traders make positions ahead of predictable bullish and bearish future events. You can and should be repulsed by this cynicism, but you shouldn't ignore it. Thinking like a politician isn't easy to do, and it's not always easy to think like a trader either. But sometimes combining those two mindsets is the only way to figure out what the heck is going on. Commentary by Jake Novak, supervising producer of ""Power Lunch.""

Shear WASHINGTON — As tears streamed down his face, President Obama on Tuesday condemned the gun violence that has reached across the United States and vowed to curb the bloodshed with or without Congress. “In this room right here, there are a lot of stories. There’s a lot of heartache,” Mr. Obama said in the White House East Room, flanked by relatives of those struck down in mass shootings, including former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. “There’s a lot of resilience, there’s a lot of strength, but there’s also a lot of pain.” For all the emotion he showed, Mr. Obama nonetheless faces legal, political and logistical hurdles that are likely to blunt the effect of the plan he laid out. A number of the executive actions he plans are only suggested “guidance” for federal agencies, not binding regulations. They were framed mostly as clarifying and enforcing existing law, not expanding it. And many of those measures rely on hefty funding increases that a Republican-led Congress is almost certain to reject. Among other measures, the plan aims to better define who should be licensed as a gun dealer and thus be required to conduct background checks on customers to weed out prohibited buyers. Even the administration said it was impossible to gauge how big an effect the steps might have, how many new gun sales might be regulated or how many illegal guns might be taken off the streets. “I don’t think anyone can credibly tell you yet what all this means,” Charles E. James Jr., a former federal gun crimes prosecutor who now represents gun industry clients, said of Mr. Obama’s plan. More guns were sold in December than almost any other month in nearly two decades after President Obama called for new gun-buying restrictions. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch told reporters Monday that she could not say whether the new restrictions would have had any effect in a series of recent mass shootings, including last month’s attack in San Bernardino, Calif., that left 14 dead. But in the massacre of nine people at a South Carolina church in June, the man charged, Dylan Roof, was able to buy a .45-caliber handgun despite admitting to drug use. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said at the time that a breakdown in the background check system had allowed Mr. Roof to buy the gun. Mr. Obama voiced irritation over the issue. “Each time this comes up,” Mr. Obama said in his speech, “we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying. I reject that thinking. We know we can’t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence.” Nearly 21 million gun sales were processed through the background check system in 2014, but some industry analysts say as many as 40 percent more firearms could have been sold through private transactions not subject to background checks. Even the most hopeful advocates say the new plan would affect only thousands of sales. Proposals that would have the biggest effect have long been shelved by even the most ardent gun control advocates who now see an assault weapons ban or mandatory gun buyback programs like ones in Australia in 1996 and 2003 as political fantasy. Modest as the new measures may prove to be, the response was unrestrained. Republican presidential candidates and congressional leaders greeted them with peals of protests and angry claims of a “gun grab” that would violate Second Amendment rights. Gun control advocates hailed them as a breakthrough in what has often been a losing battle to toughen firearms restrictions. The families of gun victims and gun control activists crowded into the White House and watched Mr. Obama break down as he recalled the young children gunned down by an assailant in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. “First graders,” the president said, his eyes drifting off and becoming red with tears. He wiped his face and paused to regain his composure: “Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad.” A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check. By taking action, Mr. Obama is purposely stoking a furious political debate that has roiled Congress and spilled over into the presidential campaign. Vowing last year to “politicize” the gun issue after a mass shooting at an Oregon community college, Mr. Obama on Tuesday made good on that promise. The National Rifle Association, targeted by Mr. Obama in his speech, mocked his tears. “The American people do not need more emotional, condescending lectures that are completely devoid of facts,” said Chris W. Cox, the group’s top lobbyist. Republican presidential candidates also raced to condemn Mr. Obama, with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas putting up a web page with a menacing, altered picture of the president in a commando outfit. A caption read “Obama Wants Your Guns” next to a fund-raising appeal. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin posted his opposition on Twitter as the president spoke, saying Mr. Obama’s “words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty.” But Mr. Obama’s allies were equally intense in their defense. Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, posted on Twitter from the East Room: “President wiping tears. So am I. One of the most moving things I’ve ever seen.” Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, posted a “thank you” to Mr. Obama for “taking a crucial step forward on gun violence.” Mr. Obama’s plan is likely to face legal challenges from gun rights groups that accuse him of overstepping his executive authority. A number of critics said they suspected that the president’s push to “clarify” the definition of licensed gun dealers could force even the occasional gun seller to register their transactions. Shortly before Mr. Obama’s remarks, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released guidance to gun sellers on the criteria that could qualify someone as a gun “dealer” who needs to be licensed and conduct background checks. Those criteria include having a website, using business cards or selling new guns in their original packages. The 14-page pamphlet, posted on the agency’s website, offers examples to help guide sellers, such as “Bob,” who wants to sell a gun collection that he inherited (he would not need to be licensed) and “Sharon,” who sells guns at flea markets every weekend (she would need to be licensed). But the administration rejected more aggressive options, such as establishing a defined threshold for the number of gun sales that would qualify someone as a dealer required to conduct background checks. White House officials were mindful of the legal reversals sustained when the president tried to grant legal immigration status by executive action to five million immigrants in the country illegally, and they said they tried to make the gun plan as safe from legal attacks as possible. “This is really pretty modest stuff,” said Ladd Everitt, the communications director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, an advocacy group. Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum in Washington, who attended Mr. Obama’s speech, said many police organizations had been pushing for more background checks on firearm purchases. While he praised Mr. Obama for taking action, he said more needed to be done. “If Congress doesn’t allow for legislation, I think he went as far as he could using the bully pulpit,” Mr. Wexler said. With Congress unwilling to act, many gun control groups have turned to states for changes, with 18 states now imposing some form of background check.

        BuzzFeed News Posted on January 6, 2016, at 9:05 a.m. ET HERE ARE THE TOP STORIES The country made the announcement after an artificial earthquake that registered at a magnitude of 5.1. North Korea called it a “world-startling event,” adding that its test was “conducted in a safe and perfect manner” and “had no adverse impact on the ecological environment,” BuzzFeed News’ Jim Dalrymple II and Dan Vergano report. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby told BuzzFeed News the U.S. was aware of North Korea’s claims but could not confirm them. The head of the Atomic Energy Agency said if North Korea’s H-bomb test is confirmed, it would be a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and “deeply regrettable,” the Associated Press writes. A hydrogen bomb can be far more powerful than a nuclear bomb. Nuclear experts are questioning “if the size of the blast was large enough to have been from an H-bomb,” BBC News reports. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un North Korea has previously conducted three nuclear tests, but this is the first time it has claimed to have detonated a hydrogen bomb. “We will not accept (North Korea) as a nuclear state,” U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Ned Price said. “We will continue to protect and defend our allies in the region, including the Republic of Korea, and will respond appropriately to any and all North Korean provocations.” Last month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un claimed that the country was “ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb [atomic] and H-bomb,” according to BBC News. A map shows the epicenter of the seismic event North Korea claims was a hydrogen bomb test.

WE’RE KEEPING AN EYE ON Things went haywire in the Middle East over the weekend: Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shiite cleric on Saturday, as well as 46 other prisoners, which sparked fury in Iran and led to Iranians ransacking the Saudi embassy in the capital, Tehran. Since then, Saudi Arabia has severed diplomatic ties with Iran, and Kuwait, Sudan, and Bahrain have downgraded their relations as well. But why all the drama? The strife between the two countries is geopolitical — “both are theocratic oil exporters with huge militaries and both of them want to be the country that’s on top in the region,” BuzzFeed News’ Hayes Brown writes. Then there’s religion: Saudi Arabia hosts the holiest city in Islam — Mecca — and thinks of itself as the guardian for Sunni Islam. Meanwhile, overwhelmingly Shiite Iran considers itself patron of Islam’s minority sect and wants to boost its regional influence, writes Brown. In October, Iran and Saudi Arabia clashed over the death of more than 400 Iranians killed in a stampede during a pilgrimage to Mecca. The difference between Sunni and Shiite Islam is both simple and complicated, but basically it goes back to an ancient fight over who was the rightful successor to the Prophet Mohammed. If you want to read more about it, check out this explainer from the Council on Foreign Relations. The tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia could empower ISIS in Iraq, by preventing Sunni–Shiite cooperation across the region, writes the New York Times. U.S. officials, meanwhile, are more concerned about the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia than its thawing ties with Iran, BuzzFeed News’ Ali Watkins writes. On Dec. 23, more than 600,000 homes in Ukraine lost all power for several hours. “Now cybersecurity experts are claiming that the power outage was caused by a cyberattack, likely originating in Russia,” BuzzFeed News' Sheera Frenkel reports. Ukraine’s security service blames Russia for the incident, even though definitively establishing the source of cyberattacks is always difficult. “It’s a milestone because we’ve definitely seen targeted destructive events against energy before — oil firms, for instance — but never the event which causes the blackout,” John Hultquist, head of the cybersecurity firm iSight’s cyber espionage intelligence practice, told ArsTechnica. “It’s the major scenario we’ve all been concerned about for so long.” DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? BuzzFeed News’ Alex Kantrowitz spent the last night of 2015 in a car with the co-founder of the ride-hailing app: “It’s 8:33 p.m. on Dec. 31, and Lyft co-founder and President John Zimmer is sitting in his hybrid Volkswagen Jetta on a side street in San Francisco’s Mission District, waiting for his first rider of the night. For the third year in a row, Zimmer is spending his New Year’s Eve the same way thousands of his company’s contract employees do: driving around the city, catching fares. “New Year’s Eve is critical for ride-hailing companies like Lyft and Uber: It’s one of the highest-demand nights of the year, when scores and scores of people — longtime devotees and brand-new users alike — will pull up Zimmer’s app, looking for a better way to get from point A to point B. But it’s also when Lyft’s central sales pitch — that its service is fundamentally faster, cheaper, and more efficient than the yellow cabs that have performed the same service for decades — is put to the test. If Lyft makes you wait five or ten minutes longer than a cab would, then there’s little reason to use it. “I ask Zimmer what it’s like competing with Uber, a company notorious for its ruthless competitive tactics. Zimmer offers a simple response: customer service. The company, he says, looks out for drivers, offering them perks such as the opportunity to earn tips and get paid instantly. Same for customers, he says, telling me Lyft capped its version of surge pricing (called Primetime) on New Year’s Eve, for instance, to twice that of normal fares. (Uber did not; New Year’s day brought the annual spate of stories about people waking up in horror to $500 ride bills).” Happy New Year! 3rd year of @lyft driving tradition, full Lyft Line :) Natalie, Pearl &amp; Gabe @young_6eezy U.S. President Barack Obama delivered an emotional speech on gun control yesterday, during which he outlined a series of executive actions designed to expand background checks on firearm sales including online and at gun shows.

          / AP LAS VEGAS - Weapon enthusiasts had their sights set on the latest and newest guns and gear at a big industry trade show this week, not on President Barack Obama's efforts to tighten gun-ownership regulations following mass shootings around the country. ""America is a culture of guns,"" SilencerCo Chief Executive Josh Waldron said Wednesday at the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show in Las Vegas. ""Americans will not stand for politicians taking their guns away."" ""The president has done everything he can do to pass anti-gun legislation,"" Waldron added, ""and let's face it, he hasn't been able to do anything other than help an industry sell more guns than ever.""  Gun production and sales have doubled since 2007 when Obama took office, said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and attorney for the show host, the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Sales spike after every headline-grabbing mass shooting like the recent ones in Paris and San Bernardino, California. Almost one in three Americans is a gun owner, Keane said. He tallied about 350 million guns in circulation. ""The face of the consumer is more diverse -- women, minorities, younger and urban,"" Keane said. Sales surge ""when you have an event that causes people to talk about the issue and causes people to be concerned about their safety."" ""Guns will clearly be one of the big issues this November,"" he said, referring to the presidential and congressional elections. Keane's comments Tuesday came a day before U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch went before Congress to defend executive actions issued Jan. 4 by Obama to require nearly anyone selling guns online or at gun shows to get federal dealers' licenses and perform background checks. Republican presidential candidates and conservative lawmakers have condemned the president's move as an overreach of executive power and an infringement of constitutional rights to gun ownership. Some of the 62,000 credentialed attendees walked amid miles of aisles on the showroom floor in Las Vegas, ogling and handling chrome six-shooters, knives, body armor and assault-style weapons. The Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show isn't a sales event. No one can buy guns or gear on the spot. Show-goer Rhiannon Owen, co-owner with her husband of a San Antonio, Texas, body armor company, said people have a right to protect themselves. ""And because of the political climate in our country, more people are becoming involved,"" she said. Owen sells a $300 kit to protect a person from anything up to a .308-caliber bullet. It can be carried in a gym bag or kept next to a bed to don quickly if the owner is threatened by someone with a gun. Schoolteachers could be equipped with ballistic blankets and custom locks for classroom door hinges to protect children, she said. Gun-control advocate Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, derided the idea of making schools ""more like armories than places of education ... where our only solutions are to deal with active shooters."" ""There is so much more we can do to keep guns out of the hands of those intent on doing harm in the first place,"" Gross said by email. He cited the nearly 34,000 gun deaths tallied nationwide in 2010 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and a separate 2014 report from the nonprofit Violence Policy Center advocacy group that more people die from guns than from vehicle crashes in 21 states and the District of Columbia. The Brady Campaign wants background checks expanded to all gun sales, including at gun shows and online. Owen said she'd be willing to perform background checks on buyers of ballistic gear, particularly if the National Instant Criminal Background Check System was more complete and able to provide faster responses for applicants. Waldron predicted the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will have trouble processing a wave of new fingerprint cards, photos and background checks. Keane said the shooting sports foundation hosts a campaign called FixNICS.org to encourage states to report to the FBI's NICS database all mental health and criminal records of anyone prohibited from owning a firearm under current law. On the trade show floor, more than 30 ATF agents fielded questions at an information booth about whether Obama's actions mean that casual gun owners will need to get federal firearm sales licenses. ""We're listening to what people are telling us,"" ATF spokesman Corey Ray said. ""Someone has a collection at home and wants to sell the guns. They wonder if they need a firearms license."" They don't, Ray said. ""Not if they aren't engaged in the business and aren't making a living doing it."" First published on January 20, 2016 / 4:29 PM © 2016 The Associated Press.

Tuesday, 05 January 2016 04:31 PM Obama made it clear he does not expect gun laws to change during his remaining year in office, but pledged to do what he can to make gun control a theme in the months leading up to the November election to replace him. In a powerful address in the White House, surrounded by family members of people killed in shootings, Obama's voice rose to a yell as he said the constitutional rights of Americans to bear arms needed to be balanced by the right to worship, gather peacefully and live their lives. Obama has often said his toughest time in office was grappling with the December 2012 massacre of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. ""Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,"" Obama said, tears rolling down his cheek. ""That changed me, that day,"" he said, after being introduced by Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son was killed in the shooting. ""My hope earnestly has been that it would change the country."" After that tragedy, the Democratic president failed to persuade Congress to toughen U.S. gun laws. He has blamed lawmakers for being in the thrall of the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby group. Obama, comparing the issue to the great civil rights causes of his time, is set to discuss gun violence again during a live televised town hall on CNN on Thursday, and during his State of the Union address next Tuesday. Vice President Joe Biden is slated to do a series of television interviews on the topic on Wednesday. LEGAL CHALLENGES EXPECTED The U.S. Constitution's 2nd Amendment gives Americans the right to have arms, a right that is fiercely defended. Obama laid out executive action he is taking to require more gun sellers to get licenses and more gun buyers to undergo background checks. Under the changes, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is issuing guidelines intended to narrow exceptions to a system that requires sellers to check with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether buyers have criminal records, are charged with crimes or have mental health conditions that would bar them from owning a gun. The proposal is ""ripe for abuse"" by the government, said Chris Cox, an official with the NRA, in a statement, adding that the group will continue to fight to protect Americans' constitutional rights. Legal challenges to the changes, which are contained in guidance from the ATF, are expected. The crucial question in any direct legal challenge will be whether the ATF guidance creates new obligations, or merely clarifies existing law. The more the Obama administration acts as though the guidance has created a new legal requirement, the more legal trouble it might invite, said Lisa Heinzerling, administrative law professor at Georgetown University. The stocks of gunmakers Smith & Wesson Holding Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co Inc have climbed since the announcement. On Tuesday, Smith & Wesson ended up 11.1 percent to $25.86 a share and Sturm Ruger closed up 6.8 percent at $65.54. REPUBLICANS VOW TO FIGHT Republican leaders were quick to denounce Obama's gun changes, with most Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential race promising to reverse his actions if they win the White House. Democratic candidates praised the moves. Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, said the changes were ""all about burnishing the president's legacy and boosting Democrat enthusiasm in a presidential election year."" Republicans who control Congress made it clear that they oppose the changes, although some downplayed their significance. ""Ultimately, this executive 'guidance' is only a weak gesture - a shell of what the president actually wants,"" said Kevin McCarthy, leader of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. © 2021 Thomson/Reuters.

329,http://dailycaller.com/2016/01/06/gun-violence-is-a-tragedy-but-emotions-shouldnt-override-the-rule-of-law/,"Guns/Getty Images) Gun control is once again in the news, as President Obama took to the airwaves this morning to announce that he is undertaking executive actions on the issue. His executive order will, among other things, expand background checks, in particular closing the so called “gun show” loophole that allowed small firearm sellers to avoid being required to do background checks. The executive action follows a recent spate of mass shootings, which in prompted The New York Times to run their first front page editorial in decades, last December. Just like the editorial, Obama’s announcement was filled with emotion, with the president shedding tears at one point during the press conference. There is an understandable emotional theme throughout this discourse, but it’s based on the premise that gun deaths and mass shootings are out of control. Fortunately, all evidence seems to say the opposite. As Mark Perry at the American Enterprise Institute points out, the gun homicide rate has dropped 49 percent since 1993, while the number of privately owned firearms has increased 56 percent. This fact seems to have largely been left out of post-mass shooting narratives. As a result, a majority of Americans mistakenly believe that gun violence is not only rising, but spiraling out of control. Even President Obama’s much touted claim that mass shootings only occur in the United States seems to ignore the facts. As John Lott of the Crime Prevention Research Center points out, the United States is not even in first place when it comes to the annual death rate, or the frequency of mass shootings, let alone the only place where such events occur. Any shooting is a tragedy, but using the outpouring of emotion from such a tragedy to carry out one’s own political agenda and deprive people of their rights is simply unacceptable. The condescension exemplified by The New York Times is inappropriate behavior for a respected news organization who claims to be interested in debating an important issue for the good of society. In light of the clear evidence of decreasing gun homicides, it’s clear that  the moral panic promoted by progressives is based in emotion rather than fact. There is nothing wrong in becoming emotional in the face of acts of incomprehensible evil, but there is great danger in enacting policy based merely on emotional impulses. Emotion clouds logic. Unfortunately, the reliance on emotion over logic that is inspiring progressives to promote gun control is, at the same time, is being used by demagogues like Donald Trump to justify closing the border to Muslims, increasing domestic surveillance, and eroding civil liberties. The Constitution and the rule of law are meant to ensure that individual rights remain secure, even in the face of emotional tragedies. So before progressives champion President Obama’s executive actions, they should consider what might happen if their ideological opponents were the ones unconstrained by the rule of law in the wake of a tragedy.

By POLITICO PRO STAFF 01/12/2016 05:08 AM EST The scorecard: 19 clear policy victories, 15 clear-cut losses and 24 ideas that were a draw. | Getty For six consecutive years, President Barack Obama used his State of the Union address to call for immigration reform. In three other State of the Union speeches, Obama has called for raising the federal minimum wage. And twice he’s expressed the urgency of campaign finance reform. State of the Union addresses are often judged by how many times Congress applauded — or jeered, what pundits thought of the rhetoric and who appeared as special guests in the House gallery. POLITICO examined dozens of these plans and promises in advance of his final address Tuesday night and found that Obama won more than he lost — though the most-likely outcome for any idea was somewhere in the middle. The scorecard: 19 clear policy victories, 15 clear-cut losses and 24 ideas that were a draw. Many of Obama’s wins came with the aid of Congress, including extending health coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, opening access to the military for gays and making permanent a college tuition tax credit for families. But other proposals got no traction at all, also thanks to Congress or because new, more pressing crises or changing interests intervened. Campaign finance reform went nowhere. An effort to double exports by the end of his sixth year in office fell flat. The country’s roads host fewer than half of the 1 million electric cars Obama hoped for by the end of 2015. His pleas for gun control after the Sandy Hook massacre fell on deaf ears. Much like the Obama presidency itself, the scorecard of the Obama State of the Union proposals reflects major wins, significant setbacks, and many lofty ideas that fell victim to a divided electorate and a dysfunctional Congress. Immigration reform: Draw “And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system — to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation.” — 2010 “Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws, and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows.” — 2011 ""I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That's why my administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office. The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. ... Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.” — 2012 “Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants. And right now leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities, they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform. ... we know what needs to be done. … Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away. And America will be better for it.” — 2013 “Finally, if we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders and law enforcement — and fix our broken immigration system. ... So let’s get immigration reform done this year.” — 2014 “Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that it’s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I’ve talked to Republicans and Democrats about that. That’s something that we can share.” — 2015 By NOAH WEILAND Congress made an ambitious, if failed attempt at immigration reform during the 113th Congress, when the Senate passed an Obama-backed overhaul of the immigration system but the House never followed suit. However, the president did establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2012, allowing hundreds of thousands of young adults who came to the U.S. illegally, as children, to remain in the country and work legally. An expansion of the program that would protect more than 4 million immigrants here illegally — primarily undocumented parents of U.S. citizen children and green card holders — is on hold indefinitely because of legal challenges. And now the Obama administration has taken on a more aggressive enforcement strategy, targeting children and parents who came here illegally after 2014. Gays in the military: Win ""This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are."" — 2010 Congress repealed the “don’t ask, don’t tell” law later that year — and since Sept. 20, 2011, gays have served openly in the military. Guantanamo Bay: Lose “That is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists — because living our values doesn’t make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger. — 2009 The U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is still open, and the president is still working to close it by the end of his term, despite congressional roadblocks. Gun control: Lose “Overwhelming majorities of Americans — Americans who believe in the Second Amendment — have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they’re tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned. Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress.” — 2013 Photo gallery By DIANA D’ABRUZZO Even the emotional pull of the late 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School couldn’t save the White House’s effort to push new gun control measures through Congress, led by Vice President Joe Biden. Democrats quickly dropped a bid to renew the assault weapons ban, and a measure imposing near-universal background checks — sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) — failed to overcome a filibuster. After each successive mass shooting, Obama has bitterly excoriated Congress for not acting on guns while acknowledging that the political environment makes new legislation impossible. Last week, he announced new executive actions, but the modest new guidelines for existing rules would probably have minimal impact on expanding background checks. Trade promotion authority: Win “And that's why I'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free, but are also fair. It's the right thing to do.” — 2015 Congress passed the legislation along party lines in June after a bitter fight that pitted most Democrats and labor unions against the majority of Republicans and major business groups. The law gives Obama the authority to submit trade deals to Congress for up-or-down votes, without amendments, queuing up the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which the administration wrapped up with the governments of 11 other nations in October, for possible passage sometime this year. Abusive lending crackdowns: Draw “And tonight I'm asking my attorney general to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.” — 2012 The Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, formed in 2012, has wrested tens of billions of dollars in settlements from some of the nation’s largest banks, including payouts to homeowners facing foreclosure. But it has faced some criticism from lawmakers and public-interest groups for making few attempts to prosecute the individuals involved in the fraud that caused the housing meltdown. Climate strategy: Win ""I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will."" — 2013 Congress didn’t take up Obama’s challenge, but he did, unveiling an ambitious climate strategy in August 2013 that included the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s landmark greenhouse gas restrictions for power plants. The administration also helped lead a historic international climate deal reached last month in Paris and is moving ahead with tougher fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks. The EPA regulations will face scrutiny in the courts, and time will tell how far the U.S. and other major polluters like China and India uphold the Paris agreement, which for the most part is not legally binding. Iraq: Draw “As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as president. We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August.” — 2010 The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has drawn about 3,500 U.S. forces back into Iraq as advisers, trainers and facilitators in the new war against ISIL. The president has also authorized the deployment of about 50 special forces for special missions into Syria. Net neutrality: Win “I intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every classroom and every community…” — 2015 The Federal Communications Commission adopted Open Internet rules in February 2015 that ban broadband providers from blocking or slowing broadband traffic. Campaign finance reform: Lose “Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections. … I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.” — 2010 “Let's make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress and vice versa, an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.” — 2012 Photo essay By JENNIFER SHUTT A few months after Obama's 2010 State of the Union, congressional Democrats introduced the DISCLOSE Act, which would have limited political spending by companies with foreign ownership or government contracts and required certain outside groups to reveal their top donors in their ads and online. But Senate Republicans blocked the bill after a significantly altered version passed the House. That’s as far as campaign finance reform legislation has gotten during Obama’s presidency. Tax reform: Lose “...Tonight I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system, get rid of the loopholes, level the playing field, and use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years without adding to our deficit.” — 2011 While Republicans and Democrats in Congress generally agree that comprehensive tax reform is needed, the effort has failed to get off the ground. Afghanistan: Draw “Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.” — 2013 “Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.” — 2015 Nearly 10,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan to train Afghan security forces and conduct counterterrorism missions. And the top U.S. commander there, Gen. John Campbell, wants to keep as many troops there as long as possible through this year and may seek more. Student loan reform: Win “To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase Pell Grants. And let's tell another 1 million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years — and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.” — 2010 Congress cut banks out of federal student loans and poured $36 billion into Pell Grants. The administration eventually made income-based repayment plans available to all Direct Loan borrowers. Offshore oil and gas production: Draw ""Over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources."" — 2012 The oil industry asserts that Obama’s words actually left out more than 80 percent of potential offshore production, thanks to long-standing prohibitions on drilling in areas such as the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines. The Interior Department has proposed opening up additional waters along the southeastern Atlantic and studying their potential oil and gas resources — much to the consternation of green groups — but any actual production there is years away at the earliest. Wireless access: Win “Within the next five years, we'll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans. This isn't just about — this isn't about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls. It's about connecting every part of America to the digital age.” — 2011 Now some 99 percent of American households have access to at least one wireless carrier that offers 4G/LTE service, according to CTIA, the wireless industry’s trade group. Much of that had to do with wireless carriers building out networks on airwaves they acquired in a 2008 FCC auction. But in 2010 the Obama administration proposed to make at least 500 megahertz of new spectrum available for wireless networks in 10 years. Federal agencies have been working toward that goal, including an auction of TV airwaves scheduled for later this year. Voting rights: Draw “Tonight I'm announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America. … We can fix this, and we will.” — 2013 “Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened, but conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it. And the bipartisan Commission I appointed, chaired by my campaign lawyer and Gov. Romney's campaign lawyer, came together and have offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half-hour to vote. Let's support these efforts.” — 2014 Obama's commission recommended a slate of reforms to make voting easier and more accessible, but those suggestions have been adopted irregularly. A Common Cause report on battleground states before the 2014 elections found that ""none of the covered states has fully adopted all of the Commission's recommendations ... However, not a single state has entirely ignored all of the recommendations, either."" Surveillance reform: Win “That's why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs, because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that privacy of ordinary people is not being violated.” — 2014 The USA Freedom Act was enacted in early June 2015. Privacy advocates didn’t love it, but the law curbed the National Security Agency’s mass data collection program by requiring telecom companies, not the government, to store phone call metadata. Those records would only be allowed to be accessed if a special federal court granted permission. Doubling exports in five years: Lose “...we need to export more of our goods, because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. So tonight we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America. To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security. — 2010 Obama’s ambitious goal would have required raising exports to more than $3 trillion by the end of 2014. In part because of a slowdown in global economic growth, as well as the European recession that began in 2012, the administration’s efforts fell short at $2.35 trillion. Small business tax credit: Win “I'm … proposing a new small business tax credit, one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small-business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.” — 2010 In 2010, Congress passed legislation that included a tax credit for businesses that hire unemployed workers, eliminated capital gains taxes for small business investors and allowed more generous depreciation for capital investments. Minimum wage for federal contractors: Win “I will issue an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour — because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dishes, you shouldn’t have to live in poverty.” — 2014 In February 2014, the president signed an executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10. The Labor Department published a final rule implementing the executive order in October 2014. Overtime: Win “We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned.” — 2015 The Labor Department is on track to release a final overtime rule by July 2016. The proposed rule would raise to $50,440 the salary under which virtually all employees are guaranteed time and a half pay. Permanent college tuition tax credit for families: Win “... families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500 tax credit for all four years of college.” — 2009 “And this year, I ask Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit — worth $10,000 for four years of college. It’s the right thing to do.” — Jan. 25, 2011 A last-minute congressional tax deal in December made the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent. Financial crisis responsibility fee: Lose “I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. Now, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea. But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.” — 2010 Obama proposed this fee to help recover the net cost of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the federal government’s effort to stabilize the financial system in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. He included it in subsequent budget proposals, but it was never imposed. Expanding early learning: Draw “So tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America. That's something we should be able to do.” — 2013 “I’m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K they need.” — 2014. Obama’s sweeping proposal to expand preschool in the states fell flat with nearly all Republicans on Capitol Hill. But he has seen more modest gains in early education and did bring together a coalition to help expand pre-kindergarten in the states. Patent reform: Lose “And let's pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly and needless litigation.” — 2014 Congress has been debating patent reform legislation designed to curb lawsuits from so-called patent trolls, who acquire patents in order to sue other companies for infringement, for several years. But lawmakers still haven’t agreed on what to do. Green electricity: Win ""Thanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation’s supply of renewable energy in the next three years."" — 2009 By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE Specifically, Obama's goal was to double the nation’s installed solar, wind and geothermal capacity to 57.6 gigawatts by the end of 2011. The U.S. technically fell just short of his goal, reaching just 54.9 gigawatts during that period. But projects already under way continued to send those totals soaring. By the end of 2012, wind and solar capacity alone had a total of roughly 68 total gigawatts installed. Trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia: Win “And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia.” — 2010 Obama reopened trade negotiations with South Korea, Panama and Colombia, which began under George W. Bush’s administration, during his first term as part of his effort to reenergize the sluggish economy. The updated trade deals included stronger labor, environmental and human rights protections and gained congressional approval largely along partisan lines in late 2011, with most Republicans and some centrist Democrats in support. Ending tax breaks for companies that move jobs abroad: Lose “…[I]t is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America.” — 2010 Democrats proposed legislation in 2010 and 2012 to eliminate the standard deduction for moving expenses for businesses relocating to other countries. Companies that brought jobs back to America would have gotten a 20 percent tax credit for their expenses. Both efforts failed. Innovation in education: Draw “We’ll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps. And we will expand our commitment to charter schools.” — 2009 “Now, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools. And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform.” — 2010 The administration poured more than $12 billion into competitive grant programs like Race to the Top and the School Improvement Grant program, which promoted the expansion of charter schools when traditional public schools were failing. The administration has said the programs pushed states and schools to make important changes, while experts says results are uneven. ‘Buffett Rule’: Lose “Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule. If you make more than a million dollars a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.” — 2012 Democrats latched on to the idea after billionaire investor Warren Buffett decried the fact that wealthy people like him pay less in taxes as a portion of their income than lower-earning taxpayers. While legislation to implement the Buffett Rule was introduced, it failed to pass. International tax reform for highway funding: Lose “Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our Tax Code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here and reward companies that keep profits abroad. … Let's work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home. Moreover, we can take the money we save from this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes.” — 2014 Congress made a stab at using international tax reform to fund an extension of the Highway Trust Fund, but while top House tax writers were in favor of the move, Senate leaders rejected the idea. Linking value to federal financial aid: Draw “I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid. And tomorrow, my administration will release a new ‘College Scorecard’ that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria — where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.” — 2013 Congress has not reauthorized the Higher Education Act or agreed to tie federal aid to college performance. But the administration did create and later expand the College Scorecard to make it easier for families to compare schools on measures like former students’ earnings. High speed rail: Lose “Within 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail. This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car. For some trips, it will be faster than flying — without the pat-down. As we speak, routes in California and the Midwest are already underway.” — 2011 Still drafting off the 2009 economic stimulus, Obama used this speech to sketch a blue sky dream for the $8 billion that the package had provided for high-speed and intercity passenger rail, calling it a down payment on the steps needed to connect the vast majority of Americans to a high-speed rail network. But that money was mostly used to upgrade existing lines, and only a portion of them meet even the United States’ anemic definition of “high speed.” Though it’s been far from 25 years since his speech, building a U.S. high-speed rail network would take vastly more than $8 billion, which would require the cooperation of Congress. Equal pay for women: Draw “We're going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws — so that women get equal pay for an equal day's work.” — 2010 “And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year.” — 2013 “That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. It’s 2015. It’s time.” — 2015 Although Congress has not passed the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would require employers to demonstrate that pay disparity between men and women is based on job performance and would prohibit employer retaliation for sharing salary information with co-workers, Obama issued a 2014 executive order that prohibits federal contractors from retaliating against employees who discuss their compensation — a step intended to help close the gender wage gap. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs issued a final rule in September implementing the executive order. The rule is now in effect. More college graduates: Lose “By 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.” — 2009 Recent research shows that college completion rates are declining. Asia-Pacific and European Union trade deals: Draw “To boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight I'm announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the European Union, because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.” — 2013 The administration completed negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would lower trade barriers among 12 nations, but it’s not clear the president can convince congressional Republicans to approve the deal because of disagreements over patent protections for biologic drugs and a tobacco provision, among other issues. The administration is trying to conclude an even bigger deal with the European Union but the pace of talks have been slow. Even if a deal is struck, it would be up to the next president to win congressional approval. More training, apprenticeships for workers: Win I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships — opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education. — 2015 Obama launched the TechHire initiative, which got companies and communities to offer training, such as coding boot camps, to low-income workers and minorities. And the administration launched a $100 million grant competition for innovative training programs. Mortgage refinancing: Draw “We have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages. … In fact, the average family who refinances today can save nearly $2,000 per year on their mortgage.” — 2009 “I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically low rates.… A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.” — 2012 “Right now there's a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today's rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported it before, so what are we waiting for?” — 2013 More than 3 million borrowers have refinanced their mortgages and obtained lower interest rates using the Home Affordable Refinance Program since it began 2009. But only homeowners whose loans are backed by government-owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are eligible for the program, which expires at the end of 2016. Though Obama exhorted lawmakers two years in a row to extend the program to all mortgages, his plan for a fee on banks to pay for it went nowhere in Congress. Energy Security Trust: Lose ""In fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together. So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good."" — 2013 Obama's idea to funnel $2 billion in offshore drilling revenue to pay for research into alternative fuel and vehicles never gained traction in either party on Capitol Hill and faded fast. Small Business Lending Fund: Draw “I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat.” — 2010 The Small Business Lending Fund was established in 2011, but it gave out only about $4 billion to community banks, not the $30 billion Obama originally envisioned. Banks participating in the program had increased their small-business lending by $17.2 billion by June 2015. Better Internet in schools: Draw “Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years. Tonight I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint and Verizon, we've got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and 20 million students over the next two years, without adding a dime to the deficit.” — 2014 The White House said last year that the private sector has pledged $2 billion in tech goods and services. The FCC chipped in an additional $2 billion in funding in 2014 for school Wi-Fi and increased the amount that can be spent to help subsidize school Internet service, which it says will meet schools' needs within the next few years. But two years away from the president’s self-imposed deadline, a majority of school districts nationally still report that their Internet access isn’t sufficient. More than two-thirds of school systems surveyed in a 2015 report said they didn’t have enough Internet bandwidth to keep up with student demand today or the next 18 months. Speeding up transportation projects: Win “In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects.” — 2012 “But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.”— 2014 Obama took several executive actions aimed at streamlining the federal approval process for transportation projects. Congress acted as well, using two major transportation bills to consolidate programs and streamline reviews for infrastructure projects. Earned-income tax credit expansion: Draw “There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the earned-income tax credit. … I agree with Republicans like Sen. Rubio that it doesn't do enough for single workers who don't have kids. So let's work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, help more Americans get ahead.” — 2014 Democrats won a major expansion of the EITC as part of last month’s tax package. The idea of extending the credit to more single workers without children has strong support among Democrats and some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. But while legislation has been introduced to expand the EITC for single workers without children, it has not advanced. High school innovation contest: Win “Tonight, I’m announcing a new challenge to redesign America’s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy.” — 2013 Using $100 million in fees from H1B visas, the administration selected 24 grantees that are now redesigning their high schools to add rigorous career and technical programs. Electric vehicles: Lose ""With more research and incentives, we can … become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015."" — 2011 By 2013, administration officials had already started backing away from the goal Obama declared for U.S. consumers to purchase electric plug-in vehicles. In the past five years, automakers have sold just more than 400,000 of those vehicles in the United States, according to the latest figures compiled by the publication Inside EVs. At the pace set in the past two years, it would take another four to five years to bring the cumulative sales to more than 1 million. Federal minimum wage: Draw “Tonight, let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.” — 2013 “Today, the federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here. Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10.” — 2014 “And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.” — 2015 Congress has not raised the minimum wage in spite of a $10.10 proposal from Sen. Tom Harkin and Rep. George Miller in 2013, a $12 proposal from Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Bobby Scott in 2015, and a $15 proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders, also in 2015. However, 29 states and the District of Columbia have taken matters into their own hands, increasing minimum wages above the federal rate of $7.25. Free community college: Draw “I’m sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college — to zero.” — 2015 Free community college was dead on arrival in Congress. But Oregon passed a free community college bill, Minnesota launched a pilot program, and several other states considered legislation. ‘Fix it First’: Lose “So tonight, I propose a ‘Fix-It-First’ program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers don’t shoulder the whole burden, I’m also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools worthy of our children.” — 2013 Obama’s proposed $50 billion “Fix-It-First” package was supposed to be something like the stimulus that would have included $40 billion for deferred maintenance on bridges, highways, transit systems and airports, drawn from a “front loaded” first year of a transportation bill. But lawmakers never went along with anything close to that — even when they passed a $305 billion, five-year transportation bill at the end of 2015. Obama’s “Partnership to Rebuild America” was essentially a wish list, including proposals for an infrastructure bank (not enacted), “America Fast Forward Bonds” (not enacted), and $4 billion for transportation-related grant and loan programs (funded, but at much lower levels than the administration proposed). Paid leave: Draw “Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It’s the right thing to do.” — 2015 Congress still has not passed the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, to set up a national paid family and medical leave insurance program, or the Healthy Families Act, which would give workers in businesses with at least 15 employees up to seven days of annual paid sick leave. Members of the administration, including Labor Secretary Tom Perez and senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, have met with employers and state and local officials to promote paid leave policies. The Labor Department’s Women’s Bureau has also awarded grants to support research into the feasibility of paid leave programs at the state and local level. Expand opportunities for young men of color: Win “And I’m reaching out to some of America’s leading foundations and corporations on a new initiative to help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential."" — 2014 Obama soon launched the legacy-building My Brother’s Keeper initiative, which is focused on increasing opportunities for boys and young men of color. The administration secured hundreds of millions of dollars of outside support for the effort from foundations and corporations. Auto IRA: Draw “And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to nothing for middle-class Americans. Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can.” — 2014 By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL Congress has not passed any legislation that establishes a federal auto-IRA program, but states including New Jersey and Connecticut are looking into this option. So far, Illinois and Oregon are the only states with their own auto-IRA programs. In November, the Labor Department proposed a rule intended to encourage these state-based programs by clarifying when they are exempt from coverage under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. MyRA: Win “I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA. It’s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg. MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.” — 2014 The Treasury Department made myRA accounts nationally available in November 2015. The myRA accounts provide employees who do not have access to a retirement account at work with a savings option. MyRA accounts have no fees and invest only in government savings bonds. Ending Bush-era tax breaks for wealthy: Draw “In order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.” — 2009 In the 2013 fiscal cliff deal, Congress allowed tax breaks to lapse for the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers — couples earning above $450,000 and individuals earning above $400,000. Cybersecurity: Draw “Earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs and our privacy.” — 2013 “I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyberattacks, combat identity theft and protect our children’s information. That should be a bipartisan effort.” — 2015 The 2013 executive order created a voluntary process to help companies share information about cybersecurity threats with the government and each other, and Congress passed legislation last month that significantly lowers the legal barriers for companies to participate. But only about one-quarter of the cyber experts questioned by POLITICO said they believe the legislation will reduce breaches. None of these efforts has prevented a slew of damaging cyberattacks on both major companies and the government, including the thefts of sensitive federal personnel records on more than 22 million people. Infrastructure stimulus: Draw “Over the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs. More than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector — jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges; constructing wind turbines and solar panels; laying broadband and expanding mass transit.” — 2009 Obama’s $787 billion economic stimulus package was sold as a jobs-boosting infrastructure plan, but its spending on transportation was relatively meager: Only about $64 billion went to roads, bridges, rail, transit and aviation. Despite the administration’s priority on “shovel-ready” projects, the money was slow to roll out, wasn’t nearly enough to cover nationwide maintenance backlogs, and opened the administration to criticism about whether the money has been well-spent. Use federal law to expand education reform: Draw “When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand [reforms] to all 50 states. Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.” — 2010 Reauthorization of the law, which didn’t happen for five more years, gives states flexibility to rethink many Obama-era reforms. The administration did push reforms however, through its waivers from the No Child Left Behind law. And a 2010 law gave community colleges $2 billion for job training. Change high school dropout rules: Draw “When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better. So tonight, I am proposing that every state — every state — requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18.” — 2012 Three states have raised the upper age limit on compulsory schooling since 2013, and about half of all states require students to attend school until they are 18. Obamacare: Win “But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough. So let there be no doubt: health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year.” —2009 “Don’t walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. Let’s get it done.” — 2010 After 14 months of debate, a Democratic-controlled Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010 without the support of a single Republican. The Supreme Court upheld the law in 2012 but made the expansion of Medicaid optional for states. The law has extended coverage to roughly 17.6 million Americans and survived countless political and legal attacks. Obama has accomplished much of what he hoped to achieve on health care but at a high political price. The nonstop controversy has made it hard for his administration to address the law’s problems.

Tuesday, 02 February 2016 06:33 AM Study your surroundings. Find exits. Identify makeshift weapons. Americans are gleaning those tips and others as they pack classes on how to react to and survive a shooting. Such training is already common at schools, colleges and businesses, but sessions for the general public are the next step in confronting fears of mass violence that have been around for years and, for many, came to a head after the 1999 Columbine High School shootings. Police have offered the ""awareness training"" in Livonia, Michigan, and Douglasville, Georgia, while more than 600 people have attended classes taught by the Potter County Sheriff's Office in Amarillo, Texas, beginning about three years ago. Public demand increased dramatically after the mass shooting in December that killed 14 in San Bernardino, California, said Lt. Scott Giles, a class instructor in Amarillo. ""This is really just something that was born out of necessity,"" Giles said. ""Active shooter events just continue to happen."" Potter County is one of several sheriff's departments that provide training based on the CRASE curriculum: Civilian Response to Active Shooter Events. CRASE teaches an approach dubbed ADD: ""Avoid"" the situation by getting out, ""Deny"" by barricading inside a room, and as a last resort, ""Defend"" by fighting back. A class offered by Westerville, a Columbus suburb, filled up so quickly that a second had to be scheduled for later this month. The city of about 38,000, with a per capita income well above the rest of Ohio, regularly tops lists of the country's best suburbs. ""We just feel the world has changed. There's evil out there,"" said retiree Tom Madine, 67, who attended the first Westerville class last month with his wife, Sue Madine, along with dozens of others. People today understand that such threats are real and could happen in their own communities, said Police Chief Joe Morbitzer. Officers teach a ""Run, Hide, Fight"" curriculum similar to ADD. ""Part of the issue is that people don't know how to avoid becoming victims,"" Morbitzer said. ""In today's society that's bad, that you've got to practice victim avoidance, but you have to."" At the Jan. 28 Westerville class, officers Dan Pignatelli and John Jeffries emphasized ""situational awareness."" They mixed practical tips — for instance, the best exit in an emergency is not always the way you came in, and if you're hiding, always turn the lights off — with case studies from the 1999 Columbine shooting, the 2007 Virginia Tech killings and others. As a last resort, a weapon could be as near as the closest chair, pair of scissors or blunt object, they said. ""You've got to have a game plan,"" Jeffries, a 31-year police veteran, told the audience. His comment was part of a bigger point both instructors drove home throughout the two-hour class: that people must overcome inaction when something bad happens. Instructors in Ohio and elsewhere don't take a position on whether people legally allowed to carry a gun should intervene to stop an attacker. But they worry about what happens once police arrive. ""When a civilian, let alone a trained officer, opens up firing in an active shooter situation, there is a good chance that civilian may be mistaken for the shooter,"" said Philip Schaenman, a security expert who has studied some of the country's worst shootings, including Virginia Tech. Denise Bunsey attended the January class in Westerville with her parents. Afterward, the 36-year-old guidance counselor said the most important lesson was that people have options even in worst-case scenarios. ""Despite what's going on, you really have to have the mindset of, 'I will survive this and I will do anything I can to survive this,'"" Bunsey said. ""I never thought about it in that way."" © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

337,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/s7pU1fRoYAU/,"Monday, President Barack Obama announced his plan to use an executive order on gun control and claimed he is confident his action will be “entirely consistent with the Second Amendment.” Obama said, “I think everybody here is all too familiar with the statistics. We have tens of thousands of people every single year who are killed by guns. We have suicides that are committed by firearms at a rate that far exceeds other countries. We have a frequency of mass shootings that far exceeds other countries in frequency. And although it is my strong belief that for us to get our complete arms around the problem, Congress needs to act. What I asked my team to do is to see what more we could do to strengthen the enforcement and prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands to make sure that criminals, people who are mentally unstable, those who could pose a danger to themselves or others are less likely to get a gun. And I have just received back a report from Attorney General Lynch, Director Comey and Deputy Director Brandon about some of the ideas and initiatives they think can make a difference. And the good news is that these are not only recommendation that are well within my legal authority, and the executive branch, but they’re also ones that the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners, support and believe in. So over the next several days we’ll be rolling out these initiatives. We’ll be making sure that people have a very clear understanding of what can make a difference and what we can do. And although we have to be very clear that this is not going to solve every violent crime in this country, it is not going to prevent every mass shooting, it is not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal, it will potentially save lives in this country and spare families the pain and the extraordinary loss that they have suffered as a consequence of a firearm being in the hands of the wrong people.” “I’m also confident that the recommendations that are being made by my team here are ones that are entirely consistent with the 2nd Amendment and people’s lawful right to bear arms. And we have been very careful recognizing that although we have a strong tradition of gun ownership in this country, that even those who possess firearms for hunting, for self protection and for other legitimate reasons want to make sure that the wrong people don’t have them for the wrong reasons. So I want to say how much I appreciate the outstanding work that the team’s done. Many of them worked over the holidays to get this set of recommendations to me. And I’m looking forward to speaking with the people over the next several days about them. okay?

Speaking with reporters, Strickland said he has ""re-evaluated"" his position on gun control, noting he also supports additional background checks and stopping terrorism suspects from buying firearms. Strickland didn't offer blanket support for an assault weapons ban, saying there is currently no serious proposal in Congress to pass such a measure. But he said he would back a ban ""if it was possible to have an assault weapons ban that was enforceable, and that would be written in such a way that there wouldn't be constant modifications of weapons to be classified as an assault weapon or not an assault weapon."" Strickland said Friday that in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting and other events in recent years, he believes there's now a need for ""some common-sense efforts to curb gun violence in society."" ""I feel, quite frankly,that it's reasonable for people as a result of life experiences to re-evaluate their positions,"" Strickland said. ""And I have re-evaluated my position, and I feel comfortable in having done that."" Strickland's handlers have previously told reporters that following Sandy Hook, the longtime gun-rights advocate now supports additional background checks and stopping terrorism suspects from buying firearms. PG Sittenfeld, Strickland's Democratic primary opponent, said last week that Strickland's supposed change of heart over guns is contradicted by an Ohio Public Radio interview last year during which he touted his past A+ rating from the National Rifle Association and said ""I was the guy who voted against the assault weapons ban"" while he was a congressman. Sittenfeld, a Cincinnati city councilman, quickly put out a release disparaging Strickland's ""ever-shifting position on guns."" ""Maybe the old Ted Strickland should debate the new Ted Strickland--and I'll debate the winner,"" said Sittenfeld, who has been pushing Strickland unsuccessfully to debate him.

But standing beside Hillary Clinton in Ames, Iowa, on Saturday, the former congresswoman said there were two words she looked forward to saying one year from now: “Madame President”. “Hillary is tough,” Giffords said at a rally with Clinton two days before the Iowa caucuses. “In the White House, she will stand up to the gun lobby. That’s why I’m voting for Hillary.” Giffords was joined by her husband, the retired astronaut Mark Kelly, with whom she co-founded the anti-gun violence group Americans for Responsible Solutions after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. They endorsed Clinton earlier this month, but Saturday marked their first appearance on the campaign trail. Clinton has increasingly sought to make gun control a wedge issue between her and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator with whom she is locked in an Iowa polling dead heat. The Clinton campaign has aggressively pushed the narrative that Sanders’ record on gun safety has, on occasion, been more aligned with the agenda of the National Rifle Association. In return, Sanders has consistently pointed to his D- rating from the NRA. “The facts cry out for action,” Clinton said of gun violence at the rally on Saturday, citing statistics showing roughly 33,000 gun-related deaths each year in America. “This is as important a challenge as I think we face here at home. “What is wrong with us? How can we continue to ignore the toll that this is taking on our children and on our country?” Clinton also dismissed opponents who argue that any tightening of gun laws would infringe upon the second amendment. “The actions we take can certainly be done consistent with the constitution and the right of gun owners,” she said. “That has never been a doubt unless you’re a paid lobbyist for the gun lobby.” Saturday’s busy campaign events – for candidates in both parties, ahead of voting on Monday – came at a tense time for the Clinton campaign. Not only are the polls close in Iowa, but on Friday the Obama administration confirmed for the first time that the unsecured home server Clinton used while secretary of state contained some of the US government’s most closely guarded secrets, censoring 22 emails containing material demanding one of the highest levels of classification. Clinton has constantly fought off attacks from Republican candidates over her use of private email while serving as the top US diplomat during Barack Obama’s first term in the White House. On Saturday morning in Iowa, she focused on gun control. In past campaign speeches and on the debate stage, Clinton has pointed to Sanders’ votes against the Brady bill – Reagan-era legislation that imposed federal background checks and a waiting period on gun purchases – and for a 2005 regulation that granted gun manufacturers legal immunity if weapons were used to commit crime. She has also pointed out that Sanders once voted in favor of the so-called “Charleston loophole” – the name for a provision under which a gun sale is required to proceed if a background check is not completed within three days. It was under this loophole that authorities said Dylann Roof, the gunman who killed nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina last June, was able to acquire his gun despite holding a previous drug offense. Sanders, who insists that he has been a tough opponent of the gun lobby and often points to his background in a rural state in which hunting is popular, this week said he now backs – and will in fact co-sponsor – efforts to repeal that 2005 law. Polls of the Democratic field in Iowa constantly show Clinton and Sanders within the margin of error: on Saturday the realclearpolitics.com average of polls in the state had Clinton at 46.8% and Sanders at 44.3%, with former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley way behind at 4.3%. For the Clinton campaign, such figures raise the specter of 2008, when defeat in the state by Obama presaged defeat, from a position of favoritism, in the wider Democratic primary. Sanders holds a healthy lead in New Hampshire, the next state to vote, though nationally Clinton leads by double digits. On Saturday morning, the New York Times announced that it was endorsing Clinton for the Democratic nomination. In a lengthy piece explaining its thinking, the Times’ editorial board compared the two candidates on key issues while dismissing O’Malley as “more suited for the jobs he has already had – governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore – than for president”. “Mrs Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms,” the board wrote. “Mr Sanders’ record on guns is relatively weak.” On the Republican side of the ledger, the Times board wrote: “Governor John Kasich of Ohio, though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race.” On Saturday in Iowa, Clinton appeared at campaign events with her husband, former president Bill Clinton, and her daughter Chelsea. Sanders was also due to host a number of events in Iowa, including an evening rally featuring performances from musical supporters Vampire Weekend and Foster the People.",2016-01-30 16:09:17,'Hillary is tough': Clinton's gun control push gets boost from Gabby Giffords,"politics and government,united states politics and government,elections,presidents and presidency (us),presidential elections (us)",1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Surrounded by gun-control advocates and family members of victims of gun violence, Obama laid out the rationale behind his recently announced slate of executive actions on guns. ""Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,"" Obama said, referring to the 2013 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. As the audience applauded, the president raised his voice, rattling off a list of high-profile shootings. ""Our unalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness — those rights were stripped from college kids in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara,"" Obama said. ""And from high schoolers at Columbine. And from first graders in Newtown. First graders. And from every family who never imagined that their loved one would be taken by a bullet from a gun."" The president unveiled the specifics of his plan, explaining the newly clarified rules that narrow the types of individual ""private"" gun sellers that can sell guns without subjecting their buyers to a background checks. He also noted that the FBI would hire 230 new agents to help process background checks. ""Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license ... or be subject to criminal prosecutions,"" Obama said. ""It doesn't matter whether you're doing it over the internet or a gun show."" Obama also slammed critics of his push for gun-control measures. The president said states loosening gun-control restrictions, specifically Missouri, had, according to some studies, seen an increased likelihood of gun violence. Obama also blasted some Republican presidential candidates who had criticized the president's plan. ""Contrary to claims of some presidential candidates apparently before this meeting, this is not a plot to take away everybody's guns,"" he said. ""You pass a background check, you can purchase a firearm."" He later added, to raucous applause: ""The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they cannot hold America hostage."" ""We do have to feel a sense of urgency about it,"" Obama added. ""Because people are dying and the constant excuses for inaction no longer suffice. That's why we're here today. Not to debate the last mass shooting, but to do something to try and prevent the next one.""",2016-01-05 12:19:07,Obama tears up during emotional gun-control speech,"education and schools,politics and government,united states politics and government,armament, defense and military forces,gun control,firearms",18710,http://www.businessinsider.com
342,https://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/obama-gun-restrictions-217354,"White House The president gets emotional as he remembers Sandy Hook victims and fiercely calls for more rights for those vulnerable to gun violence. By SARAH WHEATON and NICK GASS 01/05/2016 10:02 AM EST Updated 01/05/2016 04:33 PM EST ""I'm not on the ballot again. I'm not looking to score some points. I think we can disagree without impugning other people's motives,"" President Obama said. | Getty President Barack Obama wept openly Tuesday as he delivered a forceful defense of new executive actions on gun violence, a set of modest proposals to tighten loopholes that likely face quick legal challenges and could be vulnerable to reversal by a Republican White House. The president ran through a list of mass shootings that have happened during his time in office, and teared up as he recalled the schoolchildren gunned down in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012. ""First graders in Newtown. First graders,"" Obama said, pausing to collect himself. ""Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad."" Obama offered a new argument to counter gun rights enthusiasts, noting that mass shootings have taken place as Americans have tried to exercise other rights, such as attending worship services or watching a movie. The right to bear firearms is not more important than the right to worship freely or peaceably assemble, he said, and called upon Congress to be ""brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies."" “Every single year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns. Thirty thousand. Suicides, domestic violence, gang shootouts, accidents. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost brothers and sisters or buried their own children,"" he said, flanked in the White House East Room by family members of victims. In making his case, Obama brushed off criticism that he did not respect the Second Amendment, citing his past as a constitutional law professor. ""No matter how many times people try to twist my words around, I taught constitutional law, I know a little bit about this. I get it,"" he said. ""But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment."" ""We do not have to accept this carnage as the price of freedom,"" Obama said. The president also argued that common-sense safety measures used on other equipment should apply to guns as well. ""If we can set it up so you can’t unlock your phone unless you’ve got the right fingerprint, why can’t we do the same thing for our guns?” Obama said.  ""If there’s an app that can help us find a missing tablet — which happens to me often the older I get,” Obama said to laughter, ""if we can do it for your iPad, there’s no reason we can’t do it with a stolen gun. If a child can’t open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure that they can’t pull a trigger on a gun.” Despite the ""general consensus"" for what needs to be done, and support from many gun owners, Obama acknowledged gridlock. ""I'm not on the ballot again. I'm not looking to score some points. I think we can disagree without impugning other people's motives,"" he said. ""But we do have to feel a fierce sense of urgency about it. In Dr. King's words, we need to feel the fierce urgency of now. Because people are dying and the constant excesses for inaction no longer do, no longer suffice. That's why we're here today, not to debate the last mass shooting but to prevent the next one."" As the details of Obama’s actions— and their limited nature — became clear, reactions of Republicans took on a tone that was more dismissive than alarm-raising. While some continued to attack Obama for going after law-abiding citizens’ Second Amendment rights, others pooh-poohed his actions as theater. “Rather than focus on criminals and terrorists,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said, “he goes after the most law-abiding of citizens. His words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty.” Despite such condemnation, there's little chance this GOP-controlled Congress can block the president's latest gun control moves. That's because there are no must-pass bills looming that Republicans could use as vehicles to force Democrats to undo Obama's actions. Furthermore, Senate Democrats would likely block any movement in the Senate on individual bills. And any stand-alone legislation that managed to pass the House and Senate would surely be vetoed by Obama. Ryan said the GOP’s best chance to overturn the executive orders is to elect a Republican president in 2016. Gun rights advocates argue that new restrictions aren’t necessary because gun homicide rates have dropped even as gun ownership has soared. National Rifle Association used blistering language to cast the moves as a way to distract from other more pressing problems, echoing GOP lines of attack. ""Once again, President Obama has chosen to engage in political rhetoric instead of offering meaningful solutions to our nation’s pressing problems,” said NRA Legislative Action Executive Director Chris W. Cox. “Today’s event also represents an ongoing attempt to distract attention away from his lack of a coherent strategy to keep the American people safe from terrorist attacks.” Firearms industry officials, however, had a more nuanced response. The National Shooting Sports Federation, a top trade group, applauded some elements of Obama’s package, including the completion of a long-delayed measure to include more mental health information in the federal background check system. It also cheered plans to bulk up FBI staffing to conduct background checks. In a statement, NSSF called the new requirement to make dealers report guns that were lost or stolen in transit “misdirected,” arguing that participation in a voluntary program is already robust and, if there is going to be a requirement, the onus should be on the buyer to do the reporting. And the new guideline about dealers licenses, NSSF said, “needs considerable clarification and raises questions about enforceability.” Some Republican presidential candidates saw no need to parse the provisions. “When you live by the pen, you die by the pen,” declared Sen. Ted Cruz, a top Republican presidential candidate. “And my pen's got an eraser."" The White House makes no bones about this possibility. That’s all the more reason, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said after the president’s speech on Tuesday, that Congress should pass a more permanent measure. The issue of gun violence has been a perpetual presence during Obama’s presidency due to a series of mass shootings that have grabbed national headlines, perhaps none more so than the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook. “Fort Hood, Binghamton, Aurora, Oak Creek, Newtown, the Navy Yard, Santa Barbara, Charleston, San Bernardino. Too many,” Obama said, ticking through a list of mass shootings since the 2011 Tucson shooting that killed six and injured more than a dozen more, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was in attendance in the East Room. Despite professing an unflinching commitment to curbing gun violence, Obama and Biden have been thwarted by Congress and what Obama calls a lack of national will to change the way Americans think about guns.  Obama has issued more than 20 executive actions, including incentives for states to share background check information and directing the attorney general to review those types of individuals prohibited from having guns. But gun sales have soared, with 2015 expected to have been a record year, as Americans buy up weapons in advance of new restrictions. Likewise, the actions rolled out on Tuesday are not expected to have a huge impact. The measures include a more detailed definition of which gun sellers must apply for a federal dealers license — and therefore conduct background checks for all sales, in a bid to close the so-called gun show loophole. The administration is also finalizing a few other rules that were stuck in a bureaucratic backlog, including new requirements for reporting guns lost or stolen in transit, and a measure that would allow more mental health records to be submitted to the federal background check registry by removing patient privacy limits. The FBI is also adding 230 agents devoted to processing background checks — a 50 percent increase — as it moves toward automating the system. The series of gun-related events this week represents one of Obama's largest pushes on gun control since the collapse of the effort that followed Sandy Hook. The White House is eager to fend off political attacks and to minimize the lobbying from pro-guns-rights groups, and so is preparing a heavy public campaign to explain his moves. On Thursday, Obama partners with CNN for an hourlong town hall to discuss gun violence in prime time. Vice President Biden — who led the administration’s efforts to enact new gun restrictions in 2013 — is also getting in on the act. After standing next to Obama in the East Room on Tuesday, he sat for an interview with NowThis, a news video network geared toward social media, in a bid to target millennials.  On Wednesday, he’ll do a series of interviews with local news affiliates in markets that have been home to high-profile guns-slayings (Hartford, Connecticut; Roanoke, Virginia and Charleston) or in states where gun safety legislation is pending (Columbus, Ohio and Philadelphia). Even as gun control advocates have praised the White House’s efforts, they pledge to still push Congress and Obama to do more. The National Rifle Association, meanwhile, has blanketed the airwaves with ads warning of “a government that would disarm us during the age of terror.” Nick Gass, Lauren French and Nolan D.

343,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2016/01/08/tucson-survivors-mark-5-years-since-mass-shooting/78433714/,"Though the gathering Friday was to remember the victims of a shooting outside Tucson five years ago, among the survivors exchanging hugs, tears and smiles was a woman who lost her son in another mass shooting. Caren Teves, whose son was among 12 killed at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., has been welcomed into the fraternity of survivors of the 2011 shooting at a Safeway grocery store outside Tucson that killed six and wounded 13, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. “They reached out to me,” said Teves, who lives in Phoenix, but drove down for the morning ceremony. “It’s a very difficult thing to grasp unless you’re there.” As the ceremony ended, she stood in the hospital lobby near Patricia Maisch,  the woman who wrestled a magazine of bullets away from the gunman who shot Giffords and fired into the crowd waiting to see her. Maisch's actions prevented the gunman from reloading, “We’re a comfort to each other,” Maisich said. “We’ve taken her into our group. We’ve made her a double survivor.” The ceremony, which has become an annual event in the five years since the shooting, was planned for the grounds outside the Banner University Medical Center, on the expansive lawn where an impromptu memorial of flowers and other items grew in the days following the Jan. 8, 2011, shooting. But the threat of inclement weather moved it inside a hospital auditorium. Patrick Fitzgerald, a hospital chaplain, led the prayers. “We pray for anyone who was wounded emotionally or psychologically,” he said from the stage. “We pray for everyone who bears scars from the day, that they continue to be healed.” He also made an oblique reference to Jared Loughner, the gunman who was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in federal prison for the shooting. “We pray for those suffering any form of mental illness,” he said. “We pray that resources may be provided to give them any treatment they need.” The names of the six dead were read, followed by the 13 who were injured. A bell rang after each name. Across the city, others rang bells at the same time. AZCENTRAL Tucson shooting still seems unreal for parents of Christina-Taylor Green, who never got to grow up This was the first year that Giffords was not in Tucson for the anniversary of the shooting. She and her husband, the retired astronaut Mark Kelly, were in Washington, D.C., and had planned to meet with staff members of their group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, many of whom worked for Giffords while she was in Congress. “It is kind of unbelievable to think five years has gone by,” Kelly said in a telephone conference call with reporters on Thursday. “In some ways, it feels like it has been a long time.” Giffords interjected, “A long time.” Kelly continued. “And in many ways, it feels like it was yesterday.” “Like yesterday,” Giffords said. Though Giffords' right side is paralyzed, she continues to improve through intensive therapy, Kelly said. In November, she completed the 40-mile charity bike tour in Tucson, despite breaking a femur while training. Her goal this year, Kelly said, was to take up horseback riding. She had learned riding as a child and had competed, he said. The two were in Washington, D.C., and at the White House this week when President Barack Obama announced executive actions to strengthen background checks for gun purchasers. “Personally, for both Gabby and I, it was very satisfying to see all of this come together,” Kelly said. Daniel Hernandez, who was a Giffords intern at the time of the shooting, and who put pressure on her gunshot wound to stave off blood loss, said the Obama announcement brought some joy to survivors during a week that annually brings more grief than most. “It provided a small reprieve,” he said. “It allowed us to have this moment of odd celebration.” Hernandez, who stood behind Obama at the White House when he made his announcement, said the small steps Obama announced were not a panacea for gun violence but represented “a step in the right direction.” AZCENTRAL Arizonans take part in televised Obama gun control town-hall event Ken Dorushka, who took a bullet to the forearm while trying to keep his wife from being shot, said he was with other Tucson survivors recording an interview at a Tucson public-television station when Obama made his announcement. They watched it together. “It was wonderful to see some positive action has taken place after years of inaction,” Dorushka said. He said it was the opposite of the frustration he felt when Arizona’s Legislature, in the session following the 2011 shooting, voted to make the Colt .45 the official state gun. Former Rep. Ron Barber, who worked in Giffords' congressional office at the time of her shooting, remembered that he remained conscious after being shot outside the Safeway. He saw the rest of the shooting take place in front of him. Barber, who held Giffords' House seat for one term, said the political talk around the gun issue had hardened over the years. Barber has continued his mission of trying to improve the quality of political discourse. “If our leaders can’t show they can get along,” Barber said, “then the population won’t get the leadership it needs.” Maisch said the Tucson shooting has almost been lost in the wave of mass shootings around the country. Her phone used to ring after other mass shootings, with reporters wanting to get her reaction. ""They don’t call as much as they used to,” she said. “There’s too many.” On days like these, Maisch said, politicians often send their thoughts and prayers. “Thoughts and prayers are a pile of crap,” she said. “Action is what we need from them.” Maisch was in the Senate gallery in 2013 when lawmakers failed to pass a bill requiring background checks at gun shows. She shouted “shame on you” to senators and was escorted out by security. Maisch said on Friday that she was given a two-hour background check following that incident. “But they said no to a two-minute background check for an instrument of destruction,” she said. Maisch was the first to meet Teves, after the Aurora, Colo., shooting in 2012. Teves wanted to attend a town hall meeting with Sen. John McCain. Someone from the advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns put her in touch with Maisch and other Tucson survivors. Maisch drove up to attend the McCain town hall with her. At the town hall, Teves introduced herself, explained how her son was killed, and asked McCain, R-Ariz., to introduce a bill banning assault-style weapons. McCain, she said, told the crowd there was no political will for such a measure. Teves recalled some of the crowd cheered and whooped. Teves said she hears gun-rights advocates spin scenarios about what could have been done differently at the movie theater, speculating the incident might have ended more quickly if someone else had been armed, for example. Such speculation, while ignoring the fact the Aurora gunman wore full body armor, seems to dismiss Teves’ pain, she said. Teves recalled that hospital officials told her it would be best not to look at her son.

345,http://www.factcheck.org/2016/01/sorting-out-obamas-gun-proposal/,"By Robert Farley Posted on January 8, 2016 Politicians have offered confusing and conflicting information on guns in the wake of the San Bernardino shootings and President Obama’s announced plans for tighter gun controls:  In an emotion-filled speech on Jan. 5, President Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence. The most controversial was Obama’s plan to crack down on some unregulated Internet gun sales. The plan does not include any new regulations, or an executive order. Rather, Obama has directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to “clarify” that anyone “engaged in the business” of selling firearms — even if the seller operates over the Internet or at gun shows — must get a license and conduct background checks. In other words, Obama said, “It’s not where you do it, but what you do.” And, Obama warned, those who “engage in the business” of selling firearms via the Internet or at gun shows but do not obtain a license and subject buyers to background checks will be federally prosecuted. A person who “willfully engages in the business of dealing in firearms without the required license is subject to criminal prosecution and can be sentenced up to five years in prison and fined up to $250,000,” the White House warned. To back that up, Obama also announced that ATF has established an Internet Investigations Center that will track illegal online firearms trafficking, and Obama vowed that his 2017 budget proposal would include funding for an additional 200 ATF agents and investigators. Obama’s plan also includes the hiring of 230 additional FBI staff members to help to more efficiently and effectively perform background checks, and $500 million to improve mental health services. There has been some confusion about his proposals. For example, a number of our readers asked us to fact-check Obama’s claim that “some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.” Many of those readers correctly noted that federally licensed firearms dealers — no matter where they operate, including the Internet — are already required to perform background checks on the gun purchaser. And, besides, it’s illegal for a felon to purchase a gun, period. But that doesn’t mean Obama’s statement is wrong. Obama did not say violent felons are permitted to purchase guns over the Internet, only that some “can.” Obama was referring to those who buy guns from sellers who purport to be “private” sellers, not licensed dealers, and therefore are not required to perform background checks. According to current law, those “engaged in the business” of firearms dealing are required to be federally licensed, and must then subject buyers to background checks. But the law exempts any person “who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.” In moving to crackdown on Internet sales, Obama is acting on the belief that too many sellers engaged in the business of selling firearms are purporting to be private sellers in order to avoid the need to be licensed (and in turn be required to obtain background checks). That’s why, in an op-ed published by the New York Times on Jan. 8, Obama said the gun control steps he announced earlier in the week “include making sure that anybody engaged in the business of selling firearms conducts background checks.” The key phrase in that statement is “making sure.” Although Obama did not set a threshold number of sales to define who should be a licensed dealer, the White House noted that the “quantity and frequency of sales are relevant indicators.” The administration noted that “even a few transactions, when combined with other evidence, can be sufficient to establish that a person is ‘engaged in the business.’ For example, courts have upheld convictions for dealing without a license when as few as two firearms were sold or when only one or two transactions took place, when other factors also were present.” An Associated Press story said those other factors include business indicators such as “selling weapons in their original packaging and for a profit.” Some have cautioned that Obama’s actions will have little real effect on gun violence. Carlisle Moody, an economics professor at William & Mary, told us Obama’s proposals “will almost certainly have no effect on violent crime” because licensed firearms dealers who do business over the Internet already do background checks. The guns are mailed to a local licensed dealer who performs the background check. Existing law also requires that Internet sales between individuals in different states include background checks because guns cannot be legally mailed across state lines, per the Gun Control Act of 1968. In those cases, the gun is again mailed to a local licensed dealer. The only possibility of avoiding background checks via the Internet is for the two individuals to meet in person, Moody said. “This is a tiny subset of all gun sales. The number of face-to-face gun sales between individuals in which the purchaser is a violent felon who then uses the firearm in the commission of a crime is even smaller.” In addition, eight states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state — and Washington, D.C. — require background checks for all gun sales, even face-to-face private sales. Two other states — Maryland and Pennsylvania — have similar requirements for the purchase of handguns only. We should also note that it is illegal for a seller, private or licensed, to knowingly sell a firearm to someone who is prohibited from owning a gun, such as a convicted violent felon. But the seller would have to know. And as we said, in legitimate private sales, background checks are not required. Reacting to Obama’s announced gun actions, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush told ABC News that Obama’s plan would place an unnecessary burden on private sellers. But legitimate private sellers would not be required to do anything new. “If someone is selling a gun out of their collection, a one-off gun, they’re not a dealer, which would require a license and already requires that, you’re taking that person’s right away,” Bush said. “It doesn’t make sense to add burdens on people where the problem isn’t — you’re not solving whatever problem he’s trying to solve.” While Obama had the ATF clarify that a person engaged in the business of selling guns would need a license and to conduct background checks on buyers, regardless of where those sales take place, there is nothing in Obama’s actions that would affect the “one-off” gun seller that Bush describes. In order to affect the private seller, Congress would have to pass a universal background check law. A bipartisan 2013 amendment offered by Sens. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Republican, would have gotten closer to universal checks, though it would have allowed sales to family, friends and neighbors without the need for background checks. It failed in a 54-46 vote. In his speech on Jan. 5, Obama acknowledged that he could not institute universal background checks through executive order. “I want to be clear,” Obama said. “Congress still needs to act.” Unless or until Congress passes a universal background check law, the “one-off” sales described by Bush will still be exempt from the need for background checks. On the day that Obama made his speech, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio released an ad in which he says, “His [Obama’s] plan after the attack in San Bernardino? Take away our guns.”  In a Fox News interview the day after Obama’s speech, Republican front-runner Donald Trump criticized Obama’s plan and mischaracterized Hillary Clinton’s position on gun control, saying, “And you know, the Democrats generally, and Hillary Clinton is, I think worse than Obama on the issue, frankly. She wants to take everyone’s gun away.” We’ll deal with these two claims together, since they are related. Let’s start with Obama, who, in the speech outlining his plan, tried to get in front of such attacks. Obama, Jan. 5: Contrary to claims of some presidential candidates, apparently, before this meeting, this is not a plot to take away everybody’s guns. You pass a background check; you purchase a firearm. Nothing in Obama’s announced plan seeks to take away anyone’s gun. Nor would the plan prevent a law-abiding citizen from purchasing one. “I believe in the Second Amendment,” Obama said. “It’s there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this. I get it.” After Obama’s gun speech, Clinton told an Iowa crowd that she was “very proud” of the president’s announced actions. “I was pleased because some of what he’d called for, I’d advocated for a couple months ago in the debates and in the campaign,” Clinton said. The gun plan outlined by Clinton on her campaign website states that “any person attempting to sell a significant number of guns” over the Internet or at gun shows ought to be licensed and be required to get background checks from buyers. She also advocates “comprehensive federal background check legislation,” such as the Manchin-Toomey amendment. In addition, Clinton said she supports legislation barring the purchase of firearms by domestic abusers in dating relationships or convicted stalkers or by people involuntarily committed to outpatient mental health treatment. Finally, Clinton has called for an assault weapons ban, though she has not said that that would include confiscation of such weapons already owned by citizens. Pitching his proposal to expand the use of background checks during CNN’s “Guns In America” town hall on Jan. 7, Obama claimed that background checks were once advocated by none other than the National Rifle Association. Obama, Jan. 7: So why we should resist this [expanding background checks] — keep in mind that, historically, the NRA was in favor of background checks. That’s misleading. The president is misrepresenting the NRA’s actions during the creation of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. As we wrote in 2013, when Vice President Joe Biden made a similar claim, the NRA in 1991 was opposed to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which included a seven-day waiting period to allow law enforcement to conduct background checks on gun owners. In an essay on the history of the Brady law, Richard Aborn, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney and a board member of Handgun Control Inc., wrote that “the NRA tried a last-ditch effort” to block the Brady bill by working with Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska on an amendment to create an instant background check system. The bill failed to become law at that time. The Brady bill didn’t become law until 1993. At the time, the law required a five-day waiting period until an instant background check system could be developed. The NRA unsuccessfully pushed for a sunset provision that would have ended the five-day waiting period after five years, even if the instant check system wasn’t yet developed. Despite that setback, the NRA was successful in inserting language so that background checks applied only to federally licensed firearm dealers. An NRA lobbyist at the time described attempts to expand background checks to all gun sales as “foolish.” The NRA has been opposed to an expansion of background checks to any private sales ever since. For a fuller account of the historical context of the NRA’s position on background checks, see our story, “Biden Revises NRA History on Background Checks.” Q: Can employers, colleges and universities require COVID-19 vaccinations?

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. President outlines executive action on gun control With tears in his eyes, President Obama pulled out all the stops in pushing his new executive orders on gun control this week.  A Washington Post headline exclaimed, ""President Obama’s amazingly emotional speech on gun control.”  But the president also tried to appeal to people’s minds with a barrage of factual claims. Unfortunately, the president’s remarks had a large number of errors.  Here are 11 of the false or misleading claims that the president made. 1. “But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency. It doesn’t happen in other advanced countries. It’s not even close.” Last year, both France and the US had four mass public shootings.  France suffered more casualties (murders and injuries) from mass public shootings in 2015 than the US has suffered during Obama’s entire presidency (532 to 396).  And this occurred despite the US being five times more populous than France. But it isn’t just the horrific year that France had last year.  Far from being well below the frequency found in US, other European countries actually have a worse problem.  From 2009 through December 2015, eleven European countries experienced mass public shootings at a greater frequency than did the US, after adjusting for population.  These countries include Switzerland, Norway, Belgium, and the Czech Republic. President Obama’s statement is clearly false. 2. Five years ago this week, a sitting member of Congress and 18 others were shot at, at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona. It wasn’t the first time I had to talk to the nation in response to a mass shooting, nor would it be the last. Fort Hood. Binghamton. Aurora. Oak Creek. Newtown. The Navy Yard. Santa Barbara. Charleston. San Bernardino. . . . with common-sense gun safety measures we can reduce gun violence a whole lot more. . . .  Number one, anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks, or be subject to criminal prosecutions.” Obama claims that expanding background checks to include any private transfers of guns will reduce mass public shootings.  But he offers no evidence.  Not one mass public shooting during Obama’s administration would have prevented by these checks. Often overlooked is that the three most recent massacres occurred in states – California, Colorado, and Oregon – which already have such laws in place. The same is true of mass public shootings that have occurred in France, Belgium, Norway, Germany and other European countries. Examining all the mass public shootings in the US from 2000 through 2015, shows that states that adopted additional background checks on private transfers saw a statistically significant increase in rates of killings (80% higher) and injuries (101%) from mass public shootings. 3.“I believe in the Second Amendment. It’s there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms.” Here’s another quote: “I don’t believe people should be able to own guns.” That’s what Obama said to me when we were colleagues at the University of Chicago in 1996. Obama has also publicly supported a nationwide “ban [on] the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns” as well as a “ban the sale or transfer of all forms of semi-automatic weapons.”  Even as late as the 2008 Presidential primaries, Obama supported Washington, D.C.’s handgun ban. 4. “Contrary to the claims of what some gun rights proponents have suggested, this has not been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation.” It would be nice to take President Obama’s word for this, but Americans have seen this scenario play out before and at least realize this fear isn’t completely misplaced.  California, New York, and Chicago have all used registration lists to identify who owns guns that are no longer legal. Since 2004, the FBI has been required to destroy NICS records of gun sales and transfers within 24 hours of receipt.  However, federally licensed dealers are required to maintain records of background checks that have been done on customers.  Congress currently forbids federal collection of this information into a central database, but there’s no guarantee that this won’t change. With records on all private transfers and sales, the government could potentially figure out who legally owns a gun.  Five years down the line, a future President Hillary Clinton could push to require that federally licensed dealers make copies of their records and turn them into the federal government.  This would be the start of a national registration list. 5. “The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked. A recent study found that about one in 30 people looking to buy guns on one website had criminal records — one out of 30 had a criminal record. We’re talking about individuals convicted of serious crimes — aggravated assault, domestic violence, robbery, illegal gun possession. People with lengthy criminal histories buying deadly weapons all too easily.” This “internet loophole” is fictitious. If you try to buy a firearm over the Internet from a licensed firearms dealer, you have to go through a background check, period. They’ll ship the gun to your nearest licensed dealer. There’s no loophole there. If you buy on the Internet from a private seller in another state, they can’t just mail the gun to your doorstep.  The Gun Control Act of 1968 strictly regulates direct mailing of firearms across state lines, the only exception being for antiques.  Within state rules never provide different regulations for private gun sales on the Internet.  There is no Internet “loophole.” Obama’s 1-in-30 claim misstates what occurred.  Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown organization set up an internet site pretending to sell guns, but no guns were sold. Criminal background checks were done on the people’s names for those who visited the site and people who might have criminal backgrounds were identified, but there were all kinds of false positives.  I might not have a criminal record, but there are other people with similar names who do have criminal records. 6.“Congress actually voted to make it harder for public health experts to conduct research into gun violence; made it harder to collect data and facts and develop strategies to reduce gun violence.” This claim stems from another study funded by Michael Bloomberg.  In 1996, Congress passed a budget amendment that banned the CDC from using Federal funds to lobby for gun control.  Bloomberg claimed that firearms research in medical journals fell by 60 percent between 1996 and 2010.  But what Bloomberg measured was firearms research relative to all other research.  In fact, total research on firearms increased over that time.  Firearm studies soared from 69 in 1996 to 121 in 2013. Other medical journal research simply increased even much faster. 7. ""After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40 percent. Forty percent.” There are 18 states with background checks on the private transfers of guns. The Bloomberg funded study picked the state that most serves their agenda here. But a great deal of manipulation was still required.  To get the 40% figure, 1995 to 2005 is conveniently selected as the time period.Adding one more year to the data completely undermines Obama’s claims.  Connecticut’s firearm homicide rate only fell by 16% between 1995 and 2006.  It fell by 12.5% between 1995 and 2010. Meanwhile, the US and the rest of the Northeast experienced much greater drops.  From 1995 to 2006, the firearm homicide rates for the US and the rest of the Northeast fell by 27% and 22%, respectively.  From 1995 to 2010, these drops were even more pronounced – 39% and 31%.  Therefore, when one looks at these longer time periods, one actually observes a relative increase in Connecticut’s firearm homicide rate. 8. ""since Missouri repealed a law requiring comprehensive background checks and purchase permits, gun deaths have increased to almost 50 percent higher than the national average.” This is yet another Bloomberg funded study.  Again, another it picked out one state out of many that have these laws. After the law was changed, Missouri’s murder rates did in fact rise by 17 percent relative to the rest of the US. However, murder rates were already on a sharp, upward trend, having increased by 32 percent in the five years prior to the change.  The murder rate increase thus actually slowed down after the background checks on private transfers were ended. Also, there was no relative fall in Missouri’s murder rate after the state adopted comprehensive background checks in 1981. 9. ""there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence and save more lives.” Despite Obama’s claims, the law is actually quite clear on those who have to get a federal firearms license and it poses real problems for his plans: “a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.”  Yet, Obama’s rules will cover people who sell as few as one gun.  How one reconciles that with the language of the statute is a mystery.  For many individuals, even a couple of dozen gun sales are unlikely to be an individual’s primary occupation. 10.                         -- “We know we can’t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence. Some of you may recall at the same time that Sandy Hook happened, a disturbed person in China took a knife and tried to kill — with a knife — a bunch of children in China, but most of them survived because he didn’t have access to a powerful weapon.” Guns are more effective weapons, but that also means that they are more effective tools for self-defense.  In any case, it is fortunately as President Obama says that “most of [the victims] survived” in the attack that he chose to mention, but, over the years, there have been lots of very deadly knife attacks in China. 11.“Just as with more research, we’ve reduced traffic fatalities enormously over the last 30 years. . . . Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen or misused or discharged accidentally. . . . We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer. . . . we’re going to work with the private sector to update firearms technology. . . . a product that now kills almost as many Americans as car accidents. . . .” The claim that government safety regulations has made cars safer – either in reducing accidents or suicides -- and could similarly be used to make guns safer is wrong.   Between 2000 and 2013, without any of the regulations that Obama claims are necessary, the drop in accidental firearm deaths fell almost twice as much as the drop in accidental motor vehicle deaths.  While firearm suicides rose by 28 percent over that period, suicides using motor vehicles rose by 47 percent. The real problem with Mr. Obama’s policies is that they will actually cost lives.  Possibly President Obama has seen too many James Bond movies, but requiring the technology that limit who can use a gun is extremely expensive and is hardly fool proof. The one gun on the market right now works with a watch like wrist ban that sends out a short-range radio signal that needs to be near the gun for it to fire costs $1,800.  Police won’t use the guns because radio-jamming devices can effectively disarm the police.  The high cost will prevent poor people from having the option to defend themselves.

	Alyssa Sage Staff Writer Elizabeth Banks, Bradley Cooper, Will Ferrell, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Rashida Jones and Paul Rudd are just seven of the nearly 100 high-profile figures to sign a letter of support addressed to President Obama, publicizing their endorsement for his Monday decision to take executive action against gun violence. The effort is sponsored by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Organizers are urging supporters to support #enough on social media and to ask celebrities at the Golden Globes for their thoughts on gun violence. The letter begins by thanking Obama for his courageous actions against gun violence, recalling recent mass shooting incidents and reciting gun violence statistics.  “Like you, and like most Americans, we have had ENOUGH,” the letter declares. “We have had enough of seeing unthinkable tragedies happen and nothing being done. This level of depravity should rattle anyone with a conscience.” It continues by again praising Obama for his recent efforts and calling on the members of Congress “who failed to act on the gun violence epidemic” to take similar action. “Thank you for beginning to end this national disgrace and show your fellow citizens and the rest of the world that the United States of America does indeed stand for the principles on which it was founded,” the letter concludes. Additional celeb signees include Mark Ruffalo, Kristen Wiig, Sophia Bush, Nick Cannon, Liam Neeson, Tobey Maguire, Sarah Jessica Parker, Julianne Moore, Tom McCarthy and Olivia Wilde.

351,http://time.com/4168056/obama-gun-control-speech-transcript/?iid=sr-link2,"President Barack Obama unveiled a new set of executive actions aimed at limiting gun violence in a press conference Tuesday from the White House. The efforts largely center on more stringent background checks. Here’s a full transcript of his remarks. THE PRESIDENT: Mark, I want to thank you for your introduction. I still remember the first time we met, the time we spent together, and the conversation we had about Daniel. And that changed me that day. And my hope, earnestly, has been that it would change the country. Five years ago this week, a sitting member of Congress and 18 others were shot at, at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona. It wasn’t the first time I had to talk to the nation in response to a mass shooting, nor would it be the last. Fort Hood. Binghamton. Aurora. Oak Creek. Newtown. The Navy Yard. Santa Barbara. Charleston. San Bernardino. Too many. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Too many. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Too many. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Too many. THE PRESIDENT: Thanks to a great medical team and the love of her husband, Mark, my dear friend and colleague, Gabby Giffords, survived. She’s here with us today, with her wonderful mom. (Applause.) Thanks to a great medical team, her wonderful husband, Mark — who, by the way, the last time I met with Mark — this is just a small aside — you may know Mark’s twin brother is in outer space. (Laughter.) He came to the office, and I said, how often are you talking to him? And he says, well, I usually talk to him every day, but the call was coming in right before the meeting so I think I may have not answered his call — (laughter) — which made me feel kind of bad. (Laughter.) That’s a long-distance call. (Laughter.) So I told him if his brother, Scott, is calling today, that he should take it. (Laughter.) Turn the ringer on. (Laughter.) I was there with Gabby when she was still in the hospital, and we didn’t think necessarily at that point that she was going to survive. And that visit right before a memorial — about an hour later Gabby first opened her eyes. And I remember talking to mom about that. But I know the pain that she and her family have endured these past five years, and the rehabilitation and the work and the effort to recover from shattering injuries. And then I think of all the Americans who aren’t as fortunate. Every single year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns — 30,000. Suicides. Domestic violence. Gang shootouts. Accidents. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost brothers and sisters, or buried their own children. Many have had to learn to live with a disability, or learned to live without the love of their life. A number of those people are here today. They can tell you some stories. In this room right here, there are a lot of stories. There’s a lot of heartache. There’s a lot of resilience, there’s a lot of strength, but there’s also a lot of pain. And this is just a small sample. The United States of America is not the only country on Earth with violent or dangerous people. We are not inherently more prone to violence. But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency. It doesn’t happen in other advanced countries. It’s not even close. And as I’ve said before, somehow we’ve become numb to it and we start thinking that this is normal. And instead of thinking about how to solve the problem, this has become one of our most polarized, partisan debates — despite the fact that there’s a general consensus in America about what needs to be done. That’s part of the reason why, on Thursday, I’m going to hold a town hall meeting in Virginia on gun violence. Because my goal here is to bring good people on both sides of this issue together for an open discussion. I’m not on the ballot again. I’m not looking to score some points. I think we can disagree without impugning other people’s motives or without being disagreeable. We don’t need to be talking past one another. But we do have to feel a sense of urgency about it. In Dr. King’s words, we need to feel the “fierce urgency of now.” Because people are dying. And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do, no longer suffice. That’s why we’re here today. Not to debate the last mass shooting, but to do something to try to prevent the next one. (Applause.) To prove that the vast majority of Americans, even if our voices aren’t always the loudest or most extreme, care enough about a little boy like Daniel to come together and take common-sense steps to save lives and protect more of our children. Now, I want to be absolutely clear at the start — and I’ve said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do — I believe in the Second Amendment. It’s there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this — (applause) — I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment. I mean, think about it. We all believe in the First Amendment, the guarantee of free speech, but we accept that you can’t yell “fire” in a theater. We understand there are some constraints on our freedom in order to protect innocent people. We cherish our right to privacy, but we accept that you have to go through metal detectors before being allowed to board a plane. It’s not because people like doing that, but we understand that that’s part of the price of living in a civilized society. And what’s often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners actually agree. A majority of gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking feud from inflicting harm on a massive scale. Today, background checks are required at gun stores. If a father wants to teach his daughter how to hunt, he can walk into a gun store, get a background check, purchase his weapon safely and responsibly. This is not seen as an infringement on the Second Amendment. Contrary to the claims of what some gun rights proponents have suggested, this hasn’t been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation. Contrary to claims of some presidential candidates, apparently, before this meeting, this is not a plot to take away everybody’s guns. You pass a background check; you purchase a firearm. The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked. A recent study found that about one in 30 people looking to buy guns on one website had criminal records — one out of 30 had a criminal record. We’re talking about individuals convicted of serious crimes — aggravated assault, domestic violence, robbery, illegal gun possession. People with lengthy criminal histories buying deadly weapons all too easily. And this was just one website within the span of a few months. So we’ve created a system in which dangerous people are allowed to play by a different set of rules than a responsible gun owner who buys his or her gun the right way and subjects themselves to a background check. That doesn’t make sense. Everybody should have to abide by the same rules. Most Americans and gun owners agree. And that’s what we tried to change three years ago, after 26 Americans -– including 20 children -– were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary. Two United States Senators -– Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, both gun owners, both strong defenders of our Second Amendment rights, both with “A” grades from the NRA –- that’s hard to get — worked together in good faith, consulting with folks like our Vice President, who has been a champion on this for a long time, to write a common-sense compromise bill that would have required virtually everyone who buys a gun to get a background check. That was it. Pretty common-sense stuff. Ninety percent of Americans supported that idea. Ninety percent of Democrats in the Senate voted for that idea. But it failed because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate voted against that idea. How did this become such a partisan issue? Republican President George W. Bush once said, “I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don’t get into the hands of people that shouldn’t have them.” Senator John McCain introduced a bipartisan measure to address the gun show loophole, saying, “We need this amendment because criminals and terrorists have exploited and are exploiting this very obvious loophole in our gun safety laws.” Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. And by the way, most of its members still do. Most Republican voters still do. How did we get here? How did we get to the place where people think requiring a comprehensive background check means taking away people’s guns? Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying. I reject that thinking. (Applause.) We know we can’t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence. Some of you may recall, at the same time that Sandy Hook happened, a disturbed person in China took a knife and tried to kill — with a knife — a bunch of children in China. But most of them survived because he didn’t have access to a powerful weapon. We maybe can’t save everybody, but we could save some. Just as we don’t prevent all traffic accidents but we take steps to try to reduce traffic accidents. As Ronald Reagan once said, if mandatory background checks could save more lives, “it would be well worth making it the law of the land.” The bill before Congress three years ago met that test. Unfortunately, too many senators failed theirs. (Applause.) In fact, we know that background checks make a difference. After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40 percent — 40 percent. (Applause.) Meanwhile, since Missouri repealed a law requiring comprehensive background checks and purchase permits, gun deaths have increased to almost 50 percent higher than the national average. One study found, unsurprisingly, that criminals in Missouri now have easier access to guns. And the evidence tells us that in states that require background checks, law-abiding Americans don’t find it any harder to purchase guns whatsoever. Their guns have not been confiscated. Their rights have not been infringed. And that’s just the information we have access to. With more research, we could further improve gun safety. Just as with more research, we’ve reduced traffic fatalities enormously over the last 30 years. We do research when cars, food, medicine, even toys harm people so that we make them safer. And you know what — research, science — those are good things. They work. (Laughter and applause.) They do. But think about this. When it comes to an inherently deadly weapon — nobody argues that guns are potentially deadly — weapons that kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, Congress actually voted to make it harder for public health experts to conduct research into gun violence; made it harder to collect data and facts and develop strategies to reduce gun violence. Even after San Bernardino, they’ve refused to make it harder for terror suspects who can’t get on a plane to buy semi-automatic weapons. That’s not right. That can’t be right. So the gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they cannot hold America hostage. (Applause.) We do not have to accept this carnage as the price of freedom. (Applause.) Now, I want to be clear. Congress still needs to act. The folks in this room will not rest until Congress does. (Applause.) Because once Congress gets on board with common-sense gun safety measures we can reduce gun violence a whole lot more. But we also can’t wait. Until we have a Congress that’s in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence and save more lives -– actions that protect our rights and our kids. After Sandy Hook, Joe and I worked together with our teams and we put forward a whole series of executive actions to try to tighten up the existing rules and systems that we had in place. But today, we want to take it a step further. So let me outline what we’re going to be doing. Number one, anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks, or be subject to criminal prosecutions. (Applause.) It doesn’t matter whether you’re doing it over the Internet or at a gun show. It’s not where you do it, but what you do. We’re also expanding background checks to cover violent criminals who try to buy some of the most dangerous firearms by hiding behind trusts and corporations and various cutouts. We’re also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient. Under the guidance of Jim Comey and the FBI, our Deputy Director Tom Brandon at ATF, we’re going to hire more folks to process applications faster, and we’re going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century. (Applause.) And these steps will actually lead to a smoother process for law-abiding gun owners, a smoother process for responsible gun dealers, a stronger process for protecting the people from — the public from dangerous people. So that’s number one. Number two, we’re going to do everything we can to ensure the smart and effective enforcement of gun safety laws that are already on the books, which means we’re going to add 200 more ATF agents and investigators. We’re going to require firearms dealers to report more lost or stolen guns on a timely basis. We’re working with advocates to protect victims of domestic abuse from gun violence, where too often — (applause) — where too often, people are not getting the protection that they need. Number three, we’re going to do more to help those suffering from mental illness get the help that they need. (Applause.) High-profile mass shootings tend to shine a light on those few mentally unstable people who inflict harm on others. But the truth is, is that nearly two in three gun deaths are from suicides. So a lot of our work is to prevent people from hurting themselves. That’s why we made sure that the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — (laughter and applause) — that law made sure that treatment for mental health was covered the same as treatment for any other illness. And that’s why we’re going to invest $500 million to expand access to treatment across the country. (Applause.) It’s also why we’re going to ensure that federal mental health records are submitted to the background check system, and remove barriers that prevent states from reporting relevant information. If we can continue to de-stigmatize mental health issues, get folks proper care, and fill gaps in the background check system, then we can spare more families the pain of losing a loved one to suicide. And for those in Congress who so often rush to blame mental illness for mass shootings as a way of avoiding action on guns, here’s your chance to support these efforts. Put your money where your mouth is. (Applause.) Number four, we’re going to boost gun safety technology. Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen or misused or discharged accidentally. In 2013 alone, more than 500 people lost their lives to gun accidents –- and that includes 30 children younger than five years old. In the greatest, most technologically advanced nation on Earth, there is no reason for this. We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer. If we can set it up so you can’t unlock your phone unless you’ve got the right fingerprint, why can’t we do the same thing for our guns? (Applause.) If there’s an app that can help us find a missing tablet — which happens to me often the older I get — (laughter) — if we can do it for your iPad, there’s no reason we can’t do it with a stolen gun. If a child can’t open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure that they can’t pull a trigger on a gun. (Applause.) Right? So we’re going to advance research. We’re going to work with the private sector to update firearms technology. And some gun retailers are already stepping up by refusing to finalize a purchase without a complete background check, or by refraining from selling semi-automatic weapons or high-capacity magazines. And I hope that more retailers and more manufacturers join them — because they should care as much as anybody about a product that now kills almost as many Americans as car accidents. I make this point because none of us can do this alone. I think Mark made that point earlier. All of us should be able to work together to find a balance that declares the rest of our rights are also important — Second Amendment rights are important, but there are other rights that we care about as well. And we have to be able to balance them. Because our right to worship freely and safely –- that right was denied to Christians in Charleston, South Carolina. (Applause.) And that was denied Jews in Kansas City. And that was denied Muslims in Chapel Hill, and Sikhs in Oak Creek. (Applause.) They had rights, too. (Applause.) Our right to peaceful assembly -– that right was robbed from moviegoers in Aurora and Lafayette. Our unalienable right to life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness -– those rights were stripped from college students in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara, and from high schoolers at Columbine, and from first-graders in Newtown. First-graders. And from every family who never imagined that their loved one would be taken from our lives by a bullet from a gun. Every time I think about those kids it gets me mad. And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day. (Applause.) So all of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby’s lies. All of us need to stand up and protect its citizens. All of us need to demand governors and legislatures and businesses do their part to make our communities safer. We need the wide majority of responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time this happens and feel like your views are not being properly represented to join with us to demand something better. (Applause.) And we need voters who want safer gun laws, and who are disappointed in leaders who stand in their way, to remember come election time. (Applause.) I mean, some of this is just simple math. Yes, the gun lobby is loud and it is organized in defense of making it effortless for guns to be available for anybody, any time. Well, you know what, the rest of us, we all have to be just as passionate. We have to be just as organized in defense of our kids. This is not that complicated. The reason Congress blocks laws is because they want to win elections. And if you make it hard for them to win an election if they block those laws, they’ll change course, I promise you. (Applause.) And, yes, it will be hard, and it won’t happen overnight. It won’t happen during this Congress. It won’t happen during my presidency. But a lot of things don’t happen overnight. A woman’s right to vote didn’t happen overnight. The liberation of African Americans didn’t happen overnight. LGBT rights — that was decades’ worth of work. So just because it’s hard, that’s no excuse not to try. And if you have any doubt as to why you should feel that “fierce urgency of now,” think about what happened three weeks ago. Zaevion Dobson was a sophomore at Fulton High School in Knoxville, Tennessee. He played football; beloved by his classmates and his teachers. His own mayor called him one of their city’s success stories. The week before Christmas, he headed to a friend’s house to play video games. He wasn’t in the wrong place at the wrong time. He hadn’t made a bad decision. He was exactly where any other kid would be. Your kid. My kids. And then gunmen started firing. And Zaevion — who was in high school, hadn’t even gotten started in life — dove on top of three girls to shield them from the bullets. And he was shot in the head. And the girls were spared. He gave his life to save theirs –- an act of heroism a lot bigger than anything we should ever expect from a 15-year-old. “Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends.” We are not asked to do what Zaevion Dobson did. We’re not asked to have shoulders that big; a heart that strong; reactions that quick. I’m not asking people to have that same level of courage, or sacrifice, or love. But if we love our kids and care about their prospects, and if we love this country and care about its future, then we can find the courage to vote. We can find the courage to get mobilized and organized. We can find the courage to cut through all the noise and do what a sensible country would do. That’s what we’re doing today. And tomorrow, we should do more. And we should do more the day after that. And if we do, we’ll leave behind a nation that’s stronger than the one we inherited and worthy of the sacrifice of a young man like Zaevion. (Applause.) Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you. God bless America. (Applause.) Contact us at letters@time.com.",2016-01-15 00:00:00,Transcript: Read Barack Obama's Speech on New Gun Control Measures,,4419,http://time.com
352,http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-gun-violence-meets-ideology,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Evan Osnos San Bernardino is No. 13—the thirteenth mass public shooting in the United States in the past week. Most of the others—in Boston, Houston, Sacramento—haven’t received much national news attention, because Americans are still absorbing the horror of what happened last week, when, on the day after Thanksgiving, a man named Robert Lewis Dear, Jr., was arrested after going on a rampage at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, killing three people and injuring nine others. It’s too soon to know what led to the killings in San Bernardino, but it’s a strange fiction to pretend, as we often do, that we have yet to understand what led us to this broader moment. Some of the reasons are in plain sight, and have been for decades. In the early nineteen-eighties, Louis Beam was an active but frustrated leader of the radical American right-wing fringe. He had previously been arrested in Houston, in connection with the bombing of a liberal Pacifica radio station and the machine-gunning of a Communist Party office. (The charges were dropped.) By 1983, Beam had concluded that hierarchical far-right groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan, were doomed to be marginalized or shut down by criminal and civil litigation, and he proposed a different strategy: in an essay called “Leaderless Resistance,” he advocated a turn toward “very small or even one man cells of resistance.” He borrowed the idea from Colonel Ulius Louis Amoss, a U.S. intelligence officer who suggested, in the early sixties, that C.I.A.-backed operations in Europe would be less prone to disruption if they were structured as small or individual units, called “phantom cells.” Beam popularized the concept through his writings in the eighties and nineties, and “leaderless resistance” was embraced by a vast range of movements, including animal-liberation activists, tax protesters, radical Islamists, and anti-abortion extremists. Over the years, the F.B.I. and security analysts have come to describe the phenomenon as a “lone wolf” problem—individual extremists or small groups of attackers operating with little coördination. It extended from Timothy McVeigh, in Oklahoma City, to Dylann Roof, who murdered nine parishioners at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The designation of “lone wolf” has always been controversial; some believe that it glamorizes murderers, and, worse, some security specialists worry that it can obscure the importance of understanding the underlying pathways that lead up to these moments. After Dear was arrested at the Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs, he reportedly told investigators, “No more baby parts.” In the days after the attack, a portrait emerged of a man who had been repeatedly arrested for domestic and sexual abuse and other crimes. The Times quoted a source who recalled Dear hailing members of the Army of God, a loose network of anti-abortion extremists that has conducted killings and bombings, as “heroes.” On Wednesday, as I wrote this, Americans were presented with another horrific scene. This time, in San Bernardino, California, gunmen stormed a service center for the disabled, killing at least fourteen people and wounding at least seventeen others. The police were searching for as many as three gunmen, who fled in an S.U.V. Without knowing much more than the death before him, Chief Jarrod Burguan, of the San Bernardino Police Department, called the event a “domestic-terrorism-type situation.” Week by week, or, recently, hour by hour, we tally the carnage. In a study last year, scholars at the Harvard School of Public Health found that, between 1982 and 2011, public mass shootings—a definition intended to exclude domestic and gang-related violence—occurred every two hundred days. Since September, 2011, this interval has sunk by more than two-thirds, to sixty-four days. Using a broader definition (shootings, not fatalities), there has been more than one mass shooting every day this year, including the other twelve in the past week. In the period since Islamic State militants attacked Paris, on November 13th, Republican Presidential candidates have raced to declare that America must defend itself, above all, from foreign terrorists. The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump, called for “surveillance of certain mosques.” Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, said, “There is no greater risk to our security than radical Islamic terrorists.” Law-enforcement statistics, and practitioners, tell a different story. In the years since the 9/11 attacks, the United States has suffered sixty-five assaults associated with right-wing ideologies—“sovereign citizens,” white supremacists, and anti-abortion extremists—and twenty-four by Muslim extremists, according to an analysis based on data from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, at the University of Maryland.* You might think that this underrepresents the risk of a spectacular, high-casualty attack, but, as my colleague John Cassidy has written, the security officials who protect the public against both domestic and foreign terrorists say the domestic risk is greater. The terrorism experts Charles Kurzman, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and David Schanzer, of Duke, surveyed nearly four hundred state and local police agencies, and found that the “main terrorist threat in the United States is not from violent Muslim extremists but from right-wing extremists.” Moreover, domestic terrorism by America’s violent far right has been growing. In a 2012 study, Arie Perliger, a terrorism specialist at the U.S. Military Academy, wrote, “In the last few years, and especially since 2007, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of attacks and violent plots originating from individuals and groups who self-identify with the far right of American politics.” The explanations are varied and, by their nature, sketchy—a sense of desperation; a pattern of contagious, ritualized attacks; the specific rage inspired among bigots by two terms under America’s first black President. After Dear was arrested in connection with the Planned Parenthood attack, some of the most zealous critics of the organization rejected any suggestion that his actions might have had anything to do with a series of deceptively edited videos from the Center for Medical Progress which accuse Planned Parenthood of selling fetal tissue for profit. Carly Fiorina, the Presidential candidate who has promoted the videos most ardently, said that it was “typical left-wing tactics” to connect the attacks to the political climate around abortion. It will take time to discover what mix of ideas and madness contributed to the attacks in Colorado Springs and San Bernardino. But it is a different kind of madness to pretend that we’ve learned nothing about why these types of events happen. In a study published this year in the journal American Behavioral Scientist, Mark Pitcavage, of the Anti-Defamation League, examined thirty-five “lone wolf” attackers—their tactics and ideas, and the consequences of their actions. He found that “ideology seems to have played a substantial role in the majority of the violent acts.” Nearly two-thirds of the attackers had a clear sense of what they were doing to their “perceived enemies,” and why. _* This sentence has been revised to clarify the source of the law-enforcement statistics. _ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Judge Napolitano gives insight on plan being protested by GOP candidates on 'America's Newsroom' President Obama vowed Monday to press ahead with new executive actions on gun control after meeting with top law enforcement officials, claiming he has the “legal authority” to act – and defying congressional critics who say he’s pursuing a “dangerous” overreach. The president, without giving any specifics, said he’ll be “rolling out these initiatives” over the next several days. He spoke after meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey and other top officials to review their proposals and finalize his plans. Obama said their recommendations are “well within my legal authority” and would be supported by “the overwhelming majority of the American people including gun owners.” “The recommendations that are being made by my team here are ones that are entirely consistent with the Second Amendment,” Obama said, claiming they could “potentially save lives.” The White House said that Obama will deliver remarks from the East Room at 11:40 a.m. Tuesday announcing a series of executive actions on gun control. The revived push to tighten America’s gun laws via executive action, however, has resulted in a backlash on Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. Republicans made clear they would fight the administration and accused the president of overstepping. ""While we don’t yet know the details of the plan, the president is at minimum subverting the legislative branch, and potentially overturning its will,” House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement. “This is a dangerous level of executive overreach, and the country will not stand for it.” Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, who chairs a key appropriations panel, warned Lynch on Monday that he would “use every tool at my disposal to immediately restrict” DOJ funding if the department proceeds with “new restrictions on our Constitutional rights.” Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump vowed to reverse any such actions if he’s elected. ""We're not changing the Second Amendment,"" Trump said Saturday at a campaign rally in Biloxi, Miss. ""I will veto that. I will un-sign that so fast."" While Obama did not detail the proposals, a priority is an effort to expand background checks on gun sales by forcing more sellers to register as federally licensed gun dealers. The changes would be aimed at some unregistered sellers who skirt the background check laws by selling at gun shows, online or informal settings. Other moves being considered include improving reporting of lost and stolen weapons and beefing up inspections of licensed dealers, according to a person familiar with the plans. The package includes measures this White House has long considered but not completed, mindful of the legal fight sure to follow as well as the potential for political backlash for some fellow Democrats. While Obama took heat from Republicans, supporters of stronger action on gun control applauded the president’s new push. ""We definitely think there are things he can do,"" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for expanding background checks. Gross says his recent conversations with White House aides have left him hopeful. ""It's very clear that the White House is feeling emboldened,"" he said. Obama announced the meeting with Lynch in his weekly address from his Hawaii holiday vacation. On Thursday, he'll take his argument to prime time, participating in a town hall discussion of gun violence on CNN. He's slated to make his case for changes in his State of the Union address on Jan. 12. The high-profile rollout reflects a White House continuing to look for ways to wrap up unfinished business, despite an uncooperative Congress. After all but ignoring the issue in his first term, Obama changed course after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012. Nevertheless, the president failed to push a package of gun measures through Congress, including one expanding background checks. At the same time, Obama took nearly two dozen executive actions to tighten gun laws, but left a major expansion of background checks out of the mix. But after the shooting at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon in October, Obama ordered his staff to redouble the effort to look for ways to work around Congress. Under current law, federally licensed firearms dealers are required to seek background checks on potential firearm purchasers. But advocacy groups say many sellers are currently exempt from having to register, increasing the chance of sales to customers prohibited by law from purchasing a gun. The administration is expected to reclassify some of those dealers using a mix of criteria, such as the number and frequency of guns sold, whether sellers profit off sales, whether they advertise, rent space or tables at gun shows and pay taxes.

During this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) argued if Democrats were going to proceed by operating on the claim former President Donald Trump incite violence on Capitol Hill, then the standard should be applied to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Reps. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) as well. While lawmakers on Capitol Hill were hammering out a deal on COVID-19 relief before Congress recessed for Christmas, Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) took to the airwaves to offer an update on the progress being made. On this week’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) urged his Democrat colleagues to allow for a “respectful process” for the confirmation of Supreme Court associate justice appointee Amy Coney Barrett. In an appearance on this week’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) vowed the U.S. Senate would “move forward without delay” on seeking a replacement for Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In an interview set to air on this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” President Donald Trump rejected the possibility of a national mask mandate. During an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison was asked if black people in Minneapolis had reason to fear and distrust their local enforcement by show host Chris Wallace. During a “Fox News Sunday” interview, billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban continued to openly flirt with the idea of running for president. During an appearance with Fox News on Sunday, Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz responded to criticism that the lack of witnesses in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial put a “taint” on what is likely to be an acquittal. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, under questioning by Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace, quashed the alleged notion that the Democrats’ impeachment efforts have weakened American President Donald Trump across the world. On this week’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper defended the Trump administration’s decision not to fully cooperate with Congress on its impeachment push. Esper told host Chris Wallace he saw Congress as having oversight authority, but it During an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove weighed in on impeachment and the controversy over a whistleblower complaint that President Donald Trump urged Ukraine’s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Rove said On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said the administration would not allow liberals and socialists to use recent gun violence as an excuse to “confiscate firearms” from law-abiding citizens. “The president has been During an appearance on this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka explained why his organization is in opposition to the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which he argued was comprised of unenforceable components regarding Mexico. During an interview with “Fox News Sunday,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow shot down the rumors of a potential recession on the horizon. According to Kudlow, the United States economy is “in pretty good shape.” “Well, first of all, White House senior adviser and speechwriter Stephen Miller told Fox News Sunday that left-wing Democrats were not merely criticizing the U.S. to improve it, but rather hoping to turn it into a socialist country like Venezuela. Stephen Miller, senior adviser and speechwriter for President Donald Trump, called out Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) Sunday for comparing facilities at the southern border with “concentration camps.” Montana Gov. and Democrat presidential hopeful Steve Bullock says it is time to view guns as a “public health issue.” On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) reacted to what he called Iran “marching up the escalation chain,” which includes interference with international shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf and the downing of an unmanned On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan called on Congress to change asylum laws to allow for the detention of migrants while their claims are processed. “We need three specific changes in During an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) discussed why he is one of the few Democrats that has not called for President Donald Trump’s impeachment despite believing there was collusion between the During an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) slammed Democrats for seemingly not caring if the FBI and Department of Justice defrauded the FISA court. Graham said he wished one Democrat would get behind getting more information On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Trump economic advisor Larry Kudlow argued that the tariffs the United States is set to levy on China were worth the risk, especially given the past two decades of what he called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s former chief of staff Josh Holmes, still a top ally of the Kentucky Senator, ripped a rogue subpoena from Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC). On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” veteran journalist Bob Woodward acknowledged the extraordinary role the dossier manufactured by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. Woodward to host Chris Wallace the use of the Steele dossier warranted an investigation. “The Fake News Media is working overtime to blame me for the horrible attack in New Zealand,” he wrote. “They will have to work very hard to prove that one. So Ridiculous!” “You need forest management. It has to be,” Trump said. “I’m not saying that in a negative way, a positive — I’m just saying the facts.” Protect Yourself From Big Tech! Thank You!

          / CBS News President Obama will participate in a live town hall on reducing gun violence in the U.S., according to a White House official. On Thursday evening, from 8pm-9pm ET, Mr. Obama will join CNN's Anderson Cooper for a town hall in northern Virginia, at George Mason University. Cooper will be moderating the discussion, the official said, and the president will answer questions from the audience. Earlier in the week, on Monday, the president will be meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to discuss options on executive measures aimed at reducing gun violence. For several months, since the mass shooting at an Oregon community college, White House and Justice Department lawyers have, under the president's direction, been reviewing measures the president can take unilaterally, combing the law to see if any unused administrative authority is available to him. President Obama said in July that he has been ""most frustrated and most stymied"" by the country's inability to enact ""sufficient, common sense gun safety laws.""

362,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/18/obamas-guns-gambit,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Margaret Talbot Last week at the White House, as President Obama announced a set of executive actions aimed at blunting gun violence, he seemed anything but numb. He wept as he invoked the first graders killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut—a response for which some gun advocates mocked him. He quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.,’s words about the “fierce urgency of now.” But he also acknowledged the numbness that can overcome people in the face of one mass shooting after another. That numbness puts proponents of unfettered gun rights at an advantage. People can easily start thinking of gun violence as something native to America’s angry, intractable soul—the armed, anti-federalist takeover of wildlife-refuge buildings in Oregon this month seemed like proof. And when, time and again, Congress thwarts gun reforms that are supported by majorities of Americans it can be hard to imagine that the status quo will ever change. If we couldn’t do anything after Sandy Hook—Congress chose at that time to reject comprehensive background checks—when could we? If, after the San Bernardino shooting, in December, Congress couldn’t agree to restrict gun ownership for people on the terror watch list, how could we enact anything even slightly more ambitious? That’s why the President’s executive actions are important. Even though they are modest—focussed on making background checks that are already required more efficient, and on narrowing the loophole that allows unlicensed individuals to sell firearms (often online or at gun shows) without conducting any background checks on buyers—they show that something other than weary capitulation to the gun lobby is still possible. If numbness benefits gun-rights absolutists, uninformed numbness might serve them even better. In 1993, The New England Journal of Medicine published a study showing that “keeping a gun in the home was strongly and independently associated with an increased risk of homicide” in that home. The researchers had been funded by the C.D.C.’s National Center for Injury Prevention, and the N.R.A. responded by trying to get the prevention center defunded. It didn’t succeed, but, in 1996, Congress amended an appropriations bill to the effect that “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.” It was a little like saying that no research on the health effects of smoking should be interpretable as anti-smoking. Congress also removed $2.6 million from the C.D.C.’s budget—the precise amount that had gone to the prevention center’s research—and then restored it, earmarked for an entirely different purpose. As a result, one of the study’s authors said in a public-radio interview last spring, “many, many people stopped doing gun research.” Jay Dickey, the Republican representative and N.R.A. member from Arkansas who sponsored the amendment, came to regret it. Dismayed by the continuing toll of gun violence, he was eventually persuaded that firearm deaths could be reduced without violating the Second Amendment. He now believes that research on gun violence can help prevent it, much as similar work on highway safety resulted in innovations like seat belts, air bags, highway dividers, and minimum drinking ages, and prevented hundreds of thousands of traffic deaths. In December, in a letter to Mike Thompson, the chairman of the House Democrats’ Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Dickey wrote, “Research could have been continued on gun violence without infringing on the rights of gun owners, in the same fashion that the highway industry continued its research without eliminating the automobile.” He added, “We should slowly but methodically fund such research until a solution is reached. Doing nothing is no longer an acceptable solution.” Thousands of doctors and scientists have called for ending the research freeze. Obama tried to do so in 2013, and he brought up the subject again on Thursday night, at a town-hall meeting in Fairfax, Virginia, where he mentioned smart-gun technology and noted how research had led to safety improvements in cars, toys, and medicines. “The notion that we would not apply the same basic principles to gun ownership as we do to everything else that we own,” he said, “contradicts what we do to try to create a better life for Americans.” So far, it’s all been to no avail. Indeed, in 2011 Congress imposed similar limitations on N.I.H. research, after a study funded by the N.I.H. showed that, on average, “guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault.” This past summer, the House Appropriations Committee rejected an amendment that would have lifted the C.D.C. restraints. Some well-designed studies on gun violence do see the light of day. Last week, Obama mentioned two of the more significant ones, each of which took advantage of the natural experiment offered when a state changes its laws. In 2007, Missouri eliminated a decades-old system under which every handgun buyer had to obtain a permit and undergo a background check. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the firearm-homicide rate increased by thirty-four per cent in the first year after the repeal and remained significantly higher than it had been, while the rate of homicides committed with other weapons did not change. Studies of this type don’t prove direct cause and effect, but this one is powerfully suggestive. The researchers controlled for other potential explanations, including changes in policing levels and incarceration rates, and the sharp increase was unique to the region and out of keeping with crime trends nationally. The firearm-suicide rate rose, too. Meanwhile, according to a study published last year in The American Journal of Public Health, a 1995 Connecticut law that did more or less the opposite—enacting the kind of permit system that Missouri dropped—was associated with a forty-per-cent reduction in firearm-homicide rates. In part, Obama is trying to reframe the gun discussion not as a Second Amendment issue but as one of public health. This approach acknowledges that, while we can’t eliminate gun crime, we can reduce it, and that doing something is better than fatalistically doing nothing. There will always be some who are convinced that, as a graphic that appeared on Ted Cruz’s Web site last week, depicting the President in SWAT gear, put it, “Obama wants your guns.” These are people who don’t like the federal government, don’t trust this President, and aren’t persuaded by data. But most Americans see something else at stake. Daniel Webster, a professor of health policy and management, who co-authored both studies, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch last month that since the repeal of the Missouri law there have been roughly fifty more homicides and sixty more suicides a year. The trade-off is stark, he said. Is the enhanced convenience of gun sellers and buyers worth those deaths? ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Will anything come of it? | Getty Simon Says By ROGER SIMON 01/06/2016 05:17 AM EST The tears of a president. What are they worth? What do they matter? Barack Obama twice wiped away tears that streaked down his face on Tuesday as he spoke about the victims of gun violence in America. He spoke of Sandy Hook, where 20 children went to school on Dec. 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut, and never came home. They were all 6 or 7. Their bodies were riddled by semiautomatic fire from a Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle. The shooter was 20. He had gotten the gun from the arsenal his mother kept in their upscale home in their safe community. He had known mental problems. But his mother thought that going target shooting with her son was a good way to “bond” with him and better than psychiatric treatment. He killed her shortly before he killed the children and six adults at Sandy Hook. Why? Why not? This is America. You feel blue or you get angry or you get drunk or you take drugs or you get driven by the demons speaking to you from inside your skull, and you grab a gun. “The United States of America is not the only country on Earth with violent or dangerous people,” the president said Tuesday. “We are not inherently more prone to violence. But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency.” Why? Guns are easy to get in America. That’s it. That’s the reason. Adults get slaughtered, kids get massacred, and politicians say, let’s not “politicize” the tragedy by talking about it — let alone doing anything about it. We must protect the Second Amendment, the politicians say, when what they really want to protect is the fat checks they get from the National Rifle Association. White House By SARAH WHEATON and NICK GASS “Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,” the president said Tuesday, wiping away a tear. “And, by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day,” he said, wiping away another. But it’s not about the numbers anymore. It is about the numbness. It’s difficult to keep the mass shootings straight. Columbine, Binghamton, Aurora, Blacksburg, Charleston, Fort Hood, the Navy Yard, Umpqua, San Bernardino. Keep them straight? We can barely remember them. And there are others. Many, many others. Obama spoke for 39 minutes. A long speech for the middle of the day. His first applause line came when he said he was speaking “not to debate the last mass shooting, but to do something to try to prevent the next one.” So, what are you going to do about that, Mr. President? We have heard your fine words before. I remember a nighttime speech in late July 2012 in Aurora, Colorado, after more than 80 people had been shot at a movie theater. Obama looked haggard that night. He stood before the cameras in a blue suit and white shirt, with no tie, and collar open. There was the beginning of stubble on his chin. “Scripture says that ‘He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more,’ ” Obama said. And then, a few minutes later, Obama put his hand to his throat to mark the spot where a teenager had been shot in the neck and killed by a bullet. Obama let his fingers linger there as he kept talking. As I wrote at the time: “It was wrenching, touching, dramatic, sincere. And baloney.” It was not baloney in the sense that Obama did not genuinely feel for the victims and their families. He did. But it was baloney that, in an election year, he was going to try to do much about it. His press secretary at the time, Jay Carney, had just told reporters aboard Air Force One that Obama “believes we need to take steps that protect Second Amendment rights” and “ensure that we are not allowing weapons into the hands of individuals who should not, by existing law, obtain those weapons.” Existing law? Wasn’t it kind of obvious that existing law was painfully inadequate to protect people from being shot to death at a movie? But it was an election year. A year of baloney. As Obama said Tuesday, however: “I’m not on the ballot again. I’m not looking to score some points.” What he was trying to do, he said, was to create in his last year in office “a sense of urgency.” “In Dr. King’s words, we need to feel the ‘fierce urgency of now,’” Obama said. “Because people are dying. And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do, no longer suffice.” The president is thoroughly sick of Congress and the politicians on Capitol Hill who have gone there not just to do nothing, but to prevent others from doing anything. So the president will act on his own. He will implement a set of modest executive actions to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, some of whom are forbidden to board planes but allowed to buy guns. Almost every Republican running for president has rushed to say that if he is elected, he will reverse Obama’s actions. The Democrats running all have plans to keep guns out of the hands of the violent. So this year’s presidential election offers a clear difference, a clear choice. Sadly, time is on the Democrats’ side. I say sadly because it is hard to believe that, between now and Election Day, we will not have more mass shootings, more preventable deaths, more avertible tragedies. “The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now. But they cannot hold America hostage,” Obama said. “We maybe can’t save everybody, but we can save some.” The president is trying to save some. Your vote is an opportunity to save more. And it is better than just shedding a tear. Roger Simon is POLITICO’s chief political columnist. Missing out on the latest scoops?

Shear and Eric Lichtblau WASHINGTON — President Obama will announce executive actions on Tuesday intended to expand background checks for some firearm purchases and step up federal enforcement of the nation’s gun laws, White House officials said Monday, once again trying to sidestep a gridlocked Congress on a politically divisive issue. But faced with clear legal limitations on his authority, Mr. Obama will take modest steps that stop well short of the kind of large-scale changes to the gun trade that he unsuccessfully sought from Congress three years ago. That legislation would have closed loopholes that allow millions of guns to be sold without background checks at gun shows or in online firearm exchanges. Instead, Mr. Obama will clarify that existing laws require anyone making a living by selling guns to register as a licensed gun dealer and conduct background checks. White House officials said the president would note that criminal penalties already exist for violating those laws. “We have to be very clear that this is not going to solve every violent crime in this country,” Mr. Obama said on Monday, ahead of a formal announcement on Tuesday. “It’s not going to prevent every mass shooting; it’s not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal.” Despite the limited nature of Mr. Obama’s executive actions, advocates on both sides appeared determined to describe them in sweeping terms for their own purposes. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said on Monday that “pretty soon, you won’t be able to get guns,” while a news release from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence predicted that “history will be made in the East Room of the White House tomorrow.” More guns were sold in December than almost any other month in nearly two decades after President Obama called for new gun-buying restrictions. White House officials acknowledge that Mr. Obama’s actions will intensify a fierce election-year debate about the Second Amendment and the limits of presidential power. That debate has grown in the last several days, with gun rights activists and Republican presidential candidates condemning the president’s expected actions as a power grab, and victims’ groups hailing them as a victory. Frustrated by his inability to secure tougher gun laws despite a series of mass shootings, Mr. Obama is determined to demonstrate that he is doing something on the gun issue, even as he is mindful of the limits on his authority. Under his plan, the White House said, officials from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will begin contacting gun sellers to let them know of new standards to “clarify” who would be considered a regulated dealer — taking into account factors such as whether someone has a business card, uses a website or sells guns in their original packaging. But there will be no set number for defining how many guns sold would make someone a “dealer” — a standard that some groups had pushed as essential to giving the changes more teeth. White House officials said someone could sell as few as one or two guns yet still be considered a dealer whose sales are subject to background checks. The changes are particularly meant for online gun merchants, who often avoid conducting background checks despite making high-volume gun sales through websites like armslist.com. “Right now it’s really an Internet loophole,” Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said Monday. “Gun sales are moving online.” All of the Democratic candidates want new gun laws, while nearly all Republicans are against additional restrictions they see as harmful to Second Amendment rights. Mr. Obama will hire more personnel to process background checks in a timely manner, direct officials to conduct more gun research, improve the information in the background check system, encourage more domestic violence prosecutions and order better tracking of lost guns. He will also make it easier for states to provide mental health information to the background check system, which could bar a gun sale. But officials said it was impossible to predict whether the new directives would have made any difference in recent shootings, such as the one in San Bernardino, Calif. “We can and must do something about it,” Valerie Jarrett, a top adviser to Mr. Obama, said on Monday. “Our politics unite us together when we are taking on other epidemics, so why not gun violence?” The gun issue has vexed Mr. Obama for years. In the weeks after the December 2012 massacre of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Obama vowed to seek new gun laws from Congress that would require background checks for all firearms purchases. That effort failed several months later, despite high-profile efforts by the president to persuade members of Congress. Visibly angry, Mr. Obama scolded lawmakers during Rose Garden remarks, calling it “a pretty shameful day for Washington.” In the years that followed, Mr. Obama largely abandoned his pursuit of new gun laws, even in the face of more mass shootings. In October, however, the shooting at a college in Oregon prompted Mr. Obama to again promise action, telling his aides to “scrub the law” for actions he could take to prevent further gun violence. By taking action without Congress, Mr. Obama again risks a legal challenge to his authority that could block his orders for the remainder of his term. A legal challenge to the president’s plan to protect up to five million illegal immigrants from deportation and provide them work permits remains locked in litigation. The Supreme Court could agree to take up the immigration case later this month. But in the case of guns, Mr. Obama may have chosen to err on the side of caution, telling reporters after an Oval Office meeting with Ms. Lynch on Monday that his actions would be “well within” his legal authority. A spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association said on Monday that the organization’s lawyers would look at the president’s proposals more closely to determine if there was anything they might go to court to challenge. But she said that at first glance the plan seemed surprisingly thin. “This is it, really?” asked Jennifer Baker, an official with the N.R.A.’s Washington lobbying arm. “This is what they’ve been hyping for how long now? This is the proposal they’ve spent seven years putting together? They’re not really doing anything.” Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California and the chairman of the gun control caucus in the House, praised the president for taking action but said it would not be enough to solve the problem of mass shootings and gun violence. “I think he’s done all that he can do under his authority,” Mr. Thompson said. “What really needs to be done is the laws need to be changed. There needs to be a law that says you buy a gun, you get a background check.” Advertisement",2016-01-05 07:00:00,Obama to Expand Gun Background Checks and Tighten Enforcement,,1,http://nytimes.com

Nikki Haley is a rising star among Republicans and a potential vice president pick. | AP Photo By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL 01/11/2016 04:13 PM EST Updated 01/11/2016 06:57 PM EST Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Monday blasted South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the Republican Party’s pick to deliver the GOP's response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address on Tuesday. “It's pretty clear that Nikki Haley is being chosen because the Republican Party has a diversity problem,” Wasserman Schultz said on a conference call previewing the speech. Haley, a rising star among Republicans and a potential vice president pick, was born to Indian immigrants in Bamberg, South Carolina. She is the youngest governor in the U.S. and the first female and first minority governor of the state, which stepped into the national spotlight last summer after a racially charged mass shooting left nine parishioners of a black church dead. Haley’s profile grew dramatically as she signed a bill removing the controversial Confederate flag from statehouse grounds after the attack. In their announcement, Republican congressional leaders touted Haley’s record. She drove the state’s jobless rate to record lows, added tens of thousands of jobs and passed watershed education reforms, they said. But Wasserman Schultz shared a sharply different view. By ALEX ISENSTADT “Haley’s failed record gives her no credibility whatsoever,” she added, according to an excerpt of the call. “In fact it exemplifies exactly why the last thing we need is a Republican to make the same mistakes at the national level.” During the conference call, Wasserman Schultz also praised Obama’s record, noting job growth, the impact of Obamacare and his most recent actions executive actions on gun control. “But as we enter this election year, we are faced with Republican presidential candidates who would take back the gains we’ve made, who’ve promised to start rolling it all back on day one,” she said. “We can’t let that happen. There’s still more work to do to have an economy that gives everyone in America a fair shot. We still need a president who understands how to use all elements of our national power to keep this country safe, without offending our most important allies.” House Speaker Paul Ryan, who helped choose Haley for the Republican response, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Monday he was excited for it. “If you wanna hear an inclusive leader, who's visionary, who's got a path for the future, who's brought people together, who's unified, it's Nikki Haley,” Ryan said. “That's who we're gonna hear from tomorrow night. I think she's the perfect person for it.” A DNC official told POLITICO that Wasserman Schultz’s comment regarding the GOP’s “diversity problem” was in response to a question on the call, which the official said largely focused on employment since Obama took over after the George W. Bush administration. The official also pointed to a 2013 autopsy report from the Republican National Committee to show that Wasserman Schultz’s remarks weren’t meant to be incendiary. The report’s recommendations included better engagement and communication with women and minorities and creation of a surrogate list of women within the party that listed Haley by name.

          / CBS News President Obama will participate in a live town hall on reducing gun violence in the U.S., according to a White House official. On Thursday evening, from 8pm-9pm ET, Mr. Obama will join CNN's Anderson Cooper for a town hall in northern Virginia, at George Mason University. Cooper will be moderating the discussion, the official said, and the president will answer questions from the audience. Earlier in the week, on Monday, the president will be meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to discuss options on executive measures aimed at reducing gun violence. For several months, since the mass shooting at an Oregon community college, White House and Justice Department lawyers have, under the president's direction, been reviewing measures the president can take unilaterally, combing the law to see if any unused administrative authority is available to him. President Obama said in July that he has been ""most frustrated and most stymied"" by the country's inability to enact ""sufficient, common sense gun safety laws.""

374,http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/01/05/media-loses-interest-houston-mosque-arson-muslim-charged/,"HOUSTON, Texas—The Muslim charged with setting fire to his own mosque turned over his passport and the judge set his bond at $150,000 on Monday. He remains in jail. True to a prediction by Breitbart News’ John Nolte, once authorities revealed the identity of the alleged arsonist as not a white racist inspired by Donald Trump but a Muslim, the mainstream media lost interest in the story. Moore did not appear in court but was represented by his attorney Edward M. Chernoff. His arraignment where charges will be formally read against him has been reset upon the request of his lawyer. He will have an opportunity to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty at that time. Gary Nathaniel Moore has been charged with arson in a place of worship, a first degree felony. As reported by Breitbart Texas, the charging instrument stated that Moore started a fire by igniting materials at a place of worship on Christmas Day. The complaint charges that he used and exhibited a deadly weapon, namely a fire, to commit the felony offense of arson at the Savoy Masjid Mosque in Houston. Moore told a Houston fire investigator that he has been a member of the mosque for five years, and comes to the mosque to pray five times a day, seven days a week, as reported by Breitbart Texas. Breitbart News reported shortly after Moore’s arrest that the media immediately exploited the conflagration at the mosque to place the blame for the fire on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The theory quickly went up in smoke upon the devout Muslim’s arrest. CBS, CNN, and NBC media outlets all published articles reporting the arson should be investigated because of the “recent spike in hate incidents targeting mosques nationwide.” Breitbart News reported that a CBS News article said that advocacy groups believed “that there has been a spike in anti-Muslim incidents across the United States in recent weeks that can be linked to the mass shooting in California and the inflammatory rhetoric of Donald Trump and other presidential candidates. And they say that Muslims are fearful the backlash could lead to further harassment and violence.” Salon.com also refused to change an extremely misleading headline that blamed the fire on “anti-Muslim violence,” even after the identity of the Muslim suspect became known, as reported by Breitbart News. The prediction by Breitbart News’ John Nolte that “[n]ow that a devout Muslim has been charged, the DC Media will forget all about the incident” has become true. With the exception of the hometown paper, the Houston Chronicle, and a few other Texas media outlets, Moore’s latest court appearance has gone largely unreported. Moore is scheduled to be back in court on January 20. Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

          / CBS News Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, on Monday called President Obama's forthcoming executive action to curb gun violence a ""dangerous level of executive overreach."" ""While we don't yet know the details of the plan, the president is at minimum subverting the legislative branch, and potentially overturning its will,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""No president should be able to reverse legislative failure by executive fiat, not even incrementally. The American people deserve a president who will respect their constitutional rights - all of them."" Despite his acknowledgement that he doesn't yet know what Mr. Obama plans to do, Ryan asserted that the expected executive actions wouldn't have stopped some of the recent mass shootings. ""We all are pained by the recent atrocities in our country, but no change the president is reportedly considering would have prevented them,"" Ryan said. ""We have seen consistently that an underlying cause of these attacks has been mental illness, and we should look at ways to address this problem."" Before Congress left Capitol Hill for the holidays last month, Ryan expressed support for a mental health reform bill proposed by Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pennsylvania. In his statement Monday, Ryan said that the president is further intruding into ""innocent Americans' lives"" and will be ""targeting law-abiding citizens."" The president is meeting Monday to discuss the possible executive actions with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, ATF Deputy Director Thomas Brandon and FBI Director James Comey. Mr. Obama is expected to formally unveil the actions in the coming days, several months after he directed the White House and the Justice Department following October's mass shooting in Oregon to evaluate his executive authority on the issue. One area the administration has been focusing on has been the so-called ""gun show loophole."" The loophole allows some gun sellers to avoid conducting background checks before making sales. Under current law, people who buy a firearm from anyone ""engaged in the business"" of selling guns are required to undergo background checks. But sales made from a person's personal collections, for example, are not subject to background checks. Mr. Obama could expand the definition of who qualifies as ""in the business,"" based on the number of gun sales or other factors. While such a move wouldn't eliminate the loophole, it could significantly increase the number of firearm purchases that are subject to background checks. The president is scheduled to participate in a town hall on reducing gun violence at 8pm ET on Thursday on CNN. Ryan joins a chorus of other Republicans who so far have also pounced on the president. GOP presidential contenders Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, for instance, have already vowed to reverse the executive actions if either is elected president in November.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. On 'America's Newsroom,' Rep. Adam Kinzinger reacts to the purchase of machine guns from undercover agents as part of an attack plan MILWAUKEE – A Milwaukee man wanted to storm a Masonic temple with a machine gun and kill at least 30 people in an attack he hoped would show ""nobody can play with Muslims"" and spark more mass shootings in the United States, federal agents said Tuesday after the man's arrest. Federal prosecutors charged 23-year-old Samy Mohamed Hamzeh with unlawfully possessing a machine gun and receiving and possessing firearms not registered to him. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney, Dean Puschnig, didn't immediately respond to a question asking why charges were limited to gun possession. Hamzeh's attorney, federal defender Ronnie Murray, didn't immediately return email and voicemail messages left after business hours. According to an FBI affidavit, agents were tipped off in September that Hamzeh planned to travel to Israel in October to attack Israeli soldiers and citizens in the West Bank. He abandoned those plans due to ""family, financial and logistic reasons,"" the affidavit said, but refocused his efforts on a domestic attack. Hamzeh discussed his plans extensively with two FBI informants. The affidavit said the FBI started recording his conversations with the informants in October. Hamzeh and the two informants traveled to a gun range on Jan. 19 and practiced with a pistol. Afterward they took a tour of a Masonic temple in Milwaukee. The affidavit does not name the temple and Puschnig declined to identify it. Masons are members of a fraternal organization that carries out a variety of activities including charity work. Wisconsin has nearly 11,000 Masons in 180 lodges, according to Frank Struble, grand master of Free and Accepted Masons in Wisconsin. The organization is not a religion. Struble said the allegations were ""hard to hear."" He said he knew which Masonic center had been targeted but declined to identify it. ""Masons are a part of an organization that helped build this country,"" Struble said. ""I can understand from that standpoint where someone who is against this country would target us."" The owner of a downtown Milwaukee gym said she recently fired Hamzeh after hiring him as a trainer just a few weeks ago. Delia Luna of 9Round Kickbox Fitness described Hamzeh as ""very intense, very militant"" as a trainer and said he didn't fit the atmosphere she wanted to create. ""He didn't mix well,"" Luna said. Federal agents said that on Jan. 19 and into the early morning of Jan. 20, Hamzeh discussed his plans to attack the temple with the informants, telling them they needed two more machine guns — the group apparently already had one — and silencers. They planned to station one person at the temple's entrance while the other two went through the building, killing everyone they saw. They then planned to walk away from the scene as if nothing had happened. ""I am telling you, if this hit is executed, it will be known all over the world ... all the Mujahedeen will be talking and they will be proud of us,"" Hamzeh said, according to the affidavit. ""Such operations will increase in America, when they hear about it. The people will be scared and the operations will increase. ... This way we will be igniting it. I mean we are marching at the front of the war."" Hamzeh added that he hoped to kill 30 people, ""because these 30 will terrify the world. The (expletive) will know that nobody can play with Muslims."" He added, ""We are here defending Islam, young people together join to defend Islam, that's it, that is what our intention is."" According to the affidavit, Hamzeh met with two undercover FBI agents on Monday. They presented him with two automatic machine guns and a silencer. He paid for the weapons and silencer in cash and put them in the trunk of his car. The agents then arrested him and recovered the guns and silencer. Hamzeh's arrest marks the Milwaukee area's second brush with a mass shooting in less than four years. A white supremacist named Wade Michael Page fatally shot six people at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, a Milwaukee suburb, in 2012. Page shot himself in the head after a police officer wounded him. Last month Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a social services center in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people. They later died in a shootout with police.

382,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/zd2i9M9NGEw/,"Just as they did when we were assured we could keep our health insurance, the hopelessly corrupt, rotted-out DC Media and Barack Obama are once again coordinating to pull the wool over the eyes of the American people, to lull us into a false sense of security before the boom falls. And make no mistake, the sinister plan is to drop the boom, maybe not on Obama’s watch, but the seeds have been planted: These people plan to flood the country with illegals, refugees, and early-release prisoners,  and then disarm us. Chaos reigns. The same federal government that caused the problem poses as savior, and now that same federal government is stronger and more intrusive than ever before. The Left makes no secret of this plan. It’s called the Cloward-Piven Strategy of Orchestrated Crisis. The DC media won’t talk about this because they are all in on it. It’s no secret either that if you boil the DC media down to its dark essence that what you will find is an institution dedicated to ennobling and empowering the federal government. Ask yourself… When was the last time the DC media called for a less intrusive government, for more local control, for state solution as opposed to one-size-fits-all federal solutions? They never do. Ever. The idea is to always present central government as the solution to everything,. When CNN parks its satellite truck in Ferguson and Baltimore and openly calls for riots, what do you think is going on there? Other than come right out and use the words “Cloward” and “Piven,” the Left makes no secret of its desire to see the world burn, literally. Domestic terrorist Bill Ayers is an open advocate of Cloward-Piven. Obama launched his political career in Ayers’ living room. Moreover, Obama and Hillary have made no secret of their desire to confiscate our guns. The fact that the DC Media coordinates to cover this truth up does not make it any less of a truth. Barack Obama, June 2014: Couple of decades ago, Australia had a mass shooting, similar to Columbine or Newtown. And Australia just said, well, that’s it, we’re not doing, we’re not seeing that again, and basically imposed very severe, tough gun laws, and they haven’t had a mass shooting since. Our levels of gun violence are off the charts. There’s no advanced, developed country that would put up with this. Barack Obama, June 2015: “When Australia had a mass killing – I think it was in Tasmania – about 25 years ago, it was just so shocking the entire country said ‘well we’re going to completely change our gun laws’, and they did. And it hasn’t happened since.” … “I don’t foresee any legislative action being taken in this Congress,” he said. “And I don’t foresee any real action until the American public feels a sufficient sense of urgency and they say to themselves, ‘This is not normal, this is something that we can change and we’re going to change it’.” Obama also lamented the rush of Americans who go and buy firearms after US shootings and the “extremely strong” grip the powerful lobby group the National Rifle Association has on Congress. Hillary Clinton, October 2015 You know, Australia’s a good example, Canada’s a good example, [and] the UK’s a good example. Why? Because each of them had mass killings, Australia had a huge mass killing about 20 or 25 years ago. Canada did as well, so did the UK. In reaction, they passed much stricter gun laws. In the Australian example, as I recall, that was a buyback program. The Australian government as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of…weapons offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns and basically clamped down going forward, in terms of having more of a background check approach–more of a permitting approach. Unless you follow New Media, because the DC media covers this truth up, you have no idea what Obama and Hillary are advocating for, you have no idea that the primary component of the Australia gun law was CONFISCATION through a government-mandated buyback program: In the wake of the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, when Martin Bryant shot and killed 35 people and wounded 23, prime minister John Howard pushed through laws banning automatic, semi-automatic and pump action guns, and enacted a comprehensive gun buy-back scheme, despite strong opposition from parts of the Australian community. Obama and Hillary are bound and determined to confiscate your guns. And because the DC Media is bound and determined to take your guns, the truth behind Australia’s mandated confiscation is buried. If you want to stump a so-called journalist, tweet them this question: “If Obama and Hillary don’t want to confiscate guns, why do YOU think they praise Australia?” Meanwhile…  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC PoliticsBarack Hussein ObamaHillary Clinton 2016Media Bias .

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Correspondent Kevin Corke reports from Honolulu, Hawaii The National Rifle Association, the country’s most influential gun-rights supporter, is challenging President Obama’s new plan to use his presidential powers to tighten firearms laws, calling it a “political stunt” that fails to increase public safety. Obama said this weekend that he’ll meet Monday with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to discuss his “options” toward curbing gun violence, after ordering his White House team several months ago to identify “new actions” that he can take. The president also said that he’s taking action because Congress has failed to act. He is expected to use so-called executive orders to tighten federal laws -- with a focus on small-scale firearms sellers and background checks for gun buyers, according to Politico. ""President Obama failed to pass his anti-gun agenda though Congress because the majority of Americans oppose more gun-control,” NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said in response late Saturday. “Now he is doing what he always does when he doesn’t get his way, which is defy the will of the people and issue an executive order.” Obama said Friday that Congress has “done nothing” and declared that he has “unfinished business.” “I get too many letters from parents and teachers and kids to sit around and do nothing,” he said in a weekly address from Hawaii, from which he’ll return next week after a two-week family vacation. The anticipated changes would require the small-scale gun sellers to submit background checks for potential buyers but such changes are not expected to completely close the so-called “gun show loophole,” which allows for firearm purchases at such venues without a check. Obama on Friday pointed out that his new plan follows the third anniversary of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, in Newtown, Conn., in which a deranged gunman killed 20 children and six adults. However, the Obama-driven effort to tighten gun laws in the aftermath of the massacre failed to get enough support for passage from Senate Democrats and Republicans. “All across America, survivors of gun violence and those who lost a child, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to mark such awful anniversaries every single day,” Obama said. “Yet Congress still hasn’t done anything to prevent what happened to them from happening to other families.” The president’s course of action will purportedly follow recommendations from Everytown, the gun-control nonprofit led by billionaire, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Obama's action will also result in a rematch with the NRA, the group that led the successful attempt to defeat Obama’s post-Sandy Hook efforts. “Three years ago, a bipartisan, commonsense bill would have required background checks for virtually everyone who buys a gun,” Obama said Friday. “This policy was supported by some 90 percent of the American people. It was supported by a majority of NRA households. But the gun lobby mobilized against it. And the Senate blocked it.” Baker on Saturday said Obama’s renewed effort is “nothing more than a political stunt to appease anti-gun billionaire Michael Bloomberg and will do nothing to increase public safety.” Existing law states those who sell guns with the “principal objective of livelihood and profit” have to get a dealer’s license through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. That means they also have to conduct a background check on buyers no matter where they sell, including online or at a gun show. In 2014, the ATF proposed that federal officials be notified about lost firearms, but the gun industry successfully argued that voluntary reporting was sufficient.

Matt Finn reports from Chicago The mother of a man accused of planning a mass shooting at a Masonic temple in Milwaukee says her son was set up by the FBI. Despite a federal criminal complaint describing Samy Mohamed Hamzeh as a Muslim extremist, Khawla Hamzeh said her 23-year-old son is immature, not very religious and was just trying to convince his friends he was tough. ""He's not mature. You know guys, they want to show they are brave,"" she told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Hamzeh, who was born in New Jersey, has been charged with unlawfully possessing a machine gun and receiving and possessing improperly registered firearms, and is accused -- but not indicted -- of planning to attack a downtown Masonic center and kill 30 people. Hamzeh was originally being held at the Waukesha County Jail before being moved to the Kenosha County Jail. A source told WITI-TV Wednesday Hamzeh was placed on suicide watch after making threats to himself and to staff members at the jail. Hamzeh’s next hearing is scheduled for Feb. 9. According to court documents, FBI agents were tipped off in September that Hamzeh planned to travel to Israel to attack Israeli soldiers and citizens in the West Bank. He abandoned those plans due to ""family, financial and logistic reasons,"" instead focusing his efforts on a domestic attack. Hamzeh was arrested Monday, after he paid two undercover FBI agents for two automatic machine guns and a silencer and put them in the trunk of his car. During his court appearance Tuesday, he told U.S. Magistrate Judge David Jones that he had read and understood the federal complaint filed against him, but that he doesn't agree with it. The hearing was closed to the media, but the newspaper obtained an audio recording of the hearing and posted it on the newspaper's website. Khawla Hamzeh said she was constantly reminding her son to pray and didn't like his violent video games. But she said he was a loving son who hugged and kissed her often. ""I can't believe this is my son. Everybody in Milwaukee loves Samy,"" his mother told the newspaper. ""He never fights with anyone."" She believes her son was set up and led astray by the FBI. ""The first day he tell his friend he want to do something, take him to the jail. Take him to the doctor. They watch him for months!"" she said. ""Why (would the FBI) sell my son the gun?"" The Hamzehs are from Jordan and have moved back and forth to the United States. Samy Hamzeh was supporting his family because his father was having trouble finding steady work since moving to the U.S. last spring, his mother said. Khawla Hamzeh said her son wasn't acting any differently when she made him breakfast Monday. He didn't have mental health problems, she said, although he was worried about money since he supported the family and had recently been fired from his job as a trainer. ""He spent his money for us. He'd say, `Mama, take this money. Just give me $10,' "" she said. ""He pay $900 for the house, $120 for the gas and electricity. When he stopped working, he feel very sad.""

(Getty) By JOSH GERSTEIN 01/20/2016 10:52 AM EST Updated 01/20/2016 04:30 PM EST A powerful Republican senator is complaining that President Barack Obama is undercutting his campaign against gun violence by allowing some drug criminals convicted of gun crimes to be released from prison before their sentences are complete. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said Obama's issuance of commutations for firearm-related crimes is sending ""mixed messages"" about whether the federal government is serious about cracking down on the illegal use of guns. ""The president's action to commute the sentences of individuals convicted of illegally possessing a firearm is disturbing,"" Shelby said Wednesday at an appropriations subcommittee hearing with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Obama's recent executive actions on guns. ""I don't know these individuals or why the president felt they needed shorter sentences. ... This sends a message to criminals: If you commit a crime with a gun, the president will not go hard on you."" Asked about Shelby's criticism, a White House spokesperson said the recipients of Obama's commutations had demonstrated their capacity for rehabilitation. ""As he has since taking office, the president will continue to evaluate each recommendation from the Justice Department and grant clemency based on an individualized assessment of each case. The individuals who have thus far received a presidential commutation have demonstrated the ability to turn their life around, and the vast majority have served far longer sentences than they would have if convicted of the same crime today,"" spokesperson Brandi Hoffine said. A White House official also noted that the commutations don't erase the recipients' convictions or affect restrictions on their rights to own weapons. In 2014, Obama launched a ""clemency initiative"" that offered early release to drug convicts who had served sentences of more than 10 years and who might have gotten a shorter sentence under current laws and guidelines. The Justice Department's guidelines for the program said applicants needed to be ""non-violent,"" but the criteria were silent about whether possession of a weapon in the course of a drug crime would be disqualifying. A gun charge appears not to have been an insurmountable obstacle to getting a commutation. A POLITICO tally found 25 of the 187 issued by Obama were for individuals convicted of illegal firearms possession in addition to drug violations. Lynch said she wasn't familiar with those cases but that commutation and pardon applications ""are carefully reviewed and carefully vetted."" She said recipients are supposed to be ""nonviolent"" and ""individuals who, today, would not necessarily have received the sentences"" they got years ago. The exchange over Obama's clemency actions came as Lynch defended the president's latest round of gun-related executive actions, arguing that they're well within his legal authority. ""I have complete confidence that the common-sense steps announced by the president are lawful. They are consistent with the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court and the laws passed by Congress,"" Lynch said. In a Jan. 5 speech, Obama announced a series of steps responding to several high-profile mass shootings, including a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, last month that left 14 people dead. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, part of the Justice Department, announced new guidance asserting that individuals who are in the business of selling guns or who sell guns among other items at gun shows must register as federal firearms dealers and conduct background checks on buyers. The administration also issued new regulations on who must give notice when gun shipments are lost and created an exemption allowing mental health professionals to report potentially dangerous patients for inclusion in the background check database. ""The steps that I have outlined and the actions that President Obama has described are all well-reasoned measures, well within existing legal authorities, built on work that’s already underway. They clarify laws that are already on the books because clear notice will help ensure that those laws are followed,"" Lynch said. Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates have blasted Obama's announcement as another unlawful grab of executive power. ""It is clear to me that the American people are fearful that President Obama is eager to strip them of their Second Amendment rights,"" Shelby said at the outset of the hearing of the Commerce, Justice & Science subcommittee he oversees. ""President Obama, I believe, is far too willing to end-run Congress through executive action. ... I'm concerned that the president is slowly chipping away at our Second Amendment rights."" ""Part of the executive actions seem ambiguous and provide some confusion"" for gun owners, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said. Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) expressed concern about plans to have the Social Security Administration notify a federal gun background check database when a Social Security recipient has named another person to receive payments for them. Boozman said this could result in someone losing his or her right to own a gun simply because they decided to let a family member handle their finances. ""I'm concerned because there were not changes through Congress. ... That really is a real concern,"" Boozman said. Lynch said Social Security officials are taking comment on how to handle such notifications and that any rules issued would include a way for people who are reported to the database to get notice of such a decision and be able to appeal it. Some Democratic senators contended that the GOP was exaggerating the impact of Obama's proposals. ""I applaud the president for taking small steps to strengthen the enforcement of existing gun laws,"" Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) said. ""I hope that people will read through what this guidance actually says,"" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said. Despite the sharp criticism of some of Obama's proposals, some common ground was on display Wednesday, as senators and witnesses expressed support for improving mental health treatment and for speeding up background checks. However, one witness who followed Lynch blasted Congress for its inaction in response to widespread gun violence. ""Shamefully, Congress has done nothing to address this epidemic,"" said Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son, Daniel, was killed in the 2012 shooting spree that killed 20 students and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. ""Take a moment to consider the humanity and the personal impact of what has been taken from us and what is at stake here. ... President Obama is trying to do something; please help him."" Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, a Republican, called Obama's moves ""an unwarranted attack on the Second Amendment."" He also said local law enforcement leaders believe a better way to limit gun crime would be to ""stop releasing violent criminals from jail before their sentences are completed."" Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said Obama's proposals were ""Intentionally intimidating and harassing of law-abiding citizens in order to get them to shy away from selling guns that they legally own."" He added that none of Obama's executive actions ""would have any meaningful effect on tragedies"" like the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007 or the terrorist shooting in San Bernardino last month. However, Murphy said the critics' objections were not rooted in the wording of the guidance the Obama administration issued. ""It's important that, when pressed, none of our witnesses could recite any actual verbiage in the order that relates to this claim of intimidation,"" Murphy said. ""There is just a fundamental disagreement about what is actually on the page here. I hope as we have this debate it is not anchored in perceived intentions. ""The paranoia about the president's secret plan is a play to pad the profits of the gun lobby,"" Murphy said when speaking with reporters after the hearing. Lynch's appearance before the Senate panel came one day after two legal developments involving other Obama claims of executive authority. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court announced it will decide the legality of another major executive action by the president: his move in 2014 to grant quasi-legal status and work permits to up to 5 million immigrants who entered or stayed in the U.S. illegally as children or who have children who are U.S. citizens or green card holders. Later in the day, a federal court in Washington rejected Obama's claim of executive privilege to withhold thousands of pages of records a House committee subpoenaed about Operation Fast and Furious, a so-called ""gunwalking"" operation that led to as many as 2,000 firearms making their way illegally to Mexico.

391,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/L4COn9ZXbJ8/,"Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke (D) argued that “President Obama and Mrs. Bill Clinton” “are anti-gun bigots” and Obama doesn’t want to go after the real perpetrators of violence, “the underclass young black male” on Wednesday’s “Hannity” on the Fox News Channel. Clarke said, “as far as President Obama and Mrs. Bill Clinton, they are anti-gun bigots. They are utterly intolerant to anybody else’s view when it comes to — other than their own when it comes to the second amendment, shooting sports, and self-defense. But you watch, by next summer, she’ll be photographed walking around in a field like she’s hunting, participating in the shooting sports, with a gun resting on her shoulder, probably holding it upside down.” He added, “if you want to reduce violence, and the president knows this, you target criminals. you do not law — otherwise law-abiding citizens. and you don’t make them have to go jump through hoops, in a higher threshold to exercise their second amendment right. But Sean, if he goes after the real perpetrators of violence in America, he would have to target the underclass young black male, and — who disproportionately is involved in all this violence, and he doesn’t want to do that.” Clarke further stated, “I want as many law-abiding citizens to arm themselves in this country as we can get so that I have the partner that I need to beat back this sort of violence. And in these mass shooting situations, you’re right, the great equalizer is a law-abiding citizen in that situation, with a firearm, that can take action, because when seconds count, the police are usually minutes away.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett 2nd AmendmentClipsPoliticsBarack ObamaDavid Clarkegun control .

Shear WASHINGTON — As tears streamed down his face, President Obama on Tuesday condemned the gun violence that has reached across the United States and vowed to curb the bloodshed with or without Congress. “In this room right here, there are a lot of stories. There’s a lot of heartache,” Mr. Obama said in the White House East Room, flanked by relatives of those struck down in mass shootings, including former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. “There’s a lot of resilience, there’s a lot of strength, but there’s also a lot of pain.” For all the emotion he showed, Mr. Obama nonetheless faces legal, political and logistical hurdles that are likely to blunt the effect of the plan he laid out. A number of the executive actions he plans are only suggested “guidance” for federal agencies, not binding regulations. They were framed mostly as clarifying and enforcing existing law, not expanding it. And many of those measures rely on hefty funding increases that a Republican-led Congress is almost certain to reject. Among other measures, the plan aims to better define who should be licensed as a gun dealer and thus be required to conduct background checks on customers to weed out prohibited buyers. Even the administration said it was impossible to gauge how big an effect the steps might have, how many new gun sales might be regulated or how many illegal guns might be taken off the streets. “I don’t think anyone can credibly tell you yet what all this means,” Charles E. James Jr., a former federal gun crimes prosecutor who now represents gun industry clients, said of Mr. Obama’s plan. More guns were sold in December than almost any other month in nearly two decades after President Obama called for new gun-buying restrictions. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch told reporters Monday that she could not say whether the new restrictions would have had any effect in a series of recent mass shootings, including last month’s attack in San Bernardino, Calif., that left 14 dead. But in the massacre of nine people at a South Carolina church in June, the man charged, Dylan Roof, was able to buy a .45-caliber handgun despite admitting to drug use. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said at the time that a breakdown in the background check system had allowed Mr. Roof to buy the gun. Mr. Obama voiced irritation over the issue. “Each time this comes up,” Mr. Obama said in his speech, “we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying. I reject that thinking. We know we can’t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence.” Nearly 21 million gun sales were processed through the background check system in 2014, but some industry analysts say as many as 40 percent more firearms could have been sold through private transactions not subject to background checks. Even the most hopeful advocates say the new plan would affect only thousands of sales. Proposals that would have the biggest effect have long been shelved by even the most ardent gun control advocates who now see an assault weapons ban or mandatory gun buyback programs like ones in Australia in 1996 and 2003 as political fantasy. Modest as the new measures may prove to be, the response was unrestrained. Republican presidential candidates and congressional leaders greeted them with peals of protests and angry claims of a “gun grab” that would violate Second Amendment rights. Gun control advocates hailed them as a breakthrough in what has often been a losing battle to toughen firearms restrictions. The families of gun victims and gun control activists crowded into the White House and watched Mr. Obama break down as he recalled the young children gunned down by an assailant in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. “First graders,” the president said, his eyes drifting off and becoming red with tears. He wiped his face and paused to regain his composure: “Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad.” A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check. By taking action, Mr. Obama is purposely stoking a furious political debate that has roiled Congress and spilled over into the presidential campaign. Vowing last year to “politicize” the gun issue after a mass shooting at an Oregon community college, Mr. Obama on Tuesday made good on that promise. The National Rifle Association, targeted by Mr. Obama in his speech, mocked his tears. “The American people do not need more emotional, condescending lectures that are completely devoid of facts,” said Chris W. Cox, the group’s top lobbyist. Republican presidential candidates also raced to condemn Mr. Obama, with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas putting up a web page with a menacing, altered picture of the president in a commando outfit. A caption read “Obama Wants Your Guns” next to a fund-raising appeal. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin posted his opposition on Twitter as the president spoke, saying Mr. Obama’s “words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty.” But Mr. Obama’s allies were equally intense in their defense. Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, posted on Twitter from the East Room: “President wiping tears. So am I. One of the most moving things I’ve ever seen.” Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, posted a “thank you” to Mr. Obama for “taking a crucial step forward on gun violence.” Mr. Obama’s plan is likely to face legal challenges from gun rights groups that accuse him of overstepping his executive authority. A number of critics said they suspected that the president’s push to “clarify” the definition of licensed gun dealers could force even the occasional gun seller to register their transactions. Shortly before Mr. Obama’s remarks, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released guidance to gun sellers on the criteria that could qualify someone as a gun “dealer” who needs to be licensed and conduct background checks. Those criteria include having a website, using business cards or selling new guns in their original packages. The 14-page pamphlet, posted on the agency’s website, offers examples to help guide sellers, such as “Bob,” who wants to sell a gun collection that he inherited (he would not need to be licensed) and “Sharon,” who sells guns at flea markets every weekend (she would need to be licensed). But the administration rejected more aggressive options, such as establishing a defined threshold for the number of gun sales that would qualify someone as a dealer required to conduct background checks. White House officials were mindful of the legal reversals sustained when the president tried to grant legal immigration status by executive action to five million immigrants in the country illegally, and they said they tried to make the gun plan as safe from legal attacks as possible. “This is really pretty modest stuff,” said Ladd Everitt, the communications director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, an advocacy group. Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum in Washington, who attended Mr. Obama’s speech, said many police organizations had been pushing for more background checks on firearm purchases. While he praised Mr. Obama for taking action, he said more needed to be done. “If Congress doesn’t allow for legislation, I think he went as far as he could using the bully pulpit,” Mr. Wexler said. With Congress unwilling to act, many gun control groups have turned to states for changes, with 18 states now imposing some form of background check.

            Business Obama's call for more gun control has accelerated the recent surge in gun sales that began last month with the mass shooting in San Bernardino that claimed 14 lives. ""Tremendous, literally tremendous,"" said Bob Irwin, owner of The Gun Store in Las Vegas, shortly after Obama delivered a speech on expanding background checks. ""It started with San Bernardino but Obama has just added to it. We can't keep guns in stock. Some of our major wholesalers are basically out of all the stuff that sells."" Irwin said his gun sales have doubled in the last two weeks. He said 90% of all sales are handguns ""that they can grab with one hand and defend themselves,"" but he has also ""sold a few of what they call assault rifles."" He believes the ""absolute random"" nature of the San Bernardino massacre is what freaked people out and drove them to buy guns for self-protection. ""Everybody's vulnerable,"" said Irwin. ""You didn't have to go the wrong place at the wrong time to get murdered,"" he said. ""It was like the Paris attacks, but here [in the U.S.]"" Wilshire Gun, a gun range/bar/restaurant in Oklahoma City, has experienced a dramatic rise in students for its concealed carry courses, according to general manager Brad Carroll. ""The political environment has bolstered that,"" he said. ""A record number of people are doing concealed carry."" The courses required for concealed carry permits have gone from 70% to full to booked solid through January, Carroll said. Overflow students are paying extra to schedule private courses. Related: How background checks work Last year was a record year for FBI background checks, which are conducted for most gun sales. On Monday, Obama called for more resources to bolster the effectiveness of background checks. He assured gun owners that he believes in the Second Amendment and his actions are ""not a plot to take away everybody's guns."" But Paul Bastean, owner of Ultimate Defense Firing Range in St. Peters, Missouri, said every time Obama talks about guns, sales go up. The most current surge in sales came after Obama made remarks following the San Bernardino attacks, when he mentioned ""common sense"" gun control. Since then, Bastean has been selling up to 30 guns a day, instead of his usual three to five. ""He didn't say much more, but people are so fearful of what he defined as 'common sense,'"" said Bastean. ""They're so fearful that he is going to restrict their rights.""

The progressive movement must grapple with Donald Trump and terrorism simultaneously.
The wake-up call is right there in the front page headline of the New York Times: “Poll Has Trump Gaining Ground on Terror Fear.”
Prior to the tragic burst of terrorist murders in Egypt, Beirut, Paris and then San Bernardino, California, significant aspects of U.S. politics were beginning to move in a positive direction. Pressure from #BlackLivesMatter and Raise the Wage campaigns was forcing issues of racism and economic inequality to the forefront of public debate. Climate change denialism was increasingly on the defensive. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign was giving voice to a broad anti-corporate agenda. And the Republicans seemed to be lurching so far to the right that they might self-isolate or split.
But in the wake of newly revived public fears about terrorism, and the right's orgy of war mongering, Islamophobia and racist demagogy, ""A plurality of the public views the threat of terrorism as the top issue facing the country,"" according to a Dec. 10, 2015 NY Times/CBS poll. “Americans are more fearful about the likelihood of another terrorist attack than at any other time since the weeks after Sept. 11, 2001.""
Given the misery and strife of the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and the powerful influence of ISIS (Daesh in Arabic), repeated Daesh-inspired or Daesh-organized terrorist attacks in the U.S. seem likely. Though limited in scale compared to terrorism in other parts of the world, such attacks do what they are intended to do: attract outsized attention and alarm the public. And, in light of its timing, the San Bernardino attack was not only deadly, but also exposed a potential path to the presidency and control of all three branches of the federal government by the nakedly xenophobic, racist and militarist tendency now utterly dominating the Republican Party. Even a victory by one of the so-called mainstream Republican conservatives would be a calamity with Congress, especially the House, in the hands of far right.
The attacks are also increasing the militarist and law-and-order tendencies of Hillary Clinton and other mainstream Democrats, tendencies that once led them to endorse George W. Bush's disastrous war in Iraq.
This essays calls attention to two crucial developments.
First, over the past six months or so the far right has taken dangerous steps even further to the right. They have legitimized the public expression of blatant racism and authoritarian policies toward Muslims and immigrants. The climate they have created has contributed to the recent shootings targeting Planned Parenthood and BlackLivesMatter protesters and led their supporters to brag about beating up opponents at campaign rallies. Their extremist policies and rhetoric have alarmed even many mainstream commentators, with some pundits even using the term ""fascism."" Yet they are dominating the Republican Party to a greater degree than before and, in significant part due to playing the foreign terrorism card, are also garnering broader public support, threatening to shift the entire political spectrum another notch to the right.
And second, that first development urgently underscores, not for the first time, how crucial it is for social justice organizations to develop a strategy that integrates a sophisticated understanding of the intimate interconnections of war, terrorism, racism and inequality, and between peace and justice at home and abroad, if we are to mature as a major political force. Neglecting the central issues of foreign policy in the world's only superpower is fatally narrowminded and politically self-destructive, especially when there is a direct line between U.S. foreign policy and terrorist actions in our own country. Racism and corporate interests animate our militarized foreign policy; U.S. militarism in turn, fuels racism, xenophobia, and inequality and a disastrous allocation of government resources at home.
Peace and social justice movements need to present a clear and credible explanation of the roots of extremist Islamic terrorism and an alternative path to preventing it. Otherwise, we cede the field to the rightwing on one of the most explosive issues of our time.
Individually, almost all progressives are antiwar. However, precious few of our social justice organizations reflect this in their mission, programs or organizing -- and not enough of our peace organizations regularly cross over to domestic issues. Social justice organizations need to re-strategize.
Republican extremism has intensified the polarization already existing in U.S. politics. There is widespread revulsion at the naked racism of Trump and company. If galvanized by effective progressive action, this revulsion can lead to uniting a wide array of people to roll back the right's momentum.
If we can do the necessary re-strategizing to accomplish this, we can avoid potentially disastrous results in the 2016 election and be in position to build the kind of durable progressive current that is needed well beyond the election.
High Stakes
Most of the progressive movement has failed to concretely address terrorism, leaving the issue to the right and far right, which are exploiting it spectacularly. Perhaps our reluctance is due to justifiable fears of getting trapped into supporting reactionary military adventures, illegal spying or the undermining of civil liberties. We are also now paying a price for failing to sustain the antiwar movement of the early 2000s, and for allowing connections between domestic issues and war and militarism to dim on the radar screens of most sectors of the social justice movement.
But with ISIS/Daesh and others encouraging global networks of supporters and sympathizers to 'take action' wherever they are, we must prepare ourselves politically as well as emotionally for the possibility of more internationally inspired attacks in the U.S. It is important -- but not nearly sufficient -- to point out that, within the U.S., more mass killings are committed by right-wingers and white supremacists than by people claiming inspiration from some strand of Islamic extremism. The origins, purposes and politics of U.S. rightwing terrorism are completely different. We need a clear view of what it will take to radically mitigate the threat of terrorism that arises from Islamic fundamentalism.
The stakes are high: if the rightist narrative about ""jihadi-style"" terrorist incidents wins out, the momentum we have built on domestic social justice issues may be totally reversed. Despite the utter failure of the ""war on terrorism"" since Sept. 11, the right will seek to double down on its most disastrous elements. They will move to reintroduce massive ground troops into the Middle East, move hard against immigrants and Muslims, reinforce racist police brutality and mass incarceration, limit civil liberties, destroy an already-weakened trade union movement, even more drastically restrict abortion rights and access to birth control, impede progress on LGBT rights and gender justice, and crack down on all who oppose their agenda. Via voting rights restrictions, more gerrymandering and naked intimidation, they will seek to institutionalize one-party control of the federal government for a generation or more to come.
The Republican Party already controls 33 governorships and more than 30 state legislatures where they have set in place key elements of their reactionary program. They control both houses of Congress and the federal judiciary and, from Donald Trump and Ted Cruz through Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, their presidential aspirants are using racist fear-mongering and Islamophobia to gain control of all three branches of the federal government and impose their agenda on the entire country.
Fear of terrorism is not limited to the rightwing and its presidential candidates. Much of the base of the Democratic Party, and certainly Hillary Clinton, is also moving rightwards in reaction to Islamic extremist terrorism and, in the absence of a strong progressive pushback, this tendency will likely be accentuated if there are more attacks. Without such a pushback progressives will be exiled to the political margins even should the Democratic nominee (likely Hillary Clinton) win.
Progressives cannot meet these challenges unless we effectively tackle the issue of Daesh-inspired terrorism, among ourselves and in the battle to shape public opinion. The basis to prevail in this fight is present: even among conservatives there is widespread recognition that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were failures. If we can build on that sentiment and effectively explain how terrorist ""blowback"" is directly related to U.S. militarism in the Middle East, we can mount a formidable fightback against the rightwing narrative. (See the Talking Points at the end of this essay for an example.)
The need to address foreign terrorism and unite against the right is not just a short term proposition, pushed to the forefront by this electoral cycle. In a country where the proportion of the white population continues to shrink, and in a world where U.S. economic and political dominance is slowly but surely in decline, the reactionary social base for an appeal to ""Make (white) America Great Again"" is not going to disappear. On the contrary, whatever the outcome of the 2016 elections, the hysterical demand for the use of any and all means to preserve an illusory ""security"" is likely to remain a permanent strand of our politics, producing constant pressure for more wars, more racism and a crackdown on all those resisting the right's agenda.
Though the right's bellicose response to terrorism (including carpet bombing) is being used to mobilize and broaden its base, fighting terrorism is not an inherently rightist position. In response to the gruesome terrorist attacks on trains in Madrid in 2004 which massacred 191 people and injured nearly 2,000, the Spanish people moved to the left, deposed the prime minister and reversed Spain's policy in favor of war in Iraq. Since that time there have been no Paris- or San Bernardino-like terrorist incidents in Spain.
The Current Situation
The dangers of the current situation result from the confluence of at least the following main developments:
1) The ongoing Western interventions, civil wars, power conflicts between Middle Eastern governments, reactionary dictatorships, and ethnic and sectarian fighting have intensified and there is no end in sight. Death, misery, starvation and migration are the orders of the day for tens of millions of people. Desperation and hatred of the West roil the region. No less than eight countries and numerous ethnic, religious and political factions are involved in the tragedy of Syria, the conflict which has most recently contributed to intensified military action, the growth of terrorism, mass migration and despair.
2) IS/ISIS/ISIL/Daesh (four names for the same entity) has emerged from the militarized misery now afflicting the Middle East with far greater power than any (non-state) terrorist group of the last 40 years, and the recent attacks show that they are now actively pursuing an international strategy.
Daesh's leadership has its origins as part of al-Qaeda in the war in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989 where the U.S. helped recruit, organize and train them to fight the Soviets. After the Soviet defeat the terrorists trained their guns on the often corrupt and authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and on the West. They gained new life and momentum in response to the U.S. wars in Iraq and the Middle East in 1991 and since September 11.
In 2012 Daesh formed from a split with al-Qaeda. Due to the U.S.'s fatal construction and backing of a sectarian Shiite regime in Iraq and that regime's sharp attacks on the Sunnis, ISIS/Daesh was able to recruit segments of Saddam Hussein's regime (Sunni political and military leaders) as well as Sunni tribal chiefs, and to win economic and political support from some of the former Iraqi ruling classes and social base.
Daesh now controls swaths of land, economy and population, including significant oil areas in Iraq and Syria, and is trying to move into and recruit in Libya. Their military capacity now rests on this economy and political support and is greatly bolstered by the expertise of many of the battle hardened generals and command staff of Saddam Hussein's army. Their influence extends into Africa, West and South Asia, and Europe.
Their goals are utterly reactionary: the establishment of a theocratic dictatorship (Caliphate) premised on a brutally hierarchical and patriarchal version of Islam that runs counter to that of the overwhelming majority of Muslims. Unless they (and other terrorist groups) are defeated, or at least seriously undermined, many in the region will suffer and it is hard to imagine that terrorist attacks in the U.S. and elsewhere will not continue and possibly grow more frequent and more intense. The attacks in Boston and San Bernardino appear to have been carried out by people who supported and were inspired by extreme Islamic terror groups but whose attacks were not directed or organized by any group. It is not clear whether ISIS has attained organized operational capacity in the U.S., but it seems a likely goal  --  the prevention of which is a high priority.
3) In the U.S. the political atmosphere is pervaded by mass shootings (often racist or misogynist in motivation), racist police murders and the terrorist attacks internationally, but also in Boston and now San Bernardino. It has recently been revealed that, on average, there is a mass shooting in which four or more people are shot every single day in the U.S. The New York Times reports that ""Since Sept. 11, 2001, nearly twice as many people have been killed by white supremacists, antigovernment fanatics and other non-Muslim extremists than by radical Muslims.""
Until the recent spike in foreign terrorist attacks it seemed that the antiracist forces, spearheaded by #BlackLivesMatter and mobilizing against state violence, were gaining important momentum, and that the rightwing might isolate itself with its bombastic rhetoric. But the Islamic extremist terrorist attacks are providing a basis for the rightwing to reinvigorate their call for a hard militarist/police line against all who they brand as ""criminals,"" domestic or foreign.
The racist far right has been seething since the election of the country's first Black president. It is enraged by what is sees as recent attacks on the police and law and order by #BlackLivesMatter and criminal justice reformers. And now their wrath has been energized by the ultra-right presidential candidates and the prospects of a new ""war on terrorism at home and abroad.""
4) The populist rightwing in the U.S. has moved another big step to the right in the last six months. The contemporary populist far right coalesced in the racist backlash to the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, especially in the white South. It was greatly expanded by white flight suburban tax revolts and the white middle and working classes whose former stability and hopes were destroyed by deindustrialization, corporate globalization and economic polarization beginning in the 1970s.
Rather than identifying corporate capital as culpable for their plight, those that moved to the far right instead blame people of color and immigrants to the U.S. for ""stealing their jobs."" They fear that the steadily increasing proportion of voters of color means that white people will be relegated to second class citizenship. From their vantage point, people of color at home and abroad are also responsible for the declining power of the U.S. on the world scene. They see themselves as righteous soldiers in the fight to save white power within the U.S. and in the world.
(A somewhat similar process in much of Europe is underway in which openly fascist parties are manipulating the immigration issue to gain impressive support and power.)
There is no end in sight to the demographic, economic and political changes that the right so powerfully rejects. The increase of people of color, especially in the electorate, is one of the main bases for confidence that progressives can prevail if we refuse to self-isolate and instead throw ourselves into mass politics. And the historic level of economic inequality, while painful, also presents us with a tremendous organizing opportunity for the future.
Before the latest terrorist attacks this new level of extremism looked like it might cause a more open and politically significant split between different far right factions and between the far right and the conservatives in the Republican Party. But terrorist attacks within the U.S.–and the prospect of riding public anxiety about them to total control of the federal government–might strengthen their common cause.
On the other hand, a powerful progressive public response can aggravate splits within the right which are a necessary condition for their defeat. Among other things, it is imperative, not optional, that progressives, especially whites, do the hard work of organizing among the many whites, including economically depressed white workers, who are now attracted to the far right. We cannot stay holed up in Blue bastions and cede the rest of the country to the tender mercies of the right.
The presidential election has elevated all of these developments, providing hyped-up media platforms and massive audiences for the most irresponsible and reckless political rhetoric and one-upmanship, but also for well-organized progressive forces.
Progressive Response to Terrorism 
In response to Islamophobia many progressives have moved to express solidarity with the Muslim community in the U.S., and this is, of course, essential. Likewise, antiwar organizations are striving to re-energize and get a wider hearing. But these steps alone are not sufficient to answer the right's drive toward war and incitement of racism and xenophobia. Progressives that are focused on domestic issues or climate change must now find a way to incorporate a response to terrorism into our ongoing work, as well as respond quickly and powerfully to specific events as they unfold.
Of course this is easier said than done. Social justice organizations are already overloaded with tasks. Moreover the barriers between domestic social justice work and international peace and solidarity work are formidable. Foundation funding has given these divisions a structure and financial basis. Precious few social justice organizations threw resources against the recent Iraq war, even though opposition to it was tremendous among members and staffers. And though a breakthrough was achieved when, for the first time in its history the AFL-CIO came out against a U.S. military action abroad by opposing the bombing of Iraq, most unions were unwilling or unable to link militarism to domestic economic inequality or to put the kind of resources into antiwar education and organizing that would have prepared their members for a long haul fight against U.S. militarism.
But now practical domestic politics force us to make a renewed and more successful attempt to tackle this shortcoming. Though it will be a difficult shift, it is crucial for social justice organizations to begin to integrate the struggle for peace and against terrorism into their basic vision, values and programs.
Here are some thoughts about how we might meet this challenge.
1) Name and highlight the struggles for peace and security, and against violence in our domestic social justice work. The struggle for peace and security and against violence are both a condition of and inherent in every social justice issue: on the job, in our communities and schools, in our homes and for our environment. Large segments of the U.S. population, most especially but not limited to poor communities of color, suffer from violence on a daily basis. Opposition to state, racist, intra-community, religiously motivated and domestic violence should be integral to our fundamental values, programs and communications, linking our struggles for social justice to the struggle for peace and security, and against terrorism.
2) Understand that the fight against racism cannot be won just by struggling around domestic issues. Similarly, international peace cannot be won without a struggle against racism in the U.S. U.S. wars are largely rationalized by racism -- the dehumanization and demonizing of people into enemies on the basis of their color or culture to the point of justifying their mass murder and the violent crushing of their economies, homes, public health and schools. The struggle against racism and for peace are potently linked and this needs to be reflected in our strategies and organizing.
Every dollar spent on war and militarism is a dollar robbed from improving social and economic conditions at home and abroad. The civil rights movement and the war on poverty in the 1960s were hugely undermined by massive spending on the Vietnam War. The continuous wars in the Middle East are sucking the resources that should be used to improve the quality of life in the U.S. and abroad. Fear of terrorism can quickly give rise to racist criminalization of Muslims and people of color at home. The military-industrial-prison-police complex is a major rightwing force in politics and in action. The cost of U.S. wars ""against terrorism"" -- about $4 trillion since Sept. 11 and $7.5 billion just to fight ISIS/Daesh  --  should be a constant theme in our mobilizing for social programs at home.
The fight against war and militarism is a fight for peace and security at home. Reckless wars and conflicts we cause abroad may cause some of our opponents to strike us at home. The world has shrunk and become more interconnected than ever. We cannot bury our heads in the sand like isolationists. We must become knowledgeable international anti-racists dedicated to peace, non-intervention, self-determination, equality and a steadily improving quality of life for all peoples.
3) Project our outright opposition to terrorism from any source, and to Daesh in particular. There is no political or religious justification for the random murder of innocent people, or their reactionary, dictatorial, patriarchal agenda.
Unfortunately, given the momentum of forces devoted to terrorism in the name of Islam, we are likely to confront this form of terrorism for some time to come. Nonetheless, the defeat of terrorism cannot be accomplished primarily by military means. It will take steadfast international coalition-building, a strong democratic motion among the peoples of the Middle East, massive aid to improve the lives of the people, skillful diplomacy and many other forms of struggle.
It will require a massive shift in the fundamentals of U.S. foreign policy principles, particularly moving away from a military-first foreign policy to one based on international law, human rights and equality for all.
It will likely take some time to build the kind of democratic motion and international coalition that is required. Most of the democratic minded forces in the Middle East have been massacred in the last three decades by a deadly combination of Western imperialism, Israeli attacks, reactionary government repression and terrorist groups. Among other things we must end the U.S. blank check support of Israel, which is a constant source of anti-west sentiment.
And what about a U.S. military role? There may be rare situations where we would consider supporting some U.S. action: for instance, providing assistance to democratic forces who are facing ISIS/Daesh on the ground. Or participating in some coalition led by peoples of the region that has been sanctioned by the United Nations and follows international law. Even these possibilities are dicey given the history of U.S. 'mission creep.'
Progressives might well disagree with each other on the specifics of each particular case. But dealing with an exceptional case where a U.S. military role might be warranted is not our problem today. Rather we are faced with the uphill task of stopping the current use of substantial military force, from special operations to drones to flooding the region with arms to backing brutal reactionary regimes such as Saudi Arabia–as well as staving off the escalation of military action demanded by every Republican and some Democratic presidential candidates.
We will also need to combat the rightwing illusion that perfect security is achievable. No amount of military action abroad or surveillance at home can completely prevent the occasional eruption of violence or terrorist attacks motivated by reactionary religious fundamentalism. We need to challenge the simpleminded reduction of safety and security to ending terrorism–to the exclusion of good jobs, housing, equality and justice, peace in our neighborhoods and homes, and environmental sustainability.
4) Combat racist Islamophobia and immigrant bashing; defend basic civil liberties and multicultural democracy. We should more purposefully and regularly promote strong relationships, understanding and common cause among people of different faiths, ethnicities, sexual identities and racial groups in the course of fighting for social justice. Multiculturalism is not just for mushy liberals; it is a crucial necessity for winning racial justice and building a democratic society. If terrorist attacks continue, the right's unconstitutional proposals to repress Muslims and immigrants will increase and possibly resonate much further.
Final Thoughts
The danger of continued foreign terrorist attacks is clear and present as is the urgency of a strong social justice movement that can help build a wide and powerful anti-right alliance for 2016 and beyond. Terrorism, the far right run amok and the possibility of strong rightward moves by mainstream Democrats underscore the need for progressives to make a big turn: to both broaden our social justice agenda to peace and safety at home as well as abroad, and to strengthen our attention and link all issues to the leading edges of struggle: war and racism. This will not be a quick or easy process, but it is a necessary one if we are to emerge as a significant force for social progress and against the right.
The 2016 election season has already been a donnybrook, replete with unexpected twists and turns. Now foreign terrorist attacks, and the prospect of more, have thrust an explosive dynamic into U.S. politics, electoral and non-electoral. The far right has radicalized another notch and ratcheted up its bellicose and racist rhetoric. It is implicitly sanctioning  --  sometimes outright encouraging–both police and vigilante violence against opponents. Still the far right has deepened its domination of the Republican Party, gained a broader hearing from the public than ever, and pulled the whole political spectrum to the right. The result is that it is now possible to glimpse a potential path for an extremist Republican to win the White House. And it is also possible to envision scenarios where a ""mainstream conservative Republican"" or Democrat will escalate U.S. military involvement in the Middle East (or Asia) with disastrous results, especially since Congress is firmly in the hands of the Republicans.
But political polarizations don't always produce the results that demagogues intend. The U.S. public is scared of ISIS-linked terrorism, but it is also weary of ground wars in the Middle East and worried about the economic future of their families. Much of the public is appalled by the naked bigotry and sheer dishonesty of the far right. Progressives can tap into these sentiments and appeal to peoples' ""better angels"" as well as their better judgement if we can craft a clear and inter-linked foreign and domestic political program and message.
We will need to learn by doing. If we can stay at it through our inevitable mistakes and shortcomings, we could become a real factor in 2016 and make strides toward building the program, strategy and alliances necessary to become a force to be reckoned with now and in the future.

Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution

More AMERICAN POLITICS ... The progressive movement must grapple with Donald Trump and terrorism simultaneously.

In response to the gruesome terrorist attacks on trains in Madrid in 2004 which massacred 191 people and injured nearly 2,000, the Spanish people moved to the left, deposed the prime minister and reversed Spain's policy in favor of war in Iraq. Since that time there have been no Paris- or San Bernardino-like terrorist incidents in Spain. The Current Situation The dangers of the current situation result from the confluence of at least the following main developments: 1) The ongoing Western interventions, civil wars, power conflicts between Middle Eastern governments, reactionary dictatorships, and ethnic and sectarian fighting have intensified and there is no end in sight. Death, misery, starvation and migration are the orders of the day for tens of millions of people. Desperation and hatred of the West roil the region. No less than eight countries and numerous ethnic, religious and political factions are involved in the tragedy of Syria, the conflict which has most recently contributed to intensified military action, the growth of terrorism, mass migration and despair. 2) IS/ISIS/ISIL/Daesh (four names for the same entity) has emerged from the militarized misery now afflicting the Middle East with far greater power than any (non-state) terrorist group of the last 40 years, and the recent attacks show that they are now actively pursuing an international strategy. Daesh's leadership has its origins as part of al-Qaeda in the war in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989 where the U.S. helped recruit, organize and train them to fight the Soviets. After the Soviet defeat the terrorists trained their guns on the often corrupt and authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and on the West. They gained new life and momentum in response to the U.S. wars in Iraq and the Middle East in 1991 and since September 11. In 2012 Daesh formed from a split with al-Qaeda. Due to the U.S.'s fatal construction and backing of a sectarian Shiite regime in Iraq and that regime's sharp attacks on the Sunnis, ISIS/Daesh was able to recruit segments of Saddam Hussein's regime (Sunni political and military leaders) as well as Sunni tribal chiefs, and to win economic and political support from some of the former Iraqi ruling classes and social base. Daesh now controls swaths of land, economy and population, including significant oil areas in Iraq and Syria, and is trying to move into and recruit in Libya. Their military capacity now rests on this economy and political support and is greatly bolstered by the expertise of many of the battle hardened generals and command staff of Saddam Hussein's army. Their influence extends into Africa, West and South Asia, and Europe. Their goals are utterly reactionary: the establishment of a theocratic dictatorship (Caliphate) premised on a brutally hierarchical and patriarchal version of Islam that runs counter to that of the overwhelming majority of Muslims. Unless they (and other terrorist groups) are defeated, or at least seriously undermined, many in the region will suffer and it is hard to imagine that terrorist attacks in the U.S. and elsewhere will not continue and possibly grow more frequent and more intense. The attacks in Boston and San Bernardino appear to have been carried out by people who supported and were inspired by extreme Islamic terror groups but whose attacks were not directed or organized by any group. It is not clear whether ISIS has attained organized operational capacity in the U.S., but it seems a likely goal  --  the prevention of which is a high priority. 3) In the U.S. the political atmosphere is pervaded by mass shootings (often racist or misogynist in motivation), racist police murders and the terrorist attacks internationally, but also in Boston and now San Bernardino. It has recently been revealed that, on average, there is a mass shooting in which four or more people are shot every single day in the U.S. The New York Times reports that ""Since Sept. 11, 2001, nearly twice as many people have been killed by white supremacists, antigovernment fanatics and other non-Muslim extremists than by radical Muslims."" Until the recent spike in foreign terrorist attacks it seemed that the antiracist forces, spearheaded by #BlackLivesMatter and mobilizing against state violence, were gaining important momentum, and that the rightwing might isolate itself with its bombastic rhetoric. But the Islamic extremist terrorist attacks are providing a basis for the rightwing to reinvigorate their call for a hard militarist/police line against all who they brand as ""criminals,"" domestic or foreign. The racist far right has been seething since the election of the country's first Black president. It is enraged by what is sees as recent attacks on the police and law and order by #BlackLivesMatter and criminal justice reformers. And now their wrath has been energized by the ultra-right presidential candidates and the prospects of a new ""war on terrorism at home and abroad."" 4) The populist rightwing in the U.S. has moved another big step to the right in the last six months. The contemporary populist far right coalesced in the racist backlash to the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, especially in the white South. It was greatly expanded by white flight suburban tax revolts and the white middle and working classes whose former stability and hopes were destroyed by deindustrialization, corporate globalization and economic polarization beginning in the 1970s. Rather than identifying corporate capital as culpable for their plight, those that moved to the far right instead blame people of color and immigrants to the U.S. for ""stealing their jobs."" They fear that the steadily increasing proportion of voters of color means that white people will be relegated to second class citizenship. From their vantage point, people of color at home and abroad are also responsible for the declining power of the U.S. on the world scene. They see themselves as righteous soldiers in the fight to save white power within the U.S. and in the world. (A somewhat similar process in much of Europe is underway in which openly fascist parties are manipulating the immigration issue to gain impressive support and power.) There is no end in sight to the demographic, economic and political changes that the right so powerfully rejects. The increase of people of color, especially in the electorate, is one of the main bases for confidence that progressives can prevail if we refuse to self-isolate and instead throw ourselves into mass politics. And the historic level of economic inequality, while painful, also presents us with a tremendous organizing opportunity for the future. Before the latest terrorist attacks this new level of extremism looked like it might cause a more open and politically significant split between different far right factions and between the far right and the conservatives in the Republican Party. But terrorist attacks within the U.S.–and the prospect of riding public anxiety about them to total control of the federal government–might strengthen their common cause. On the other hand, a powerful progressive public response can aggravate splits within the right which are a necessary condition for their defeat. Among other things, it is imperative, not optional, that progressives, especially whites, do the hard work of organizing among the many whites, including economically depressed white workers, who are now attracted to the far right. We cannot stay holed up in Blue bastions and cede the rest of the country to the tender mercies of the right. The presidential election has elevated all of these developments, providing hyped-up media platforms and massive audiences for the most irresponsible and reckless political rhetoric and one-upmanship, but also for well-organized progressive forces. Progressive Response to Terrorism In response to Islamophobia many progressives have moved to express solidarity with the Muslim community in the U.S., and this is, of course, essential. Likewise, antiwar organizations are striving to re-energize and get a wider hearing. But these steps alone are not sufficient to answer the right's drive toward war and incitement of racism and xenophobia. Progressives that are focused on domestic issues or climate change must now find a way to incorporate a response to terrorism into our ongoing work, as well as respond quickly and powerfully to specific events as they unfold. Of course this is easier said than done. Social justice organizations are already overloaded with tasks. Moreover the barriers between domestic social justice work and international peace and solidarity work are formidable. Foundation funding has given these divisions a structure and financial basis. Precious few social justice organizations threw resources against the recent Iraq war, even though opposition to it was tremendous among members and staffers. And though a breakthrough was achieved when, for the first time in its history the AFL-CIO came out against a U.S. military action abroad by opposing the bombing of Iraq, most unions were unwilling or unable to link militarism to domestic economic inequality or to put the kind of resources into antiwar education and organizing that would have prepared their members for a long haul fight against U.S. militarism. But now practical domestic politics force us to make a renewed and more successful attempt to tackle this shortcoming. Though it will be a difficult shift, it is crucial for social justice organizations to begin to integrate the struggle for peace and against terrorism into their basic vision, values and programs. Here are some thoughts about how we might meet this challenge. 1) Name and highlight the struggles for peace and security, and against violence in our domestic social justice work. The struggle for peace and security and against violence are both a condition of and inherent in every social justice issue: on the job, in our communities and schools, in our homes and for our environment. Large segments of the U.S. population, most especially but not limited to poor communities of color, suffer from violence on a daily basis. Opposition to state, racist, intra-community, religiously motivated and domestic violence should be integral to our fundamental values, programs and communications, linking our struggles for social justice to the struggle for peace and security, and against terrorism. 2) Understand that the fight against racism cannot be won just by struggling around domestic issues. Similarly, international peace cannot be won without a struggle against racism in the U.S. U.S. wars are largely rationalized by racism -- the dehumanization and demonizing of people into enemies on the basis of their color or culture to the point of justifying their mass murder and the violent crushing of their economies, homes, public health and schools. The struggle against racism and for peace are potently linked and this needs to be reflected in our strategies and organizing. Every dollar spent on war and militarism is a dollar robbed from improving social and economic conditions at home and abroad. The civil rights movement and the war on poverty in the 1960s were hugely undermined by massive spending on the Vietnam War. The continuous wars in the Middle East are sucking the resources that should be used to improve the quality of life in the U.S. and abroad. Fear of terrorism can quickly give rise to racist criminalization of Muslims and people of color at home. The military-industrial-prison-police complex is a major rightwing force in politics and in action. The cost of U.S. wars ""against terrorism"" -- about $4 trillion since Sept. 11 and $7.5 billion just to fight ISIS/Daesh  --  should be a constant theme in our mobilizing for social programs at home. The fight against war and militarism is a fight for peace and security at home. Reckless wars and conflicts we cause abroad may cause some of our opponents to strike us at home. The world has shrunk and become more interconnected than ever. We cannot bury our heads in the sand like isolationists. We must become knowledgeable international anti-racists dedicated to peace, non-intervention, self-determination, equality and a steadily improving quality of life for all peoples. 3) Project our outright opposition to terrorism from any source, and to Daesh in particular. There is no political or religious justification for the random murder of innocent people, or their reactionary, dictatorial, patriarchal agenda. Unfortunately, given the momentum of forces devoted to terrorism in the name of Islam, we are likely to confront this form of terrorism for some time to come. Nonetheless, the defeat of terrorism cannot be accomplished primarily by military means. It will take steadfast international coalition-building, a strong democratic motion among the peoples of the Middle East, massive aid to improve the lives of the people, skillful diplomacy and many other forms of struggle. It will require a massive shift in the fundamentals of U.S. foreign policy principles, particularly moving away from a military-first foreign policy to one based on international law, human rights and equality for all. It will likely take some time to build the kind of democratic motion and international coalition that is required. Most of the democratic minded forces in the Middle East have been massacred in the last three decades by a deadly combination of Western imperialism, Israeli attacks, reactionary government repression and terrorist groups. Among other things we must end the U.S. blank check support of Israel, which is a constant source of anti-west sentiment. And what about a U.S. military role? There may be rare situations where we would consider supporting some U.S. action: for instance, providing assistance to democratic forces who are facing ISIS/Daesh on the ground. Or participating in some coalition led by peoples of the region that has been sanctioned by the United Nations and follows international law. Even these possibilities are dicey given the history of U.S. 'mission creep.' Progressives might well disagree with each other on the specifics of each particular case. But dealing with an exceptional case where a U.S. military role might be warranted is not our problem today. Rather we are faced with the uphill task of stopping the current use of substantial military force, from special operations to drones to flooding the region with arms to backing brutal reactionary regimes such as Saudi Arabia–as well as staving off the escalation of military action demanded by every Republican and some Democratic presidential candidates. We will also need to combat the rightwing illusion that perfect security is achievable. No amount of military action abroad or surveillance at home can completely prevent the occasional eruption of violence or terrorist attacks motivated by reactionary religious fundamentalism. We need to challenge the simpleminded reduction of safety and security to ending terrorism–to the exclusion of good jobs, housing, equality and justice, peace in our neighborhoods and homes, and environmental sustainability. 4) Combat racist Islamophobia and immigrant bashing; defend basic civil liberties and multicultural democracy. We should more purposefully and regularly promote strong relationships, understanding and common cause among people of different faiths, ethnicities, sexual identities and racial groups in the course of fighting for social justice. Multiculturalism is not just for mushy liberals; it is a crucial necessity for winning racial justice and building a democratic society. If terrorist attacks continue, the right's unconstitutional proposals to repress Muslims and immigrants will increase and possibly resonate much further. Final Thoughts The danger of continued foreign terrorist attacks is clear and present as is the urgency of a strong social justice movement that can help build a wide and powerful anti-right alliance for 2016 and beyond. Terrorism, the far right run amok and the possibility of strong rightward moves by mainstream Democrats underscore the need for progressives to make a big turn: to both broaden our social justice agenda to peace and safety at home as well as abroad, and to strengthen our attention and link all issues to the leading edges of struggle: war and racism. This will not be a quick or easy process, but it is a necessary one if we are to emerge as a significant force for social progress and against the right. The 2016 election season has already been a donnybrook, replete with unexpected twists and turns. Now foreign terrorist attacks, and the prospect of more, have thrust an explosive dynamic into U.S. politics, electoral and non-electoral. The far right has radicalized another notch and ratcheted up its bellicose and racist rhetoric. It is implicitly sanctioning  --  sometimes outright encouraging–both police and vigilante violence against opponents. Still the far right has deepened its domination of the Republican Party, gained a broader hearing from the public than ever, and pulled the whole political spectrum to the right. The result is that it is now possible to glimpse a potential path for an extremist Republican to win the White House. And it is also possible to envision scenarios where a ""mainstream conservative Republican"" or Democrat will escalate U.S. military involvement in the Middle East (or Asia) with disastrous results, especially since Congress is firmly in the hands of the Republicans. But political polarizations don't always produce the results that demagogues intend. The U.S. public is scared of ISIS-linked terrorism, but it is also weary of ground wars in the Middle East and worried about the economic future of their families. Much of the public is appalled by the naked bigotry and sheer dishonesty of the far right. Progressives can tap into these sentiments and appeal to peoples' ""better angels"" as well as their better judgement if we can craft a clear and inter-linked foreign and domestic political program and message. We will need to learn by doing. If we can stay at it through our inevitable mistakes and shortcomings, we could become a real factor in 2016 and make strides toward building the program, strategy and alliances necessary to become a force to be reckoned with now and in the future.

408,https://newsone.com/3316847/news-roundup-obama-town-hall-on-gun-control-and-more/,"Posted January 4, 2016 President Obama will tackle issues surrounding gun control in our country during a televised town hall-style meeting on Thursday. The event, “Guns in America,” is being hosted by CNN and will air a day before the fifth anniversary of the shooting that left Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords in critical condition. During the program, President Obama is slated to talk about the negative impact that gun violence has had on our country and will take questions from attendees. There have been talks that the president is planning to take executive actions that would strengthen background checks. The executive order, which might possibly be put in place sometime this month, is expected to be strongly opposed by Republican representatives. “We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world,” said President Obama following the mass shooting that took place in San Bernardino. “Guns in America” is slated to air on Thursday at 8:30 p.m. EST on CNN.

Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige confirmed that he would be coming on board in a recent interview. Feige also shared that the cast will primarily be African-American. “This one is important … Not only do you get an unbelievable lead character, but you also get all of Wakanda which is a whole new setting and culture to explore … The movie is a big geopolitical action adventure that focuses on the family and royal struggle of T’Challa in Wakanda and what it means to be a king,” said Feige. Coogler, who is 29-years-old, is best known for his work on Fruitvale Station. Black Panther is slated to be released July 6, 2018. Read more. Beyoncé to Write and Star in Film about Saartjie Baartman Beyoncé is always challenging herself. After solidifying a top spot in the music industry, she’s now looking to make her mark in the realm of film. According to reports, Bey will pen and star in a biopic based on the life of Saartjie Baartman; a South African woman who was forced to participate in “freak shows” during the 1800s because of her curves. Baartman is symbolic to the exploitation and abuse of African-American women’s physiques. Even after her death, Baartman’s body was still put on display at the Musée de l’Homme in Paris. Her remains stayed on display until feminists fought to have them removed from the museum and buried. “Beyonce is desperate to be taken seriously as an actress. Even though she’s had a string of well-received movies, she still feels her breakthrough role is yet to come,” said a source. “She now wants to write a screenplay that gains her respect — and hopefully awards — from the film industry, and thinks Saartjie’s story could be her ticket.” Read more.

409,http://www.ocregister.com/articles/center-698371-county-attack.html,"Trending:  The Inland Regional Center's two buildings not involved in the Dec. 2 mass shooting in San Bernardino are scheduled to re-open for regular business on Monday, Jan. 4  A police helicopter hovers around the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino following the Dec. 2 mass shooting that left 14 dead and 22 wounded. Two buildings at the center will be reopened Monday, Jan. 4.  Enrique Marquez, 24, who authorities say bought the assault rifles his friend used in the San Bernardino massacre, faces terrorism charges this week in Riverside federal court.  One month after the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, San Bernardino starts its new year both with reminders of the tragedy that left 14 dead and 22 wounded, and small steps toward normalcy. The week begins with the reopening of some buildings in the complex where the massacre took place; a private ceremony to honor the victims, which Gov. Jerry Brown and California Attorney General Kamala Harris will attend; and court proceedings for the man charged with buying the rifles used in the attack. And in a sign that things are returning as close to normal as possible, the City Council’s agenda for Monday, Jan. 4 deals with the ongoing business of San Bernardino’s bankruptcy. INLAND REGIONAL CENTER The Inland Regional Center on Waterman Avenue is scheduled Monday to reopen the two buildings not directly involved in the attack. Doors and windows had to be repaired on the buildings. They were damaged when law enforcement officers entered, looking for shooters and victims. Those are the buildings where the center does its work, including assessing people with developmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy and autism and connecting them with organizations that offer therapy and other services. A third building, where the attack took place, will stay closed indefinitely. Officials for the center said there will be discussions about what to do with it. It includes a coffee shop, library and conference facilities that can be rented out for events. The day of the attack, San Bernardino County environmental health workers were using the facility for a training session and holiday party. Since the shootings, center employees have been working remotely. The center’s Riverside field office on Iowa Avenue was closed following the shootings because center officials wanted to handle all facilities in the same way and at the same time. That location will reopen Monday. MEMORIAL FOR WORKERS San Bernardino County employees will gather at 2 p.m. Monday to remember those lost in the attack. The memorial, which is open only to county employees and invited guests including the governor and attorney general, will take place at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario. County offices will close at noon to allow employees to attend. Most of those killed and wounded in the mass shooting worked for the county public health department. MARQUEZ IN COURT Enrique Marquez Jr. of Riverside is due in Riverside federal court Wednesday for arraignment on a five-count indictment brought against him Dec. 30 by a grand jury. Marquez, 24, is the only person charged in connection with the shooting. He has not entered a plea, but will likely do so at this appearance. The indictment charges Marquez with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists; two counts of making a false statement during the purchase of assault-style rifles used in the Dec. 2 shooting; marriage fraud; and making a false statement on immigration paperwork in relation to an alleged sham marriage. The FBI has said Marquez did not participate or know about the Dec. 2 attacks, but in 2011 and 2012 he bought the two assault rifles used by Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik in the shootings. The two died a few hours later in a shootout with police. The government also said it was during that same time frame that Marquez bought the explosive powder used in bombs Farook left at the center. The devices failed to detonate. Contact the writer: rdeatley@pe.com or 951-368-9573 Get the latest news delivered daily!

The First Lady’s box at the State of the Union is the presidential version of Captain Planet: each guest reflects a different facet of the president’s policy goals for the coming year, and when they all join together, they represent an entire year’s worth of policy goals. With this being Barack Obama’s last State of the Union, the final list of V.I.P.’s set to sit with Michelle Obama on Tuesday night is naturally overflowing with meaning and compelling, if not politically expedient, stories. As such, Obama has had to choose the most poignant people with the most tear-jerking tales. In anticipation of the C-SPAN cameras panning to them upon being mentioned in the address, it doesn’t hurt to be easy on the eyes, either. Here, [according to a list released by the White House]((https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/01/10/meet-guests-first-ladys-2016-state-union-box), are some of the beautiful people chosen by the president to comprise his human platform: An Empty Chair This chair will remain empty to symbolize the lives lost to gun violence—accidents, murders, mass shootings, and suicides—which he hopes to end by enacting reform limiting gun purchases. (Expect Fox News commentators to crack jokes about how someone forgot to attend the State of the Union.) Jim Obergefell The plaintiff in the landmark case that legalized gay marriage, Obergefell became the face of the gay-rights movement after he filed a lawsuit to be listed on his husband’s death certificate as his husband. Satya Nadella Microsoft’s C.E.O. landed himself a spot in the First Lady’s box for his commitment to bringing technology and computer-science programs to American public schools. The White House also highlighted the tech giant’s new family-leave policies, which grants up to 20 weeks of paid leave to new parents. Braeden Mannering By tradition, a Very Adorable Child must be in the First Lady’s box during the State of the Union address. This year, the honor goes to the 12-year-old Mannering, who started his own nonprofit to address food insecurity in impoverished communities, a key part of the Obamas’ Let’s Move! program, embodied by a precious little boy. Refaai Hamo A former engineer, Hamo was one of millions of refugees who fled the violence in Syria. Hamo ended up, after years of turmoil and migration, in Troy, Michigan. His story landed him on the Humans of New York Facebook page, and Obama, whose administration approved 10,000 refugees to enter the United States, personally welcomed him to the country via a Facebook comment. (Several Republican governors and legislators fought against his order, saying that the State Department could not guarantee that these refugees were not secretly terrorists.) Edith Childs Back in 2008, a fresh-faced Obama would be greeted at campaigns with the chant “Fired up! Ready to go!” Edith Childs is the woman who invented that unofficial slogan, and her presence at Obama’s final State of the Union address brings the whole improbably journey full-circle. Spencer Stone The Air Force sergeant was one of three American men who prevented a mass shooting on a Paris train earlier in 2015, subduing a would-be terrorist armed with an assault rifle meaning to kill dozens of people. For his efforts, he received the Purple Heart and a personal commendation from the president. Cedric Rowland A navigator for a Chicago health-care service, Rowland was invited to the First Lady’s box for “helping Americans enroll in quality, affordable health care under the Affordable Care Act.” Yes, people are employed full-time to help other people choose the right health insurance. Health insurance is hard. Despite all these compelling stories, Obama will have to struggle with a public more engrossed in the presidential-election psychodrama than they are with his swan song, as well as the fact that presidents don’t really see any increase in popularity due to the State of the Union address: View on Twitter By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

President Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address struck a hopeful note on Tuesday night, as the nation’s 44th president listed his accomplishments and looked past the end of his term to deliver prescriptions for a better day. Some of his harshest words, however, were pointed at the rhetoric underpinning Donald Trump’s campaign for the Republican nomination. After citing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay as “a recruitment brochure for our enemies,” Obama directed his oratory at Trump—whom he did not need to name: “That’s why we need to reject any politics that targets people because
of race or religion. This isn’t a matter of political correctness.
It’s a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world
respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity
and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness,
Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that
“to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the
best way to take their place.” When politicians insult Muslims, when a
mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn’t make us safer.
That’s not telling it like it is. It’s just wrong. It diminishes us in
the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it
betrays who we are as a country.” Trump wasn’t the only Republican candidate to draw the president’s repudiation. “The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians,” Obama said, referencing Senator Ted Cruz’s proposed solutions to unrest in the Middle East. “That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn’t pass muster on the world stage.” Later in the speech, Obama returned to once again criticize Trump-style rhetoric.  “As frustration grows,” he said, “there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.” Trump largely avoided live-tweeting Obama’s speech, though he did send out a couple of messages. One criticized the Iranian nuclear deal (somewhat bizarrely—Trump’s beef this time is that uranium was sent to Russia, not the U.S.). The other was typically Trumpian in the way it leaned on detailed policy points to make a compelling argument. View on Twitter Yeah, just kidding. It was as vacuous as the rest of his campaign.

 From the February 2016 issue ""There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America,"" President Barack Obama proclaimed after the October mass shooting that killed 10 at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. ""So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work—or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns—is not borne out by the evidence."" In this single brief statement, Obama tidily listed the major questions bedeviling social science research about guns—while also embodying the biggest problem with the way we process and apply that research. The president's ironclad confidence in the conclusiveness of the science, and therefore the desirability of ""common-sense gun safety laws,"" is echoed widely with every new mass shooting, from academia to the popular press to that guy you knew from high school on Facebook. In April 2015, the Harvard gun-violence researcher David Hemenway took to the pages of the Los Angeles Times to declare in a headline: ""There's scientific consensus on guns—and the NRA won't like it."" Hemenway insisted that researchers have definitively established ""that a gun in the home makes it a more dangerous place to be…that guns are not used in self-defense far more often than they are used in crime…and that the change to more permissive gun carrying laws has not reduced crime rates."" He concludes: ""There is consensus that strong gun laws reduce homicide."" But the science is a lot less certain than that. What we really know about the costs and benefits of private gun ownership and the efficacy of gun laws is far more fragile than what Hemenway and the president would have us believe. More guns do not necessarily mean more homicides. More gun laws do not necessarily mean less gun crime. Finding good science is hard enough; finding good social science on a topic so fraught with politics is nigh impossible. The facts then become even more muddled as the conclusions of those less-than-ironclad academic studies cycle through the press and social media in a massive game of telephone. Despite the confident assertions of the gun controllers and decades of research, we still know astonishingly little about how guns actually function in society and almost nothing at all about whether gun control policies actually work as promised. Do More Guns Mean More Homicides? ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history,"" New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote on August 26, 2015, just after the grisly on-air murder of two television journalists in Virginia. It's a startling fact, and true. But do the number of guns in circulation correlate with the number of gun deaths? Start by looking at the category of gun death that propels all gun policy discussion: homicides. (Gun suicides, discussed further below, are a separate matter whose frequent conflation with gun crime introduces much confusion into the debate.) In 1994 Americans owned around 192 million guns, according to the U.S. Justice Department's National Institute of Justice. Today, that figure is somewhere between 245 and 328 million, though as Philip J. Cook and Kristin A. Goss in their thorough 2014 book The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know (Oxford University Press) wisely concluded, ""the bottom line is that no one knows how many firearms are in private hands in the United States."" Still, we have reason to believe gun prevalence likely surpassed the one-gun-per-adult mark early in President Barack Obama's first term, according to a 2012 Congressional Research Service report that relied on sales and import data. Yet during that same period, per-capita gun murders have been cut almost in half. One could argue that the relevant number is not the number of guns, but the number of people with access to guns. That figure is also ambiguous. A Gallup poll in 2014 found 42 percent of households claiming to own a gun, which Gallup reports is ""similar to the average reported to Gallup over the past decade."" But those looking for a smaller number, to downplay the significance of guns in American life, can rely on the door-to-door General Social Survey, which reported in 2014 that only 31 percent of households have guns, down 11 percentage points from 1993's 42 percent. There is no singular theory to explain that discrepancy or to be sure which one is closer to correct—though some doubt, especially as gun ownership continues to be so politically contentious, that people always reliably report the weapons they own to a stranger literally at their door. The gun murder rate in 1993 was 7.0 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. (Those reports rely on death certificate reporting, and they tend to show higher numbers than the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program, though both trend the same.) In 2000 the gun murder rate per 100,000 was 3.8. By 2013, the rate was even lower, at 3.5, though there was a slight upswing in the mid-00s. This simple point—that America is awash with more guns than ever before, yet we are killing each other with guns at a far lower rate than when we had far fewer guns—undermines the narrative that there is a straightforward, causal relationship between increased gun prevalence and gun homicide. Even if you fall back on the conclusion that it's just a small number of owners stockpiling more and more guns, it's hard to escape noticing that even these hoarders seem to be harming fewer and fewer people with their weapons, casting doubt on the proposition that gun ownership is a political crisis demanding action. In the face of these trend lines—way more guns, way fewer gun murders—how can politicians such as Obama and Hillary Clinton so successfully capitalize on the panic that follows each high profile shooting? Partly because Americans haven't caught on to the crime drop. A 2013 Pew Research Poll found 56 percent of respondents thought that gun crime had gone up over the past 20 years, and only 12 percent were aware it had declined. Do Gun Laws Stop Gun Crimes? The same week Kristof's column came out, National Journal attracted major media attention with a showy piece of research and analysis headlined ""The States With The Most Gun Laws See The Fewest Gun-Related Deaths."" The subhead lamented: ""But there's still little appetite to talk about more restrictions."" Critics quickly noted that the Journal's Libby Isenstein had included suicides among ""gun-related deaths"" and suicide-irrelevant policies such as stand-your-ground laws among its tally of ""gun laws."" That meant that high-suicide, low-homicide states such as Wyoming, Alaska, and Idaho were taken to task for their liberal carry-permit policies. Worse, several of the states with what the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence considers terribly lax gun laws were dropped from Isenstein's data set because their murder rates were too low! Another of National Journal's mistakes is a common one in gun science: The paper didn't look at gun statistics in the context of overall violent crime, a much more relevant measure to the policy debate. After all, if less gun crime doesn't mean less crime overall—if criminals simply substitute other weapons or means when guns are less available—the benefit of the relevant gun laws is thrown into doubt. When Thomas Firey of the Cato Institute ran regressions of Isenstein's study with slightly different specifications and considering all violent crime, each of her effects either disappeared or reversed. Another recent well-publicized study trying to assert a positive connection between gun laws and public safety was a 2013 JAMA Internal Medicine article by the Harvard pediatrics professor Eric W. Fleegler and his colleagues, called ""Firearm Legislation and Firearm-Related Fatalities in the United States."" It offered a mostly static comparison of the toughness of state gun laws (as rated by the gun control lobbyists at the Brady Center) with gun deaths from 2007 to 2010. ""States with strictest firearm laws have lowest rates of gun deaths,"" a Boston Globe headline then announced. But once again, if you take the simple, obvious step of separating out suicides from murders, the correlations that buttress the supposed causations disappear. As John Hinderaker headlined his reaction at the Power Line blog, ""New Study Finds Firearm Laws Do Nothing to Prevent Homicides."" Among other anomalies in Fleegler's research, Hinderaker pointed out that it didn't include Washington, D.C., with its strict gun laws and frequent homicides. If just one weak-gun-law state, Louisiana, were taken out of the equation, ""the remaining nine lowest-regulation states have an average gun homicide rate of 2.8 per 100,000, which is 12.5% less than the average of the ten states with the strictest gun control laws,"" he found. Public health researcher Garen Wintemute, who advocates stronger gun laws, assessed the spate of gun-law studies during an October interview with Slate and found it wanting: ""There have been studies that have essentially toted up the number of laws various states have on the books and examined the association between the number of laws and rates of firearm death,"" said Wintemute, who is a medical doctor and researcher at the University of California, Davis. ""That's really bad science, and it shouldn't inform policymaking."" Wintemute thinks the factor such studies don't adequately consider is the number of people in a state who have guns to begin with, which is generally not known or even well-estimated on levels smaller than national, though researchers have used proxies from subscribers to certain gun-related magazines and percentages of suicides committed with guns to make educated guesses. ""Perhaps these laws decrease mortality by decreasing firearm ownership, in which case firearm ownership mediates the association,"" Wintemute wrote in a 2013 JAMA Internal Medicine paper. ""But perhaps, and more plausibly, these laws are more readily enacted in states where the prevalence of firearm ownership is low—there will be less opposition to them—and firearm ownership confounds the association."" What About Suicides? Removing suicides from ""gun deaths"" is a basic step for assessing whether a gun regulation is producing its proposed effect, which in most cases is to reduce the number and severity of gun murders. But what do gun suicide rates tell us on their own? Chiefly, that a gun is a very efficient means of killing yourself. According to the CDC's National Vital Statistics System, 21,175 Americans committed suicide with firearms in 2013, more than twice as many as used the next most popular suicide method, suffocation. There were nearly twice as many gun suicides that year as gun homicides. Gun owners are more than three times as likely to commit suicide as non-gun owners, according to a 2014 Annals of Internal Medicine meta-analysis by Andrew Anglemyer and his colleagues. They looked at 14 previous observational studies regarding suicide from 1988 to 2005, statistically re-analyzing them all together. They found that the studies (with one exception) indicated that the people who committed suicide (whether with a gun or not) were more likely, usually far more likely, to own guns than the control group of people with similar characteristics who did not kill themselves. This does not, however, allow us to conclude that the gun's presence caused the suicide, since it's always possible that those more likely to be suicidal are more likely to want to own guns. A 2002 study by Mark Duggan, now an economist at Stanford University, seems to endorse that conclusion, writing that ""much of the positive relationship between firearms ownership and suicide is driven by selection—individuals with above average suicidal tendencies are more likely to own a gun and to live in areas with relatively many gun owners."" The U.S. currently ranks 47th in total suicide rates among nations according to World Health Organization (WHO) calculations, and 11th among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nations. But our firearm suicide rates are among the highest in the world, likely behind only Uruguay. Nations with far tougher gun laws and far lower known prevalences of gun ownership, such as Japan, India, and Korea, have far higher overall suicide rates. This suggests that the percentage of firearms in America leads us to have more firearm suicides, but not necessarily more suicides overall. Of the 56 nations for which the WHO felt it had accurate reported method data, hanging remained the most popular means of death, accounting for over 40 percent of suicides in 35 of them. At least one study—""Small Arms Mortality: Access to Firearms and Lethal Violence,"" by Mark Konty and Brian Schaefer, published in 2012 in the journal Sociological Spectrum—used ""nation-level…data from the Small Arms Survey and the World Health Organization's measures of mortality"" to ""examine whether rates of small arm ownership have a positive effect on rates of homicide and suicide."" Their conclusion: ""Contrary to the opportunity model, the accessibility of firearms does not produce more homicide or suicide when other known factors are controlled for."" Still, evidence from the Anglemyer meta-analysis suggests that policies like waiting periods, trigger locks, or other ""safe storage"" requirements might prevent some suicides by inserting at least a little extra time to think things through. Is Having a Gun in the Home Inherently Deadly? The idea that keeping a gun in the home puts owners and their families at elevated risk first rose to prominence in a 1993 New England Journal of Medicine article by Arthur Kellermann and his colleagues. ""Although firearms are often kept in homes for personal protection,"" they concluded, ""this study shows that the practice is counterproductive."" The study has many flaws. In addition to the predictable failure to establish causality, there's a more glaring irregularity: Slightly less than half of the murders Kellermann studied were actually committed with a gun (substantially less than the national average in 1993 of around 71 percent). And even in those cases he failed to establish that the gun owners were killed with their own guns. If even a small percentage of them weren't, given that more than half of the murders were not committed with guns, the causal relevance of the harmed being gun owners is far less clear. (The study found that even more dangerous risks than having a gun at home included living alone, using drugs, or being a renter.) A 2013 literature review in the journal Aggression and Violent Behavior, written by the University of Utrecht psychologist Wolfgang Stroebe, starts with Kellermann but rejects the idea that firearm possession is ""a primary cause of either suicide or homicide."" However, he writes, ""since guns are more effective means for [actually killing someone] than poison or other weapons, the rate of firearm possession can be expected to be positively related to overall rates of suicide and homicide."" But even then we can't be sure of causality, since guns might be the choice of people with more serious lethal intent, against themselves or others, to begin with. Stroebe notes that the two major post-Kellermann studies most often used to demonstrate an association between gun ownership and risk of homicide shared one of Kellermann's fatal flaws: They offer no information about whether the gun used to kill the gun owners was their own. And despite Kellermann's finding that living alone was very risky, one of the follow-ups, a 2004 study by Linda Dahlberg and colleagues, found that it was only those with roommates who faced a higher risk of a specifically gun-related homicide. Are Guns a Public Health Hazard? Public health—long associated with the prevention of communicable diseases—got into the gun social science game with a vengeance in the 1990s. These scholars commonly viewed weapons as nothing more than vectors for harm; leading lights, such as a professor at Harvard's School of Public Health, could happily declare: ""I hate guns and cannot imagine why anybody would want to own one. If I had my way, guns for sport would be registered, and all other guns would be banned."" The CDC earlier in 1987 published a study openly recommending confiscating guns in the name of public health. Public health scholars have continued to research from a place of hostility to firearms. An October 2015 special issue of the journal Preventive Medicine dedicated to guns began with an editorial that praised the role the public health movement played in spreading vaccines and reducing tobacco use, then cut to the quick: ""It is the editorial position of this journal that there is one overtly visible and low-hanging fruit left in the tree, one that has surprisingly eluded concerted action from public health: gun violence prevention."" Alas, there is an obstacle: the ""peculiar proclivity that much of the American population has with firearms."" That proclivity is indeed vast. In addition to those owning guns for reasons of self-defense, there is the massive recreational component. A 2011 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service survey found that ""13.7 million people, 6% of the U.S. population 16 years old and older, went hunting."" The National Sporting Goods Association says there were at least 20 million recreational target shooters in the U.S. as of 2014. Less quantifiable, but still quite real, are the sense of self-fulfillment and identity that guns and gun culture bring to Americans, the same way any other recreation from surfing to sailing to car culture does. Attempts to scientifically demonstrate the ""social costs"" of guns—for example, a 2006 Journal of Public Economics paper called ""The Social Costs of Gun Ownership,"" by Duke's Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig (then of Georgetown)—typically don't rigorously address these benefits. While most of the articles in the Preventive Medicine issue were standard anti-gun material, one piece perhaps inadvertently undermined a popular argument for expanding background checks. ""Sources of Guns to Dangerous People: What We Learn By Asking Them,"" by Philip Cook and colleagues, surveyed a set of jailed criminals in Cook County, Illinois. It found that they ""obtain most of their guns from their social network of personal connections. Rarely is the proximate source either direct purchase from a gun store, or theft."" So the go-to remedy for gun control advocates seeking to limit homicides might not have much impact on actual gun criminals. How Often Are Guns Used Defensively? One of the most powerful narratives gun advocates have on their side is the image of a woman pulling a handgun out of her clutch to prevent a rape, or a man cocking a shotgun at a burglar to defend his family. Many social scientists who research this issue of ""defensive gun use"" (DGUs) say such scenarios are vanishingly rare, arguing that owning a gun is more likely to lead to harm for the owner than be his or her savior in a pinch. There are no even halfway thorough documentations of every such event in America. They are not all going to end up reported in the media or to the police. The FBI and the CDC will have no reason to record or learn about the vast majority of times a crime was prevented by the potential victim being armed. So our best estimates come from surveys. The survey work most famous for establishing a large number of DGUs—as many as 2.5 million a year—was conducted in 1993 by the Florida State University criminologists Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. Kleck says they found 222 bonafide DGUs directly via a randomized anonymous nationwide telephone survey of around 5,000 people. The defender had to ""state a specific crime they thought was being committed"" and to have actually made use of the weapon, even if just threateningly or by ""verbally referring to the gun."" Kleck insists the surveyors were scrupulous about eliminating any responses that seemed sketchy or questionable or didn't hold up under scrutiny. Extrapolating from their results, Kleck and Gertz concluded that 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs happened in the U.S. each year. In a 2001 edition of his book Armed, Kleck wrote that ""there are now at least nineteen professional surveys, seventeen of them national in scope, that indicate huge numbers of defensive gun uses in the U.S."" The one that most closely matched Kleck's methods, though the sample size was only half and the surveyors were not experienced with crime surveys, was 1994's National Survey of the Private Ownership of Firearms. It was sponsored by the U.S. Justice Department and found even more, when explicitly limiting them to ones that met the same criteria as Kleck's study—4.7 million (though the research write-up contains some details that may make you wonder about the accuracy of the reports, including one woman who reported 52 separate DGUs in a year). The major outlier in the other direction, nearly always relied on for those downplaying the defensive benefits of guns, is the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), a nationally representative telephone survey, which tends to find less than 70,000 DGUs per year. In the October 2015 special issue on ""gun violence prevention,"" Preventive Medicine featured the latest and most thorough attempt to treat the NCVS as the gold standard for measuring defensive gun usage. The study, by Harvard's Hemenway and Sara J. Solnick of the University of Vermont, broke down the characteristics of the small number of DGUs recorded by the NCVS from 2007 to 2011. The authors found, among other things, that ""Of the 127 incidents in which victims used a gun in self-defense, they were injured after they used a gun in 4.1% of the incidents. Running away and calling the police were associated with a reduced likelihood of injury after taking action; self-defense gun use was not."" That sounds not so great, but Hemenway went on to explain that ""attacking or threatening the perpetrator with a gun had no significant effect on the likelihood of the victim being injured after taking self-protective action,"" since slightly more people who tried non-firearm means of defending themselves were injured. Thus, for those who place value on self-defense and resistance over running, the use of a weapon doesn't seem too bad comparatively; Hemenway found that 55.9 percent of victims who took any kind of protective action lost property, but only 38.5 percent of people who used a gun in self-defense did. Kleck thinks the National Crime Victimization Survey disagrees so much with his own survey because NCVS researchers aren't looking for DGUs, or even asking about them in so many words. The survey merely asks those who said ""yes"" to having been a crime victim whether they ""did or tried to do"" something about it. (You might not consider yourself a ""victim"" of a crime you have successfully prevented.) Kleck surmises that people might be reluctant to admit to possibly criminal action on their own part (especially since the vast majority of crime victimizations occurred outside the home, where the legality of gun possession might be questionable) to a government surveyor after they've given their name and address. And as he argued in a Politico article in February 2015, experienced surveyors in criminology are sure that ""survey respondents underreport (1) crime victimization experiences, (2) gun ownership and (3) their own illegal behavior."" The social science quest for the One True DGU Number is interesting but ultimately irrelevant to those living out those specific stories, who would doubtless be perplexed to hear they shouldn't have the capacity to defend themselves with a gun because an insufficiently impressive number of other citizens had done the same. Even if the facts gleaned from gun social science were unfailingly accurate, that wouldn't make such policy decisions purely scientific. Could More Guns Mean Less Crime? The most well-known proponent of the idea that widespread private gun ownership might reduce the rates of violent crime is John Lott, a law and economics professor who has held positions at Yale, UCLA, and the University of Chicago, and who now works as an independent scholar with an organization he runs called the Crime Prevention Research Center. In 1998 Lott published the controversial book More Guns, Less Crime (University of Chicago Press), which was updated with a third edition in 2010. Lott's main argument is that pro-gun policies, such as shall-issue right-to-carry (RTC) laws, tend to lower most crime rates against person and property. Violent crime has been going down in America in the era when right to carry has spread, but social science is more complicated than simply pointing to two quantities moving in opposite directions. The most obvious and important fact in modern criminology—the huge decline in crime rates that started a quarter century ago—still lacks anything approaching a universally agreed-upon set of explanations. That fact should help contextualize the picayune and arcane level of argumentation over variables accounted for, specific data sets consulted, and number of different specifications tested when scholars try to buttress or refute Lott's thesis. The range of contentious issues involved in Lott's techniques were summed up pretty thoroughly in a sympathetic but critical review of the third** edition in Regulation. The economist Stan Liebowitz of the University of Texas at Dallas wrote: ""Should county level data or state level data be used? Should all counties (or states) be given equal weight? What control variables should be included in the regression? What violent crime categories should be used? How should counties that have zero crimes in a category, such as murder, be treated? How much time after passage of a law is enough to determine the effect of RTC laws? What is the appropriate time period for the analysis?"" Lott tried to demonstrate that on the county level, violent crime trends showed signs of improvement in counties that had or passed RTC laws compared to counties that had not, among other things checking both mean crime rates and the slope of crime rates before and after RTC passage. He attempted to control for many handfuls of other variables that might affect crime rates—indeed, some researchers accused him of accounting for too many variables, while others slammed him for failing to account for other factors, like conviction rates or length of prison sentences. Trying to prove Lott wrong quickly became a cottage industry for others interested in the nexus of guns and public safety. The back-and-forths were so extensive that the latest edition of Lott's book is nearly twice as long, with his reactions to his critics. The U.S. National Research Council (NRC), inspired in part by the Lott debate, assessed the state of the gun controversy in 2004's Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review. The council concluded Lott had not fully proved that RTC laws lowered crime significantly; it also denied that the laws had provably increased crime. ""Answers to some of the most pressing questions cannot be addressed with existing data and research methods,"" study authors Charles F. Wellford, John V. Pepper, and Carol V. Petrie wrote, ""because of the limitations of existing data and methods, [existing findings] do not credibly demonstrate a causal relationship between the ownership of firearms and the causes or prevention of criminal violence."" That statement is perhaps the most important for people trying to use social science to make gun policy to remember, and there is no strong reason to believe the past decade of research has made it obsolete. Lott has maintained for years that, even if his critics were right about his positive effects not being robust enough, if you are contemplating for public policy considerations whether expanded RTC is a good, bad, or neutral idea, no one had yet demonstrated that RTC laws made any relevant crime or safety outcome worse. Then, in 2011, Abhay Aneja, John Donohue, and Alexandria Zhang came out with ""The Impact of Right-to-Carry Laws and the NRC Report: Lessons for the Empirical Evaluation of Law and Policy,"" a paper in the American Law and Economics Review. Working at a very high level of statistical sophistication and running their data through a huge variety of different specifications and assumptions, the authors concluded that ""aggravated assault rises when RTC laws are adopted. For every other crime category, there is little or no indication of any consistent RTC impact on crime."" (While this kind of social science is always working with subtle attempts to figure out how much more certain quantities might have changed had things been different, it's worth noting that while the number of states with ""shall issue"" or unrestricted carry permit laws has more than doubled since 1991, aggravated assault rates overall have fallen by 44 percent since 1995.) The study is suffused with an advanced sense of caution. As the authors write in a 2014 update of that study, ""we show how fragile panel data evidence can be, and how a number of issues must be carefully considered when relying on these methods to study politically and socially explosive topics with direct policy implications."" They stress ""the difficulties in ascertaining the causal effects of legal interventions, and the dangers that exist when policy-makers can simply pick their preferred study from among a wide array of conflicting estimates."" And ""a wide array of conflicting estimates"" is definitely what confronts anyone wading into the social science related to guns and gun laws. Researchers can and should try to go beyond mere binaries about laws existing or not existing when making subtle assessments of causation. Lott, for example, gets as granular as he can when studying RTC laws, considering not just whether they exist or not, but how easy it is to actually obtain a permit where it's legal to do so. If it's more expensive and time-consuming to get one even in a ""shall issue"" state, that will likely blunt the law's causal effects at least somewhat. Along the way, Lott has tried to compile the number of permit holders nationally. He figures the total is 12.8 million, up from 4.6 million as recently as 2007. And now six** states allow so-called ""constitutional carry"" without a permit, creating a pretty much uncountable body of potential RTC practitioners. We still don't know how many people with gun permits actually carry their weapons, and we have no idea about the end of the causal chain of speculations about how such laws affect crime: what potential criminals believe about how many citizens are carrying guns. Do 'Common-Sense Gun Laws' Work? At the top of the list of ""common-sense gun safety laws"" is expanding background checks beyond the current requirements for federally licensed dealers. The underlying belief here is that the various classes of federally prohibited gun owners, such as felons or those adjudicated mentally ill or known to be drug addicts, should never be able to use ""loopholes"" such as buying from a private citizen to get a gun (even though the vast majority of all those categories of people would never misuse a weapon). An April 2015 study by Daniel Webster and three colleagues for the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research earned positive press for claiming that the tougher laws Connecticut passed in 1995 (requiring a background check and a permit for any gun purchase from any source) lowered the state's gun murder rate by 40 percent. Since Connecticut and most of the rest of the country were all enjoying huge murder reductions in the years after that law went into effect, the researchers couldn't meaningfully compare what happened in Connecticut with what happened in the rest of the country. They needed to compare Connecticut's post-law results to what they think would have happened with gun murders in the state had the law not passed. So they created a statistical model of a ""synthetic Connecticut"" that was 72 percent comprised of Rhode Island, based in essence on the principle that past results would guarantee future performance, since in the past Rhode Island's murder rates and changes tended to match Connecticut's. Then they compared the two states from 1996-2005. The results? ""Connecticut Handgun Licensing Law Associated With 40 Percent Drop in Gun Homicides"" blared the Johns Hopkins press release headline. Rhode Island's murder rate went up unusually after 1997 (the researchers don't speculate on why that might have been), thus creating some ""extra"" murders (presuming that choices to murder in Rhode Island would have for some reason created a proportional number of choices to murder in Connecticut) that we can credit Connecticut with having evaded thanks to the more stringent gun law. But what happens when you extend the analytic period beyond the arbitrary cutoff date of 2005? From 2005 to 2012, Connecticut's gun murders per 100,000 people increased 66 percent, from 2.05 to 3.41, while Rhode Island's went down 20 percent, from 1.83 to 1.45. It seems quite premature to take Webster and his team's counterfactual guess about expected murder rates over one 10-year period as establishing any reliable causal knowledge about the effects of tougher gun purchasing laws. Yet that study was used to help buttress a proposed federal law the week it went public, trying to pressure other states into following Connecticut's lead on background checks and permits, given what we now ""know"" about how life-saving that move had been. Webster and his colleagues produced a similar but more rigorous study in 2014. It involved actual counts and not assumptions about what might have happened in a counterfactual, and it didn't stop looking at forward data at the most convenient time for its conclusions. This study tried to prove that Missouri's 2007 repeal of its ""permit to purchase"" law led to a 16 percent increase in murder rates there. Lots of other factors were controlled for, and the numbers indeed showed higher murder rates compared to the U.S. average at the time after the permit law was repealed. It's tricky to credit the permit-to-purchase repeal with causing that rise, because in the four years prior to eliminating the law, Missouri's murder rates had already gone up 15 percent while the national one had stayed essentially the same. This suggests that unaccounted factors influenced Missouri's rising murder rate both before and after the law changed. Even if both studies had been flawless, seeing one thing happening in one place over a limited time is usually not sufficient to establish a scientifically valid causal relationship that policy makers can confidently expect to see replicated elsewhere. Aaron Brown, the chief risk manager at AQR Capital Management and a statistician with interest in gun issues, has lamented that the overarching problem with most of these attempts to learn what effect any element of gun prevalence or gun laws has on any real-world outcome is that there simply aren't enough varied data to be sure of anything. There's another very likely step between ""law exists"" and ""law changes behavior"" that most gun social science doesn't, and likely really can't, account for. After Webster's Connecticut study appeared, I asked him: Since you are presuming a strong causal effect from the law's existence, how did you account for how stringently or effectively the law is enforced? If people continued to blithely sell weapons without background checks or permits, that would blunt the notion the law would have such a strong effect on gun murder rates. Webster's emailed reply: ""Virtually no studies of gun control law take enforcement into account because data are lacking and we don't really know the degree to which deterrence (people not wanting to violate the law) is a function of levels of enforcement."" Unknowables shadow the causal chain in nearly all social science involving any law's effects on behavior. Elusive Knowledge The Duke economist Philip J. Cook put the knowledge problem well in a 2006 Journal of Policy Analysis and Management article. ""Policy analysts are trained to critique evaluation evidence, pointing out potential flaws,"" Cook and co-author Jens Ludwig wrote, ""but are perhaps not so well prepared to judge whether the preponderance of the evidence points in one direction or another."" In other words, the most convincing element of any gun study tends to be the part where one scientist is explaining why another one's causal conclusions don't hold up. The parts where they claim strong or definite policy-relevant causal knowledge tend to be much more questionable. Cook and Ludwig, in their aforementioned 2006 paper ""The Social Costs of Gun Ownership,"" look at this loose link between scientific knowledge and policy differently. They grant that perhaps we're asking more of science than it can give to the policy debate. But that shouldn't stop us from using it to promote more gun law interventions, they maintain. ""Suppose [a certain intervention] implies the treatment reduces gun crime by 25% but the p-value on this point estimate is just .15, short of the conventional .05 cutoff,"" they wrote. ""Any academic referee worth her salt would reject a paper submitted for scientific publication that claimed this intervention 'worked.'"" But, Cook and Ludwig wonder, are those scientific standards too rigorous for statecraft? ""Would that referee really want to live in a jurisdiction where this evidence persuaded policymakers that they should not adopt the new treatment, but rather stick with the status quo?"" As Harvard's Hemenway explained to me, the confidence intervals of the social sciences in colloquial terms demand a belief that the chances are 19 to 1, or at worst 10 to 1, for you being right about your conclusion before you accept it as provisionally verified. Hemenway also believes, given the good he thinks can come from legal interventions about guns, that we don't need to be that certain we are right for policy work. But that's easier to accept if you don't value any particular benefits to relatively unrestricted private gun ownership—scientific, constitutional, or just personal. Some researchers, particularly in the public health field, act as if there were no values to balance on the other side of the policy goal of making it harder for people to get guns. Whether you consider the associations and causations supposedly demonstrated by gun-related social sciences to be proven beyond whatever level of doubt you see as appropriate, applying those stipulated facts to policy questions can never itself be a purely mathematical or scientific process. It's politics all the way down, and that politics is less informed by rigorous and certain knowledge than President Obama thinks. **Correction: The article originally and incorrectly stated that it was the first edition of Lott's book being reviewed, and that there were only four constitutional carry states.

There once was a girl from Brighton Whose boyfriend said “My, that’s a tight one” She said “You poor soul” “You’ve got the wrong hole” “But there’s plenty of room in the right one!” Rhymed a word with itself – no points. SHIT!!! I just made that point yesterday!! But – in my defense – I was rhyming “tight one” with “right one” …. not “one” and “one”. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it…. Ats a right proper rhyme, that is. You’re rhyming two syllables (i.e. Brighton) and you get FULL CREDIT. YAY ME!!! My last pay check was $9500 working 12 hours a week online.

Does this asshole even have the ability to make a statement without lying? THE SOCIAL SCIENCE IS SETTLED!!!! WHY DO YOU WANT CHILDREN TO DIE?!?!?! Because Planned Parenthood Profits depend on it? /not really my position. Still a good point, tho. As we know, immigration and abortion are the two areas where us *libertarian-like creatures* will never agree…. I think it might be easier to cover those topics where there is agreement. Judging by the ven-diagram of opinion sets on this commentariat (troll outliers removed) I think the only overlap can be summed up in the repeated refrain “fuck you, cut spending”. Ironic that two government employees agree on that… How can you be a libertarian while working for the government, or accepting any government benefits, such as roads, utilities, etc.? /troll outlier A: I’m not a libertarian. I’m a fiscal and social conservative. B: It’s a job. I provide a service, they pay me, just like any other employer. Also, there’s nothing that says an employee cannot be critical of the actions or policies of their employer, public or private. (unless you’re a spokesperson and you have a contract where your job is shilling said employer, etc. But I work in IT). C: If the roads, and utilities were not a government-backed monopoly, I’d have the ability to do business with someone else. As it stands we’re forbidden from having the choice. yes, I know your comment was snark, but I felt compelled to answer it. Hey, man. Whatever helps you sleep at night. You don’t even want to know what I do for the government….but I’m still a libertarian! You’re our NSA plant? And if I was would you hold it against me?!?! Well put, although I personally chose never to work as a gov’t employee after having worked for them before. The deciding moment was when my bureaucrat boss told me to go buy a $10,000 printer for $30,000 so that we could use up our budget and not lose it the next year. I wondered: if my department is doing this, how many other departments are doing this, and how much taxpayer money are they wasting overall? Can I be a part of this wholesale waste and look at myself in the mirror every morning? The answer for me is no. So is muck at the bottom of a lake, and dead fish, and the Titanic. Lies. Damned lies. And Statistics. He makes sure to cram all three into each and every statement he makes. “We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths.” We also know that large cities like Chicago where gun laws are the strongest have more gun deaths on any given weekend than rural areas have in a year. I live in a rural Louisiana parish. We had no gun deaths last year, or the year before. In fact our last shooting was in 2011 and no one was killed. How many shootings were there in Chicago last weekend? D.C.? New Orleans? You can count on gun grabbers to lie like you can count on the sunrise. Before guns were invented, there were zero gun deaths. However, there was far from a lack of violence or death of any kind. Before guns were invented, there were zero gun deaths. And lo, there was a great silence across the land as each progressive knelt and pondered a previously unconsidered truth. There was no income tax before there were guns. The income tax of 1848 in the Communist Manifesto requires men with guns to go out and collect the tax, as belabored by Lysander Spooner. Ergo, no guns, no income tax. Whose side are the sensitive, concerned and aware progressive socialists on, anyway? What if the tax collector had a pointed stick? Or at least some fresh fruit? Of course not. He can’t open his pie hole without telling a ie. Right from the start, even the word “We” is a lie! Good morning. Also, GREAT article by Doherty… No kidding…I laughed, I cried, I raged, and I rejoiced. “The Force Awakens and Gets a Cuppa” isn’t as good as this article. Article? There are articles on reason? They are the non-essential filler before the comments. Sort of like a salad before your steak and baked potato. Well, yeah. But nobody actually reads them. …Do they? You start, but then it gets boring, so once you have the gist: On to the comments! I read Shikha’s articles, but only if I need to induce vomiting. This might be the biggest Tony signal in recent memory. Hopefully he had to call in sick today. I thought the Tomy Signal was an image of an 11 year old boy with his pants pulled down bent over. The bottom line is that statists like Barack Obama don’t want Americans to do for themselves. The state knows better than you your wants and needs, and what is required of you to contribute to the health of the state. For you to be able to defend yourself against an aggressive fellow citizen means you could also defend yourself against state agents coming with your orders. The more we rely on the state for anything, the more power it has. Central planning requires powerful hand and fails when the chess pieces can resist their moves around the board. Armed chess pieces are especially troublesome. It’s easy to paint those who correctly make the 2nd Amendment about a check on government power as crazies, because most people are ignorant of the history of powerful governments or incorrectly believe that this powerful government will stop at their doorstep. So we will continue to get lies and obfuscations about guns because they know that the 2nd Amendment is the greatest barrier we have against successful central planning. It seems to me,with the antics of those in the Secret Service,maybe they need to be disarmed. Coke ,alcohol ,hookers and guns are not a good mix. Coke ,alcohol ,hookers and guns are not a good mix. But it does make for a helluva Saturday night. Coke ,alcohol ,hookers and guns are not a good mix. I don’t think you are a True Libertarian. Hey, he didn’t say one word about ass sex, weed, or Mexicans. But it would make for a great convenience store. This brings up a point I have been meaning to address, Fist. We all know the quote from Solzhenitsyn about ” “And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family?…” But – and this may be off topic – someone in the commentariat here brought up that it is this very same sentiment – a sentiment that we all approve of – that the cops use to justify murdering citizens with impunity because “they don’t have to risk their lives just to determine if it was a cell phone or a gun!” How do we still agree with Solzhenitsyn’s quote and still logically call for police reform? If our sentiments are in agreement with the quote, aren’t cops justified in being the pants-shitting pussies that murder children? I would say there is a qualitative difference between the kind of Gestapo/Statsi agent who rounds up adults for political crimes and simply out of control cops who escalate situations with under-age people who don’t have the understanding or self-control of a mature adult. The former are enforcing the rules of a police state where the “crimes” they enforce are understood by all even if they might not have true legitimacy. The latter just don’t seem to think they have to make room for people who might not expect – through lack of maturity, experience, or understanding – that they are about to be shot. They’re not justified in feeling that scared if they’re not actually threatened, and they’re not. Nikki, you’re gonna have a hard time convincing THEM of that when it has been an integral part of their rookie training for DECADES… No. If you’re scared of that, either don’t fuck up or don’t become a cop. How do we still agree with Solzhenitsyn’s quote and still logically call for police reform? Something like “Your cop tribe will continue to get gunned down by armed citizens unless and until they reform”? There aren’t enough SWAT teams, and never will be, to send a fully gunned-up squad every time a door needs kicking down. The critical piece that would accelerate this badly-needed rebalancing is laws and/or juries who recognize that citizens have a right to defend themselves against cops. The critical piece that would accelerate this badly-needed rebalancing is laws and/or juries who recognize that citizens have a right to defend themselves against cops. Or, perhaps just as good, juries who understand that citizens have a right to defend themselves from cops, regardless of any laws to the contrary, and recognize that they’re empowered to recognize this right, regardless of a judge’s instructions to the contrary. I think the essence of the reform at least I’m looking to see has to do with a change in the nature of the relationship between police and non-police, specifically the power dynamic. Currently, police are the authority, and non-police essentially have to hope that police behave in a fair, just manner. Ideally, and I think you get this in a situation where police don’t have a monopoly on force, police should behave as disinterested third-party mediators and as the defenders of last resort. Frankly, if someone is legally empowered to use deadly force against someone outside the scope of self-defense, that person’s power should absolutely be tempered by the cost of possibly being killed. If you’re willing to use lethal force to prevent someone from selling loose cigarettes, for example, the calculus of the decision changes once real personal risk enters the equation, and I believe that’s as it should be. You are undoubtedly the most ignorant fool that posts here. This is correct, not only because of the direct power of resistance afforded by being armed but also because someone who provides for his own self-defense tends to an annoying habit of taking care of himself in other ways. We are skeptical of state intervention in all areas of life. The progs find our lack of faith disturbing. i.e. Central planners know they cannot enact their preferred policies with an armed populace. That really says all we need to know about those policies. yup. the kinyun and his minions have a strong policy standard: thy government is thy god and thou shalt have no other gods before it. And individual subjects of that god must never be allowed the priviledge of making their own decisions, nor of taking responsibility for their own lives. They fail to comprehend that that much hated Second declares that “the security of a free state” rests on “the people”. Clearly NOT on government, as god or otherwise. Nor on military nor police nor…….. I’d really like to see a study that removed the top 10% of counties per population density and showed the homicide and violent crime rates of the remaining 90% compared to the counties removed. I’m willing to bet the homicide rate is at least 4x higher in the removed counties than in the remaining 90%. And I bet the laws in place in the states don’t cause much variance in crime rates when compared to population density. The actual correlation appears to be poverty and population density, not strict density. The more poor people piled on top of each other, the worse the crime gets (almost exponentially so). Looking at the rough statistics I noticed something interesting. There is a rapid drop-off in density within the top ten territories. (Several of these are subordinate components of other states, but the shape of that curve is impressive) Numbers are persons per square mile: 1 Macau (China) 54,970 2 Monaco 48,951 3 Singapore 19,935 4 Hong Kong (China) 17,019 5 Gibraltar (UK) 11,007 6 Vatican City 4,709 7 Bahrain 4,224 8 Malta 3,421 9 Bermuda (UK) 3,139 10 Bangladesh 2,871 As a comparison: 182 United States 85.02 One bone I have to pick with this – while, yes, the headcount per square mile for the US is 85.02 there are very few Americans who live in areas which are that unpopulated. It would make more sense to calculate the average local population density for each American. Look at it this way – if somehow Singapore gained ownership of Antarctica would the average Singaporean suddenly have more living space? Yes, I was going to add another point for NYC at 27,000 p/sqmi Which provides another interesting comparison because Signapore and Monaco have far less crime than NYC. Across the river in Union City, NJ the density is even greater (IIRC, 57,000 per square mile) and they have a slightly lower crime rate than NYC. Look at Chicago for conformation of your opinion. Not a good bet. I meant in the US. Singapore is an outlier I kept reading that as “Countries” not “Counties” Ugh. Silly me. I imagine that it tracks closer to counties with high participation in assistance programs. The rural counties in KY that are fueled by welfare are violent as all get out. Especially intrafamily murders. And don’t forget the hillbilly feuds! ‘Hunting accidents’ . ‘I thought it was the orange-vested deer, honest’ ‘He was coming right at me’!! ‘He was coming right at me’!! So… the hunters shot each other? Were the squirrels to blame? Damn tree rats. Hillbillies cause a lot fewer deaths then Inner city gangs. “I’m willing to bet the homicide rate is at least 4x higher…” 1000x would probably be a safe bet. I like to mention this when people compare Canada and the US in terms of homicides and gun laws. Canada has two areas with pop. densities greater than 250/sq.km., where the US has way more than that. I’d be more interested in separating out each gross data set into a county by county data set, analising each “population” separately, then comparing them by population density for the variables and controls. You bet, the murder rates in dense city areas WILL be higher than in rural counties. As well, the gun ownership/CCL ratios per person will radically change between dense urban settings and spare rural ones. I believe the total number of CCL’s in Los Angeles County California is well under a hundred (and it is certain most of those are to somebodies who are SOMEBODY (as in, more equal pigs) while at the same time, Tulare County, 150 miles to the north in sparse Central Valley farm country (or what WAS farms until the Three Inch Delta Smelt acceded to the throne in the temple and MUST be bowed down to and worshipped) has a population of about 100,000 but the sheriff in that county has issued more than FOUR THOUSAND permits. Now, compare violent crime rates, and even housebreakings: Tulare County is FAR safer to live in than Los Angeles County. MANY TIMES more guns, a fraction of violent crimes and housebreakings. Could there be a correlation between those stats? I rather think so…. Poor NYC. First they find out that deep dish is better, and now this: http://www.foxnews.com/leisure…..ntcmp=hpff Deep dish is better than what? Certainly not better than actual pizza. In a blind taste test, Deep Dish beat out Hard tack. How could it be blind? Completely different textures – one is a pizza, and one is some sort of bastard casserole. Deep dish tastes okay, but it is not pizza. A pizza/casserole hybrid? Real Italian pizza is deep dish. It’s known as pizza pie. I’m sorry, but I’m siding with the anti-scoopers. This is pretty much how I feel. “It was the moment I realized my ex was a monster,” Lisa Rosenberg, a 27-year-old graphic designer living in Bushwick, Brooklyn, says of a guy she dated for about a year. “Even watching someone eating [a scooped-out bagel] is completely repulsive.” bagel scoopers are lumped in with people who eat their pizza with a fork This makes me so fucking angry!!!! I eat my deep dish pizza with a fork! One: Deep Dish is not pizza, it’s casserole, and thus forking it is acceptable behaviour. Two: What the fuck is “Bagel Scooping”? They scoop out the insides of a split bagel with a spoon, leaving only the “skin.” That’s barbaric! Break their fingers until they learn to stop doing such awful things to food. Same here UnCivil. I read the article but it is just word salad to me. I don’t know what any of that means. *takes another bite of delicious toasted buttery English Muffin* Now I keep thinking of bagel sandwiches. (replace standard bread or roll with bagel of choice.) I vote either cheddar cheese or salt for a pastrami and swiss sandwich. If only I had time to swing by the store on my way home… Bialy: The delicious miscegenation of bagels and English Muffins. The funny thing is, the stores tag the bialy at a higher price to the bagels, but the cahsiers always ring them up as bagels, even when you state uneequivocally that they’re bialys. I had a surprisingly good bialy in Seattle. Big, with lots of onions and cheese. Were they trying to make a pizza and failed? Well, “lots” in comparison to the NYC version. It was the bread for a smoked salmon scramble and goat cheese sandwich. So good. Look. Guns are an efficient way to kill. There’s no denying that. So therefore that means that the mere presence of a gun increases the risk of death. How could it not? Prove that it doesn’t. And don’t go and cite “statistics” gathered by those stupid right-wingers. Their studies are tainted because of their politics. You can only cite studies by people who support gun control. There. You can’t do it. Ha ha. You’re wrong. Sadly, this is what actual proggies really believe. I would say that owning a car increases the risk of death too.Maybe at a higher rate Same goes for swimming pools. And ladders And living next to Warty. You violated the exclusion zone, we accept no liability for your actions. Two story homes? Or homes with lots of front steps? What about hammers, baseball bats and other blunt instruments? Owning a car increases the risk of death to everyone, being that it increases global climate change. Re: Sarcasmic, Guns are an efficient way to kill. Actually, the most efficient way to kill is with poison. A person has to become proficient in the use of a gun before he or she can use it with “efficiency” which would mean shooting A bullet (not two or several) in the head or directly to the heart. Gaining such proficiency takes a lot of practice. Instead, to poison a person does not require any special skills from the murderer. I have made this point to several Marxian posters in FB and they still think a gun is infallible and 100% deadly. They have this image of the pioneer women in old matinee movies who always felled an Indian by pointing the musket anywhere. I don’t know who made the claim that guns are the most efficient way to kill. So while your argument does have merit, you’re wasting it on a straw man. Why do you want to make the world unsafe for strawmen? *opens a case of 7.62 incendiary rounds* I kinda wish they’d have released a ‘making of’ or BTS video for this. Guns are an efficient way to kill. There’s no denying that. So therefore that means that the mere presence of a gun increases the risk of death. How could it not? Prove that it doesn’t. If the mere presence of a gun increases the risk of death, then the huge increase in private ownership of firearms over the last two decades, and particularly the greatly increased presence of guns carried in public, should have resulted in the blood-running-in-the-streets scenario predicted by the anti-gun folk. Instead, (using statistics gathered by the FBI, which is not made up of stupid right-wingers) deaths are dropping. While that doesn’t prove that the increase in gun ownership is causing the drop in deaths, it clearly shows that the increase in gun ownership isn’t causing deaths to increase. Because they aren’t. 🙂 “There’s scientific consensus on guns?and the NRA won’t like it.” You know, a while ago there was this place where there was scientific consensus on Jews, and look what happened! Aaaand….*ACT*! But don’t let anybody snooker you with that line about “guns are only for killing”. Wrong. A guillotine is only for killing – it has no other purpose (it can be purposed for other things but those are not the purpose of a guillotine). A firearm is a tool for managing a violent encounter. It carries the potential for pain, injury, and death and in that can be used to negotiate through and possibly avoid injury during a violent encounter but all that depends on the skill of the user. I own several firearms that were expressly designed for poking holes in small pieces of paper at a known distance. Are they still only for killing? Killing what? Paper? (Based on an actual conversation with a progtard colleague, by the way.) “I own several firearms” You’ve probably been duped. These are air guns unless I’m mistaken. Not firearms. The lack of fire is the give away. Nope. A Ruger Competition Target, while only a .22, is a firearm. So is a .22 caliber 1930s-vintage Colt Officer’s Target. “guns are only for killing”. Wrong.” Only a fool would use a gun for something other than killing or wounding. Those clowns in Oregon, for example, armed themselves to the teeth and didn’t use their guns for anything other than waving about trying to look tough. They never fired a shot and now they’re in prison. If you are not prepared to use a gun properly, you have no business carrying one. They are not fashion accessories. Original statement: “guns are only for killing” Response: “Only a fool would use a gun for something other than killing or wounding.” Yeah, so…. you said something about fools, do they, by any chance, strawman? Also, target shooting is an actual sport. “target shooting is an actual sport” They were brandishing their guns. Not shooting, not killing, not wounding, not sporting. If these clowns had no idea of using guns as god intended, they shouldn’t have had them in the first place. It’s mark trueman. He says stupid & nonsensical things for the express purpose of getting one or more people riled up to the point they respond. By keeping his pronouncements sufficiently cryptic and facilely changing his argument, sometimes by redefining words in hilariously wrong ways, he entertains himself for hours pissing people off. The sensible thing to do is to ignore him. He is utterly useless and worthless. There literally is no benefit to interacting with him at all. Great article, Mr. Dougherty. I do want to pick just one nit. I think you’re probably being a bit too generous in saying that the science isn’t clear. It sounds a lot more to me like the takeaway here is that the research is cooked. Agree, fantastic article. Some things defy scientific analysis, because there are too many variables and science is impossible unless you can eliminate, or minimize, the existence of variables. Human interactions are such a thing, thus the concept of “social science” is a canard. Wait, I thought the CDC was forbidden to study gun violence for the last 20+ years… where is all this data coming from? Good thing Obama is going to make a new law today saying the CDC can now study gun violence again. We’ll finally have some statistics to use in our policy-making. CDC? No. Obama’s asshole? probably. Where he pulls a lot of his other lies. Obama gets an E for effort for his well intentions as far as guns are concerned. However, nothing will be accomplished with this STUPID executive order. There’s no way to enforce person A selling or giving away a gun to person B. Besides, the retards and the criminals will not register. They will simply buy the guns from the street. Or in the case of Sandy Hook, the retard will simply take the guns from his mother. I Tell you, the only good thing that came out of the Sandy Hook Shooting is that the Retard Kid first killed the biggest retard of them all, his Mother. One less so-called responsible gun owner to deal with in America. None of the legislation ever proposed after a shooring would have prevented the shooting . They’re never even remotely connected. Which tells you that the legislation is never about prevention in the first place. Its juat part of they’re incremental eating away at the 2nd while atanding on dead bobies. That is the goal. Agreed. It’s just political grand standing. No law in America is effective in combating gun crime. Each an every law created in the gun control effort only stops (or slows down) people that want to own guns. The criminals and Retards have full access to guns in America since guns are so ubiquitous. “The criminals and Retards have full access to guns in America since guns are so ubiquitous.” I think you underestimate the resourcefulness of people. If criminals and retards have full access to guns, then surely the same goes for the rest of us. *YAWN* He gets an A for Asshole. The effort isn’t about preventing another mass shooting since no law would have prevented any mass shooting. “the retards and the criminals will not register” Register what? Do you know what you are talking about? People who intend to commit crimes with their guns will simply find illegal means of acquiring their guns. Your telling me that criminals commit crimes that they are not allowed to? I refuse to believe that. has anyone tried telling them not to be criminals? /progderp Expecting a gun law to keep guns out of the hands of criminals is like putting up a fence to keep out birds. One flaw with that analogy – you can design a fence that stops birds, though it resembles a cage more than a fence. I prefer my 12 gauge O\U. has anyone tried telling them not to be criminals? Teach Criminals Not to Crime! Like that? There should be a law against commiting crimes Another of National Journal’s mistakes is a common one in gun science: The paper didn’t look at gun statistics in the context of overall violent crime, a much more relevant measure to the policy debate. After all, if less gun crime doesn’t mean less crime overall?if criminals simply substitute other weapons or means when guns are less available?the benefit of the relevant gun laws is thrown into doubt. I know Doherty is just trying to be generous, but that’s not a “mistake.” It’s data pimping, which is the natural result of positivism & physics envy taking over the social sciences and most people’s reluctance/inability to tackle the intimidating combination of reams of statistics and men whose extraordinary confidence is matched only by their ignorance. When I have to debate GC advocates, the first point I usually make is that we’re not interested in gun violence, but all violence. I have yet to meet a single person who was prepared for that, which goes to show the depth of ignorance we’re dealing with here. It’s no wonder they have the confidence of a fundamentalist preacher–they’re completely ignorant of the most basic facts about the issue. Damned! You beaten me to the punch! We’re just shouting into an Austrian echo chamber anyway. Positivism will continue to march ahead until a generation of philosophers comes along that’s willing to kill it. Another of National Journal’s mistakes is a common one in gun science: The paper didn’t look at gun statistics in the context of overall violent crime, a much more relevant measure to the policy debate. You say this as if these were honest mistakes that crept in those studies rather than a purposeful skewing of the data to prop up a particular narrative, Brian. I don’t see much difference between these studies that ostensibly show a direct correlation between more gun ownership and violent crime and current “Climate” science, with its penchant for moving the goal posts as expediency dictates, the most recent and egregious case being the scandalous change (which they called it “adjustments”) in temperatures by the NOAA. TEH SYENSE IZ SETTELLED!!!11!1!!! HERTIK!!!1!!!!!!!! FILTHEE SYENSE DENYER!!11!!1111!!!!!!! /progtard According to the CDC’s National Vital Statistics System, 21,175 Americans committed suicide with firearms in 2013, more than twice as many as used the next most popular suicide method, suffocation. I wonder how many of those suffocations were from auto-erotic asphyxiation related accidents? Should those really be counted as suicides? This was an excellent article but who beyond Reasonoids are going to read it? Facts and statistics matter very little when there’s an endless supply of unethical social scientists who 1) arrive at a politically motivated conclusion, 2) design studies that are customized to support that conclusion, and 3) release those conclusions to a compliant and sympathetic (and in some cases ignorant and stupid) press with the collusion of a political class that don’t give a tinker’s damn about what the truth of the matter is.. Their MO is twisting facts to reach a foregone conclusion and good luck convincing the left their science isn’t really science (it isn’t), you right wing, knuckledragging, children hating, gun fetishists. No point attempting to reason with or negotiate with progtards anymore. As long as there are people willing to kill people, people will need the right to be armed. We have the 2nd Amendment not to protect against the fools we have voted for now, but in case we vote for Mussolini or Hitler like fools in the future. Most gun deaths are from: 2006 Total (30896) 55% Suicides (16992) 41% Homicides (12667) 2% Unintentional (accidents) (618) 1% Legal Intervention (309) 1% Other (309) 2010 Total (31,076) 62% Suicides (19392) 35 % Homicides (11,078) 2% Unintentional (accidents) (606) Better mental health is the best way to decrease suicides. Solutions to gun violence: 1. Remove public-sector gun free zones. 2. Enact better mental health laws and treatment. (Mandatory treatment for those adjudicated violent mentally ill.) 3. End the drug war and decriminalize drugs. Allow teachers to be armed if they wish. Require they are trained. We know what happened to unarmed Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks in Ottoman Empire/Turkey during WWI. We know what happened to the unarmed Jews in Europe during WWII. We know what happened to unarmed Cambodians in Cambodia during the 1970’s. We know what happened and is happening to unarmed Darfurians in Darfur. We know what happened to unarmed Tutsi in Rwanda. We know what is happening to the unarmed in Africa today. We know what is happening to the unarmed in the Middle East today. How is the liberal agenda of disarming America still a thing? Statistics: http://www.gunpolicy.org/firea…..ted-states How is the liberal agenda of disarming America still a thing? Because, despite their claims to the contrary, libs/progs would be happy to see some of those “happenings” directed at non-libs/progs. Just as long as those doing the “happening” are in service of the state. Don’t see too many libs/progs wanting the security details surrounding lob/prog politicians to be disarmed. So the porous border liberals, who are OK with whatever and whoever strolling into the US, are fighting vehemently for for stricter gun laws in America? Mmmkay. Gun ban advocates in this country routinely perform the scam of including gun suicides in “gun death”, more than 60% of the total. Suicides are a voluntary act committed by people with many deep problems, and they choose a gun or other means to end their difficult existence. But including them into “gun death” greatly inflates the statistic and it is regularly mindlessly regurgitated by our ignorant media. Consider the top four methods of suicide in the US: Someone who commits suicide by jumping off a bridge or structure is not a victim of Bridge Violence or Building Violence. Someone who commits suicide by Poisoning is not a victim of Drug Violence or Natural Gas Violence. Someone who commits suicide by hanging himself is not a victim of Rope Violence. Someone who commits suicide by using a gun is not a victim of Gun Violence. They also include homicides with murders. Many of those homicides belong to criminals who, in the process of committing a crime, wind up getting shot. You’ll forgive me if I don’t shed too many tears over an attempted rape that concludes with the would-be rapist’s death by gunshot. Colonel Jeff Cooper has some wisdom on the subject of violence: “One bleeding-heart type asked me in a recent interview if I did not agree that ‘violence begets violence.’ I told him that it is my earnest endeavor to see that it does. I would like very much to ensure ? and in some cases I have ? that any man who offers violence to his fellow citizen begets a whole lot more in return than he can enjoy.” According to that logic, Police officers carry guns and Nuns do not. Nuns are shot at a vastly lower rate than Police. Disarm the Police? Arm the nuns. Regarding reporting of defensive gun use, the article notes, “There are no even halfway thorough documentations of every such event in America. They are not all going to end up reported in the media or to the police.” Perhaps one of the main reasons DGUs are underreported to authorities is that making such a report carries risks of its own, such as what actually happened to a good friend of mine some years back in Eugene, Oregon. He heard someone on his back porch trying to jimmy open his sliding glass door, so he flicked on the living room lights and the would-be burglar found himself staring down the barrel of my friend’s Glock. The bad guy fled–most likely with a sizable load of excrement in his pants, and my friend dutifully called the cops to report the incident. They dispatched two officers to take his statement, at the conclusion of which one of them said–ever so politely–“We’re going to need to take your gun with us.” Fortunately my friend, who is the son of a police officer and has a lot of friends who are lawyers, knew his rights and told the cop to go boil his head. But had the cop not eventually backed down, this could have gone sideways in a hurry. And I’m willing to bet if there’s ever a similar incident, the last thing he’ll think of doing will be to call the cops. When the people you call for help end up trying to rob you themselves, is it any wonder we would all just prefer to provide our own security with our own privately held firearms? That’s horrible. And I’m willing to bet if there’s ever a similar incident, the last thing he’ll think of doing will be to call the cops. The police: encouraging self-reliance and RKBA advocacy one 911 call at a time. Indeed, that was a discouragement of making a DGU report. Which makes the survey-based minimal 55,000-80,000/yr estimate of such DGU incidents, not drawn from any official records, all the more MINIMAL. Asset-forfeiture has already turned government personnel into “looters-by-law” and the 2007 crash and depression was the practical application of The Money Speech straight out of Atlas Shrugged. In a recent George Will column he reported that in 2013 more property was taken by asset forfeiture than by thieves. We are now living in a kleptocracy (as if it wasn’t before.) Link please? Look, nobody’s gonna convince a progressive (indoctrinated by a life of bullshit) to stop pursuing a “gun-free world.” NADA. All this Obama crap is designed to move the ball incrementally towards their goal – the executive orders, the bullshit consensus, the media shit-eaters. This is political and the people who support liberty and citizen’s rights over government power are pissing in the wind to try to convince the progressive gunphobes otherwise. Instead of playing defense and digging in to slow the forward movement, we need to find leaders who will take the game to offense and start passing laws that eliminate ANY and all gun restrictions and laws that support the 2nd amendment. Stop accepting gunhating judges, stop funding departments that support infringement. The left will shit its collective self and things will change for the better. Imagine that all our liberties were supported by our representatives. Okay. I already vote libertarian, and I know that “the case for voting Libertarian” is that it gets moronic laws repealed. i commend Doherty on his civility and courtesy. Great article, thanks for putting it together Google pay 97$ per hour my last pay check was $8500 working 1o hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for months now and he works about 22 hours a week. I cant believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is wha- I do…… ?????? http://www.buzznews99.com That was a very well researched and written article. Thanks for your efforts. In an issue so fraught with emotion, articles like this aren’t especially common, and this level of detail is even more rare. Thanks again. I don’t see why we can’t find a compromise on these issues. Communists and Dems don’t like the Second Amendment, fine. But cars, according to The Atlantic, still kill more people than guns–and there is no constitutional amendment protecting auto ownership. Recently in Austin TX a berserker named Rashad recently committed plural murder driving a car into a crowd. So where are the handwringing cries of Ban! Ban! and Terrorism? Banning automobiles would show voters Congress is serious and not hypocritical, and would pave the way for disarming enforcement personnel and enacting Barry Commoner gun laws. Libertarians don’t like the individual income tax, and point to roads that existed before its 1914 enactment. With no cars, communists would not need the income tax for the roads they refuse to believe already existed. So a ban on deadly automobiles would also… er… pave the way for repealing the other force amendment, as destructive of individual rights as the prohibition amendment turned out to be. Is that meant to be some form of satire? Hank, your comment, let’s say is just stupid. You might want to mention that Lott is infamous for not being able to produce the data from the surveys he based his 1997 paper on. That’s a huge red flag and when you cite him to people in the know, you lose credibility. He’s in the same category as Michael LaCour, so I think you should at least mention that and explain why you think his current research is meaningful. That being said, there is plenty of social science that comes to the same conclusion Lott does. It’s just that referencing him will give people on the anti gun side an easy target to attack. Also, mentioning that prisoners in from Cook County, IL got guns through social connections triggers alarm bells. That’s Chicago, with very strict gun laws. So it’s evidence that criminals will get guns even if there are strict laws (as long as it’s easy to move guns from places with permissive laws to places with strict laws,) it’s not a great indication that criminals in general get guns through social ties. Prisoners in, say, Texas, would be a better source of evidence for that. As it stands, this just adds fuel to the fire that we should have strict national laws because local laws can’t control what people do outside their jurisdiction. Other than that, I really enjoyed the article. You might want to mention that Lott is infamous for not being able to produce the data from the surveys he based his 1997 paper on. I believe only the data from one survey was lost in a (verified as fact) hard drive crash, and the survey was largely redone from scratch, producing very similar outcomes to the original surveys. No one so far has pointed out that the anti-gun “studies” all seem to come from Harvard. You’d think that, were there really consensus on the subject, SOME might come from the University of Nebraska or Colorado State, &c. There can be no correlation between gun ownership, gun regulation, and crimes with guns. As one poster pointed out, there are more shootings in Chicago in a week than there have been in his corner of Louisiana in 5 years. That is not because of gun control or the failure of gun control; it is because of Chicago, where even police routinely shoot African Americans in the street. If the polity is of a mind to tolerate using guns for violent crime, it should come as no sociological revelation that gun crime will increase. Furthermore, even if all these self-appointed Harvard experts were right, their findings are irrelevant. Guns won their place in the Constitution not so we could kill the hedgehogs and certainly not so we could kill each other. Guns won their place in the Constitution to ensure the balance of power by which we ultimately secure liberty. Indeed, we accept democracy as the primary means of settling political disputes precisely because it’s more sensible to throw balls of paper at opponents than balls of steel. There’s no reason for a minority to pay any attention to a democratic result if the winners aren’t prepared to back up their con with a sufficiency of force. But, where in these Harvard “studies” has anyone measured that? For the sake of argument let us assume that more guns mean more crime, murder, suicide, accidental shootings and cause diabetes. The whole idea of protecting the God Given Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms is to protect us from a tyrannical government; not so I can hunt, put holes in paper or even keep the local outlaw from mugging me. I am quite willing to put up with a larger amount of gun deaths so that I and my fellow citizens can protect ourselves from our government. In the same way I am willing to put up with a certain amount of car related deaths so that I and my fellow citizens can travel where we want efficiently. The correct reply to this and all “studies” that “prove” that guns are bad for me and the children is “Fuck Off Slaver”! Also, “cold dead fingers” should have gone somewhere in there. “Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.” –Ben Franklin Thus, some soccer mom claiming a “right” to feel safe does not trump our right to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government. The evils of a tyrannical government are far worse than the sneak thief in the night or the worry of a foreign invader. A tyrannical government combines the worst of both. I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty, than those attending too small a degree of it. — Thomas Jefferson “There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America,” President Barack Obama proclaimed after the October mass shooting that killed 10 at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Where do I get mine? At your local gun dealer. But hurry – – – – – – Why even bother using stats? They’re irrelevant even if true. The 2nd Amendment was, at least in part, an effort to keep the government in check by having an armed citizenry. “The 2nd Amendment was, at least in part, an effort to keep the government in check by having an armed citizenry.” As long as this armed citizenry of yours is more content to live on their knees than to die on their feet, all the 2nd Amendments in the world aren’t going to keep a government in check. In the nearly 240 years of this Republic we have transitioned from the frontiersman to the suburbanite lifestyle. The self-reliant, utterly free frontiersman is gone, replaced by others who have an interdependence on each other for their existence. If a president gave Obama’s speech in, say 1816, there would have been a mob of angry individualists with torches and rifles banging on the White House doors demanding his hide. We’re more likely today to “play by the rules” of legal actions and protests instead of direct action. This was even the case in 1775. The colonists suffered many years under the Crown before declaring independence. “Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.” We simply have not reached the point of contempt for the government that existed in 1775. Very nice review, thanks. However, I was surprised to see it twice mentioned that failure to determine if an owner’s gun were used against them was a flaw in associating a gun in the home with outcome of a criminal event. While an interesting aspect in its own right, it’s plainly not a necessary condition to claiming that association. An assailant doesn’t have to possess your gun for it, or even the presumption of it, to alter their behavior. Both sides readily make that claim. It’s more relevant to know whether the gun actually factored in – to what extent was it brought to bear, rather than simple being a demographic factor? I think I know what you’re trying to say. However, given the thrust of the Kellerman study which claimed that having a gun increased your risk of death, establishing whether the gun was involved in the death IS necessary. If a study claimed that owning a box of Corn Flakes increased your risk of death, a necessary part of that study would be to establish a relationship between the cereal and the death. That a homicide victim merely owned a gun has no more significance with regard to his/her risk of death than the fact that they had a box of Corn Flakes or they were a black belt in Karate. I think we’re saying the same thing. You might not die from eating the Corn Flakes, your sister might kill you for emptying the box. “…whether the gun was involved in death…” plainly encompasses more than having the gun turned on you. Not that I in the least disfavor wide latitude in self defense including ready access to a gun, just pointing out a twice-made statement that exhibited poor logic. Guns used for suicide is nobody else’s business. Guns used for mass shootings are an outlier. Guns used in homicides outside of “mass shootings” are largely part of the de facto wars fought by the black (no pun intended because Whites and Hispanics are a part of the subset) marketeers. We have large scale wars fought by the “legitimate” institutions (the laundered mafia known as governments) and we have small scale wars being fought by the shadow markets of organized crime. Nothing the Feds do will impact the availability of ordnance for those fighting their turf wars in our inner cities, leaking out into some suburbs. What remains of white gangs tend to move their venues for battle around while the blacks and hispanics fight over city blocks, sometimes house by house. Idiotic, blanket rules sticking red tape to the 99.99% who aren’t a problem does no good. I firmly believe the likes of Obama knows this, but the “laundered mafia” has every interest in disarming the 99.99% as best they can for their own interests. The intent of gun laws isn’t to lessen crime or even lessen the # of guns. It’s for some people to pat themselves on the back that they forced someone else to comply with something against their will. It’s really just a purely human motivation about the abuse of petty power. One HUGE problem comparing violent gun usage rates between states and cities is that researchers simply refuse to consider what is likely the SINGLE most important factor — race. See? Me even SAYING “race” makes you cringe. But consider: Blacks constitute about 13.2% of America’s population. http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html Yet when it comes to crime, the FBI reports that in 2012 blacks committed: 49.4% of all murders 32.5% of all forcible rapes 54.9% of all robberies 34.1% of all aggravated assaults 28.1% of ALL crime http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cj…..verviewpdf Where are the studies relating murder rates to signs of the Zodiac? To phrenology? Where they belong. In the minds of mystics and weak-minded people. I remember that a newspaper in Baltimore added an interactive crime map to their website for while. You could examine crimes by type over several time periods and map their locations. It was all grins and giggles until someone posted a screen capture of homicides. The crime locations clustered around the predominately black neighborhoods with only a very few in other areas. It was quite the eye opener. But the map disappeared from the website shortly afterward without explanation. Below are the 30 cities with the highest murder rates. At least 28 of them have a black population above the national 13.2% average. Most are SUBSTANTIALLY higher than that average. The top ten worst cities likely ALL are predominantly (at least a plurality) black. Yet no researcher wants to consider race — a verboten topic regarding violent crime. http://www.neighborhoodscout.c…..te-cities/ The countdown for the Top 30 Murder Capitals of America: Rank City 30 Baton Rouge, LA 29 Youngstown, OH 28 San Bernardino, CA 27 Oakland, CA 26 Barberton, OH 25 Poughkeepsie, NY 24 Cincinnati, OH 23 Petersburg, VA 22 Wilmington, DE 21 York, PA 20 East Palo Alto, CA 19 Jackson, MS 18 Wilkes-Barre, PA 17 Birmingham, AL 16 East Point, GA 15 East Chicago, IN 14 Compton, CA 13 Baltimore, MD 12 St. Louis, MO 11 Harvey, IL 10 Newark, NJ 9 New Orleans, LA 8 Trenton, NJ 7 Detroit, MI 6 Flint, MI 5 Saginaw, MI 4 Chester, PA 3 Gary, IN 2 Camden, NJ 1 East St. Louis, IL BTW, it’s likely that most of these cities have ‘strong’ gun control laws. And all but 1 or 2 are controlled by the Democrat Party. But, of course, correlation does not prove causation, yada, yada, yada. Sorry, Richard, but cities controlled by Democrats isn’t the reason for the high homicide rates in these cities. These cities are more concentrated with persons having well below a decent standard of living, be it housing, schools, jobs, etc., and thus are more concentrated with minorities who face discrimination than the rest of the country. With little opportunity and little hope, the matter of life is of less importance. Living in poverty isn’t conducive to living a good life. Living in poverty isn’t conducive to living a good life. I’m an immigrant from a country where the majority lived below the US poverty line. Yet, there was very little violence. Poverty does not cause violence. What causes violence is dysfunctional government and dysfunctional culture. more concentrated with minorities who face discrimination than the rest of the country You’re right that these minorities face discrimination and hopelessness. And who is responsible for that? The schools that educated them, the social programs that raised them, the employers that discriminate against them, and the bureaucracies and regulations that keep them in poverty: overwhelmingly controlled by Democrats. Democratic policies promote violence in minority communities around the country, largely because that serves the political interests of the Democrats, just like Democrats used to promote segregation, eugenics, and slavery. Democrats are always about dividing people up by race, it’s only the details that change over time. It’s utterly reprehensible. Just an aside regarding the 30 highest murder rate cities. I suspect all but a handful (at most) have tough gun control laws. And I’m pretty sure that, with perhaps 1 or 2 exceptions, all are Democrat controlled cities. But of course, correlation does not prove causation, yada-yada-yada. It’s impossible to know how often guns are used in self-defense, because defending yourself with a gun doesn’t always require pulling the trigger. You can even defend yourself with a gun over the phone: “I bought a gun so stay the hell away from me.” How can anyone measure that? “I bought a gun so stay the hell away from me” What if you only said that but actually you were lying and didn’t buy a gun or have one in the first place? Actually an interesting point. If we could not own guns, then THREATENING to have a gun would be ineffective. By villains not knowing who is armed and who isn’t, our right to own firearms helps defends those that chose NOT to own firearms. Without that uncertainty, we’d ALL be at greater risk. The height of stupidity is making a threat that you can’t back up. I can and will back it up. “I can and will back it up.” No doubt those clowns in Oregon were saying the same thing. Guns lend themselves to this kind of bravado. If you’re lucky you’ll just end up in jail like our friends in Oregon. I think it was Kleck’s study that tried to give some basic measurement. My memory says the number of DGUs where no shots were fired was over 90%. As I recall only about 8% of DGUs involved actually discharging the gun and only about 2% resulted in a room temperature intruder. Seems that when a potential victim turns out to be armed the majority of criminals suddenly remember they’re overdue at church choir practice … or something. Doherty is also spot-on about why such things are not reported to police. And of course the media isn’t interested unless there’s a body, blood or flashing lights. A good article in general, but I’m disappointed that you don’t call out the one absolutely uncontroversial *causal* connection between gun laws and violence: the kidnapping and caging of those that violate those laws. I know it’s kind of standard libertarian rhetoric to say that a gun law “bans” guns, but in fact it does no such thing: guns don’t listen to bans. What a gun law does is make a violent threat: “if you do X [buy a gun, sell a gun, possess a gun, etc], then we *will* commit a violent act against you.” Any calculation of violence with respect to gun laws *has* to take into account the number of people who will be/have been jailed as a consequence. The divergence in gun ownership polls is based on citizenship and voters. The two polls that show downward trending household ownership rates survey anybody, and the two that show relatively stable rates poll only registered voters. http://www.gunfacts.info/blog/polling-pollution/ I find it a curious omission that an article which includes such prominent placement for the work of John Lott ignores the even more significant efforts in this field performed by Mary Rosh. This article is well written & reasoned by Mr. Doherty. . I’ve been around the gun debate for years. Names like David Hemenway Philip Cook, Ludwig, Wintemute, Kellerman, Zimring, et al are familiar names in anti-gun “research”. The drumbeat from all these people is always negative about firearms with little acknowledgement that firearms MAY be useful to certain people. It seems that the above authors have almost always been shown to have been wrong. Whether by cherry-picking their data to support their ideology or failing to account for the simplest of variables. More interesting is to look up the source of their research dollars. I’ll let the reader do their own research, however I will tell them to expect to find most are funded by a few left-wing foundations. With crime rates falling over the last 20 years, the anti-gun left has been forced to adopt a position against a new scourge — “Gun Violence.” This allows them to lump together different activities other than violent crime and murder to bolster their statistics. Though it’s curious that they get away with including suicide as “gun violence.” That’s like including self-abuse (masturbation) under the heading of “domestic violence.” These are separate and distinctly different problems requiring different approaches. Yet the left wishes to treat them the same. And if you propose a solution for one issue and they dismiss it because it doesn’t solve both issues (only banning guns will “solve” it).

This is wha- I do…… ?????? http://www.buzznews99.com Re: “But perhaps, and more plausibly, these laws are more readily enacted in states where the prevalence of firearm ownership is low?there will be less opposition to them?and firearm ownership confounds the association.” Excellent. Re: “…since it’s always possible that those more likely to be suicidal are more likely to want to own guns.” I’d say it’s not just possible but probable. Men commit suicide at a rate four times higher than do women, and men are much more likely than women to want to own and in fact possess a gun. Don’t tell my wife that. She carries and she is a damn good shot. However, most women that commit suicide prefer other means such as sleeping pills. Suicide by gun is a messy affair. Women also have a lot more unsuccessful suicides than men, in fact they attempt suicide far more often. So, its NOT that those that are “more suicidal” are more likely to own guns…the opposite in fact. Men are just far more effective at carrying it out, as they use a more, uh, decisive method.

I work through this link, go to tech tab for work detail. _+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+ http://www.Homesalary10.com The paper didn’t look at gun statistics in the context of overall violent crime, a much more relevant measure to the policy debate. After all, if less gun crime doesn’t mean less crime overall?if criminals simply substitute other weapons or means when guns are less available?the benefit of the relevant gun laws is thrown into doubt. This, along with lumping in suicides, is why it is almost impossible to have a rational discussion on this topic. The goal should not be to reduce “gun deaths”, it should be to reduce overall deaths. People looking for simple solutions to complex problems view these as directly correlated data points, and conclude that reducing the former will automatically reduce the latter. It’s like suggesting grounding all airplanes will reduce travel deaths because no one will die in plane crashes anymore — ignoring that, in the absence of air travel, people won’t simply start sitting at home. If you look at the worldwide data on gun ownership rates, homicide rates, and suicide rates, there is no correlation between the first one and the last two, on a country-by-country basis. The goal should not be to reduce “gun deaths”, it should be to reduce overall deaths. But the actual agenda is to promote the progressive agenda. You see the same with the slicing and dicing of “mass shooters”: after you put mass murders committed by Muslims, mass murders committed by black gang members, mass members committed by Hispanic gang members, and mass murders committed by women (mostly poisoning) into separate categories (“terrorism”, “gang violence”, “domestic violence”), you are miraculously left with a high proportion of white male mass murderers. Then, progressives can go to work and attribute “terrorism”, “gang violence”, and mass murdering women to “white male privilege and oppression”, and voila, you have it: white males and their guns are responsible for everything that ails America. Progressivism and its use of reason and science are impressive, aren’t they? My last pay check was $9500 working 12 hours a week online.

It so happens that the 85% experiences significantly less gun violence, homicides and suicides since they have much less gun ownership largely due to restrictive gun laws. All of what Doherry has written isn’t worth the paper on which it is written. His analysis falls apart when applied to Australia, Germany, UK, Scandinavian, countries, Russia, Japan, etc. For the love of Pete he can even explain our neighbor, Canada.

Sorry guys, when it comes to guns you lose. ‘It so happens that the 85% experiences significantly less gun violence, homicides and suicides since they have much less gun ownership largely due to restrictive gun laws. ‘ Japan has a higher suicide rate than America and has way less guns. His analysis falls apart when applied to Australia, Germany, UK, Scandinavian, countries, Russia, Japan, etc. For the love of Pete he can even explain our neighbor, Canada. Different countries and cultures have different homicide rates. That’s been true since colonial times. However, the simple fact is that gun violence in the US is almost entirely a problem of African Americans and Hispanics. If you factor out those populations, the US is not significantly more violent than European nations. It so happens that the 85% experiences significantly less gun violence, homicides and suicides since they have much less gun ownership largely due to restrictive gun laws.

If you are ready to ashcan that in the name of momentary expedience or ‘common sense’ why should I trust you to respect any other part of the Constitution? Write a Constitutional amendment allowing the government to regulate guns, and start trying to get it passed, and we’ll talk.

Just try it: http://03615gbnxbyy5y42r9r8o80…..kbank.net/ We take pride in the fact that our passion for better health and fitness is 100% backed by science and helps 100’s (if not 1000’s) of people every year since 2010. Is there a scientific consensus that it works? Thanks, but I think I’ll pass then. David Hemenway took to the pages of the Los Angeles Times to declare in a headline: “There’s scientific consensus on guns?and the NRA won’t like it.” Which only goes to illustrate again that “scientific consensus” and “scientific truth” are two unrelated concepts. Whenever someone starts using “science” and “consensus” in the same sentence, you are being had. Science is based on data and observation, not consensus. Appealing to consensus is merely a fallacious ad populum. Religion is based on consensus however. Did they just push an article from 2016 to the front page? Yeah, so what’s your point? “Despite the confident assertions of the gun controllers and decades of research, we still know astonishingly little about how guns actually function in society and almost nothing at all about whether gun control policies actually work as promised.” And that is fine, because none of it is relevant to the fact that the constitution says what it says. And no one tells a pollster the truth if they even talk to them at all. So all the polls on guns are as reliable as the ones that had what’s-her-name winning in a landslide.

Brooke Higgins, who was charged on Thursday, and Sienna Johnson, who was charged last week, will both be tried as adults on two counts of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, in a district court in Castle Rock, Colorado. The girls took what the prosecution called “overt acts” towards purchasing firearms in order to carry out their plan, assistant district attorney Jason Siers told the court on Thursday.  Mass shootings carried out by women are extremely rare – such attacks, defined by the FBI as a single event in which four or more people are killed, are nearly always perpetrated by men. In Mother Jones’s comprehensive count, out of 84 mass murder events since 1982, only three have involved women: San Bernardino, where one of two shooters was female; the shooting on a Native American reservation in Alturas, California, in 2014; and the postal shooting in Goleta, California, in 2006. Prosecutors said the two girls worshipped the Columbine shooters, and the movie Natural Born Killers. They had specific targets, the prosecution said, but everyone at the school was a potential victim. Entries on social networking sites show moody pictures of blood-spattered walls, and hand-scrawled journal entries filled with anguished prose. On Thursday, Higgins broke down in tears as district court judge Paul King set her bond at $1m, as he had for Johnson. The day before, Johnson also appeared emotional in court, watching proceedings with an expression of horror, her foot vibrating, her hands constantly worrying at a tissue. She has been scheduled for a psychological evaluation; Higgins has already had one, and was briefly on suicide watch, her lawyers told the court. Both were shackled, in pastel green prison jumpsuits. The cases are currently under seal, and a motion filed by a consortium of local television stations and the Guardian to remove that seal from the case file was denied by King, though he did allow the trials to take place in open court. Highlands Ranch, Colorado, is a satellite suburban town about 25 miles south of Denver. Nestled among snowy brush-covered hillocks, its skyline is dominated by the distant Rockies and little else. It is a town of cookie-cutter houses in uniform blue-grey and beige. Nearby, several town names echo with dismal significance. Columbine, probably America’s most infamous school shooting, is a quarter-hour drive north-west. Aurora, where 12 people were murdered at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises three years ago, is about a half-hour north-east. Colorado Springs, site of two shootings in as many months in October and November 2015, is an hour south. It was through an anonymous text hotline begun after the 1999 Columbine shooting that the Mountain Vista high school plot was supposedly uncovered. In fact, Columbine looms large over the whole alleged plot. On 10 December, according to the district attorney who confiscated and searched Higgins’s journal and phone, she took a picture of the road outside Columbine high school, and Googled the names of the shooters. She also wrote about how she wished she had done Columbine with them, the prosecution said. In setting the strict bond conditions for Higgins on Thursday, Judge King addressed the issue of the cult of Columbine directly. “The idea that the incident at Columbine is to be admired, that the people who did that are gods or heroes …” he paused. “There are parents in this city that want to make sure their kids are protected.” Johnson, according to a biography she posted to a blog, had an unsettled childhood. Her parents divorced when she was two, and she was shuttled from Colorado to Pennsylvania to Florida to South Carolina and back to Colorado again. She expressed anger at lacking a “normal” family; but also an interest in art and music. She says she began rebelling in seventh grade, and was kicked out of her father’s house. At the end of the biography, she wrote: “I still put all my time and energy into the things I enjoy most and hope to be the best I can be.” Much of Johnson’s social media, including her Facebook and Tumblr page has been taken offline, but some of it is still available in cached form. This is where the Natural Born Killers reference originates. Other posts are titled “my whole existence is flawed” and “kill yourself”. Photographs on her blog of hand-written journal entries and drawings and paintings point to an artistic talent – though also to an emotional turbulence. “Maybe if you hadn’t made me drunk at midnight I wouldn’t mourn in that hour,” she wrote around a drawing of clasped hands in prayer and a collage of roses. “I don’t need help / I’m just medicating / I’m not a junkie / I lost feeling,” she wrote. And nearby, the phrase “needle sick” hints at possible substance abuse. But she does not fit the mould of a loner disappearing entirely into an online world; she played in a band, called Riot Vision. The sheriff’s office and the district attorney have reportedly dropped hints about the evidence they found against Johnson. They claimed the girls had planned their attack in the days running up to Christmas, and that Johnson had practised shooting with BB guns. Authorities also said she had told them when she was arrested that, were she released, she would go back to plotting a shooting. Less is known publicly about Higgins. She suffers from depression and has been in therapy for it for two years, according to her defense lawyer. She has also struggled with drug abuse in the past. But she had an after-school job and was doing well in school. Her attorney has tried to distance Higgins from Johnson, saying that the two were “high school acquaintances” who had only briefly associated with each other. But, according to the prosecution, Johnson had written in her diary in 2015 about meeting someone “who’s got what it takes to … make this school a living fucking nightmare”. “God, Brooke and me will be unstoppable,” Johnson allegedly wrote. They said the girls had taken steps towards purchasing real firearms; that Higgins had Googled “how can underage people buy guns” and visited Armslist.com, a site known as the “Craigslist for guns”. Therein, the prosecution’s case goes, lies the conspiracy. “The illegality follows an agreement to do a mass shooting,” Spiers told the court. “When you go to websites that are selling guns, we do believe those are overt acts.” The argument put forward by Dagny Van Der Jagt, the lawyer defending Higgins, is that these searches by her client, while chilling, do not constitute a crime. She said the DA was accusing her of “thought crimes”, nothing more. She also tried to distance her client from Johnson. But the DA disagreed. “There was an agreement and they took steps to get weapons based on that agreement,” Spiers said. “They were friends, they hung out outside school, and prior to this had said things individually about shooting up the school, then when they got together they put that plan into motion.” Preliminary hearings in the two trials are set for the end of February for Higgins, and the beginning of March for Johnson.",2016-01-14 18:14:04,Two teenage girls face trial in Colorado for 'planning mass school shooting',,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

His latest film, The Hateful Eight, is set a few years after the American civil war and puts the spotlight on strained race relations as a black Union soldier (Samuel L Jackson’s Maj Marquis Warren) is thrown together with former Confederate soldiers – Walton Goggins as a South Carolinian sheriff and Bruce Dern as a general.  In an interview with the Telegraph, Tarantino said: “As we were making it, as the events of the last year and a half just kept happening, the movie became more relevant than we ever could have imagined.” The US has seen sustained racial unrest following the shooting of 18-year-old African American Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014. Further incidents have stoked the fire, including the mass shooting at Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, South Carolina, carried out by a white supremacist who had previously posed with the rebel flag, also known as the General Lee. Tarantino said: “All of a sudden, people started talking about the Confederacy in America in a way they haven’t before. I mean, I’ve always felt the rebel flag was some American swastika. And well, now, all of a sudden people are talking about it, and now they’re banning it, and now it’s not OK to have it on fucking licence plates, and coffee cups, and stuff. “And people are starting to question about stuff like statues of Bedford Forrest [the Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan grand wizard] in parks. Well, it’s about damn time, if you ask me.” The director also addressed his infamous interview with the Channel 4 News presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy three years ago, when he lost his cool about a question suggesting a link between violence in his films and violence in real life. Tarantino’s films, including Django Unchained, Reservoir Dogs and now The Hateful Eight, include high levels of violence and brutality. “I wasn’t going to give it to him,” he said of Guru-Murthy. “But one of the things that backs up my point is that in the last 25 years, when it comes to industrial societies, hands down the most violent cinema that exists in any one country is Japan. Sometimes grotesquely so. And as we all know, they have the least violent society of all. It’s just right there.”",2016-01-02 07:03:48,Quentin Tarantino says 'it's about damn time' US discussed its racist past,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
418,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/30/hillary-clinton-guns-bernie-sanders-iowa-emails,"Democratic frontrunner targets Bernie Sanders’ record and has increasingly sought to make gun control a wedge issue between her and the Vermont senator First published on Sat 30 Jan 2016 13.24 GMT Gabby Giffords still struggles with her speech, five years after she was shot in the head in a mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona.  But standing beside Hillary Clinton in Ames, Iowa, on Saturday, the former congresswoman said there were two words she looked forward to saying one year from now: “Madame President”. “Hillary is tough,” Giffords said at a rally with Clinton two days before the Iowa caucuses. “In the White House, she will stand up to the gun lobby. That’s why I’m voting for Hillary.” Giffords was joined by her husband, the retired astronaut Mark Kelly, with whom she co-founded the anti-gun violence group Americans for Responsible Solutions after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. They endorsed Clinton earlier this month, but Saturday marked their first appearance on the campaign trail. Clinton has increasingly sought to make gun control a wedge issue between her and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator with whom she is locked in an Iowa polling dead heat. The Clinton campaign has aggressively pushed the narrative that Sanders’ record on gun safety has, on occasion, been more aligned with the agenda of the National Rifle Association. In return, Sanders has consistently pointed to his D- rating from the NRA. “The facts cry out for action,” Clinton said of gun violence at the rally on Saturday, citing statistics showing roughly 33,000 gun-related deaths each year in America. “This is as important a challenge as I think we face here at home. “What is wrong with us? How can we continue to ignore the toll that this is taking on our children and on our country?” Clinton also dismissed opponents who argue that any tightening of gun laws would infringe upon the second amendment. “The actions we take can certainly be done consistent with the constitution and the right of gun owners,” she said. “That has never been a doubt unless you’re a paid lobbyist for the gun lobby.” Saturday’s busy campaign events – for candidates in both parties, ahead of voting on Monday – came at a tense time for the Clinton campaign. Not only are the polls close in Iowa, but on Friday the Obama administration confirmed for the first time that the unsecured home server Clinton used while secretary of state contained some of the US government’s most closely guarded secrets, censoring 22 emails containing material demanding one of the highest levels of classification. Clinton has constantly fought off attacks from Republican candidates over her use of private email while serving as the top US diplomat during Barack Obama’s first term in the White House. On Saturday morning in Iowa, she focused on gun control. In past campaign speeches and on the debate stage, Clinton has pointed to Sanders’ votes against the Brady bill – Reagan-era legislation that imposed federal background checks and a waiting period on gun purchases – and for a 2005 regulation that granted gun manufacturers legal immunity if weapons were used to commit crime. She has also pointed out that Sanders once voted in favor of the so-called “Charleston loophole” – the name for a provision under which a gun sale is required to proceed if a background check is not completed within three days. It was under this loophole that authorities said Dylann Roof, the gunman who killed nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina last June, was able to acquire his gun despite holding a previous drug offense. Sanders, who insists that he has been a tough opponent of the gun lobby and often points to his background in a rural state in which hunting is popular, this week said he now backs – and will in fact co-sponsor – efforts to repeal that 2005 law. Polls of the Democratic field in Iowa constantly show Clinton and Sanders within the margin of error: on Saturday the realclearpolitics.com average of polls in the state had Clinton at 46.8% and Sanders at 44.3%, with former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley way behind at 4.3%. For the Clinton campaign, such figures raise the specter of 2008, when defeat in the state by Obama presaged defeat, from a position of favoritism, in the wider Democratic primary. Sanders holds a healthy lead in New Hampshire, the next state to vote, though nationally Clinton leads by double digits. On Saturday morning, the New York Times announced that it was endorsing Clinton for the Democratic nomination. In a lengthy piece explaining its thinking, the Times’ editorial board compared the two candidates on key issues while dismissing O’Malley as “more suited for the jobs he has already had – governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore – than for president”. “Mrs Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms,” the board wrote. “Mr Sanders’ record on guns is relatively weak.” On the Republican side of the ledger, the Times board wrote: “Governor John Kasich of Ohio, though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race.” On Saturday in Iowa, Clinton appeared at campaign events with her husband, former president Bill Clinton, and her daughter Chelsea. Sanders was also due to host a number of events in Iowa, including an evening rally featuring performances from musical supporters Vampire Weekend and Foster the People.",2016-01-30 08:24:08,"Clinton targets Sanders and gun control, but email news hangs over Iowa caucus",,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

420,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/06/san-bernardino-shooting-enrique-marquez-weapons,"Enrique Marquez faces up to 50 years in federal prison if convicted on charges that also include conspiring with one of the attackers to commit other attacks Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.16 BST The man accused of illegally supplying the weapons used in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, pleaded not guilty to five federal charges on Wednesday, including conspiring with one of the shooters to commit separate and unrealized terror attacks. Enrique Marquez, 24, who appeared in US district court in Riverside, California, faces up to 50 years in federal prison if convicted on all of the charges.Prosecutors say Marquez was the “straw purchaser” of two of the guns used in the attack on the Inland Regional Center, on 2 December, by his childhood friend Syed Rizwan Farook and Farook’s wife, Tashfeen Malik. Fourteen people were killed and another 20 wounded before the shooters were killed by police later that day.  The trial start was set for 23 February, with another hearing scheduled for 8 February. The prosecutor, US attorney Jay Robinson, estimates that the government’s case will take 12 to 14 days. The doughy 24-year-old appeared in a white, collared jumpsuit with hands cuffed and chained in front of him, speaking politely when addressing the judge, Sheri Pym. It was the first time he has spoken publicly to address the charges since his name surfaced in relation to the attacks. Marquez’s wife, Mariya Chernykh, who is a relative of Farook’s, did not appear in court on Wednesday. Marquez was denied bail and has been in federal custody since being charged by prosecutors on 17 December. He spoke with investigators for more than a week, waiving his right to a lawyer daily and in writing. Authorities also say Marquez provided material support to terrorists. While being questioned by the FBI, Marquez said he had plotted terrorist attacks with Farook in 2011 and 2012, according to the 36-page affidavit used to initially charge Marquez. He is also accused of immigration fraud by entering into a sham green card marriage with Chernykh, who is a Russian national. Marquez told the FBI he was being paid $200 a month for the marriage, the affidavit says. Just after the shooting, Marquez drove to the beach and called 911 claiming suicidal thoughts, telling the dispatcher, “I’m involved”, and saying that he had bought the guns used in the attack for “the guy from San Bernardino”, according to an FBI affidavit. He also posted a cryptic, misspelled apology on Facebook: “I’m. Very sorry sguys. It was a pleasure.” Marquez was subsequently put on a 72-hour psychiatric hold at a UCLA hospital in the South Bay. When Marquez’s mother, Amrida Chacon, visited him at the hospital he told her that he didn’t know Farook was going to attack the center, using profanity to describe Farook, the affidavit says. The document also says that Marquez’s family did not know of his marriage to Chernykh until they visited him in the hospital. However, the FBI says that Chernykh lives with the father of her child, Oscar Romero, in the nearby town of Ontario, California. Neighbors said they had not seen Romero for days, and that it had been weeks since they had seen Chernykh, whom they say Romero always referred to as his wife and the mother of his young daughter. The house was decorated in Christmas lights that were not switched on.A knock on the door at the home of Farook’s brother and sister-in-law went unanswered earlier this week, as well as a note left for the family. Neighbor Brittani Adams said Marquez’s and Farook’s shared sister-in-law, Tatiana Farook, was escorted by men in “expensive dark suits who said they were the Corona police” a few weeks ago and only returned recently.Prosecutors have laid out a narrative in which Farook and Marquez bonded over video games and cars as teenage neighbors, and later, over videos preaching jihad. Marquez converted to Islam in 2007 and irregularly attended prayers at the Islamic Center of Corona, which is listed as the site of his 2014 marriage to Chernykh on the county marriage certificate. However, the mosque has distanced itself from Marquez and denies it officiated the wedding.“We went through all the records for the last two years and we didn’t find him getting married over here,” Yousuf Bhaghani, president of the board of directors of the mosque said. “Also, we only had one assigned person who performed those ceremonies, and he does not recall marrying him at all. Especially if you look at it, he is Hispanic and his wife is Russian. You would not forget them.”",2016-01-06 13:32:16,Man pleads not guilty to supplying weapons used in San Bernardino attack,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
421,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/04/donald-trump-first-tv-ad-2016-president,"We watched it and broke it down into its most thrilling, vile highlights so you don’t have to Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 19.19 GMT Unemployed television presenter Donald Trump released his first television ad on Monday, signaling that he has begun the “running for president” stage of his campaign. Until now, Trump has been content selling his trademarked brand of barely restrained hysteria via Saturday Night Live hosting gigs and rallies that resemble a scene from The Dark Knight Rises more than a political speech. I’m sincerely expecting Trump to walk out in a giant coat and a gas mask to declare that he’s planted a bomb in Gotham City and the triggerman will remain a mystery.  In fact, I’d happily vote for Trump if he promised to give his entire inauguration speech in the Bane voice. Or the Borat voice. Or the Austin Powers voice. Or any voice from a movie. I happen to love impressions and catchphrases, which is why I usually write in Shrek every election. I think Trump fancies himself more of a Batman figure, though. His first TV commercial positions him as a lone voice of reason in a corrupt world, a sour vigilante who has had enough of the bureaucrats and sycophants. It doesn’t go so far as to claim his parents were gunned down in an alley or that the Joker has contaminated our water supply, but the election isn’t until November. He’s got time. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ve got a whole 30 seconds of Trumpy nonsense to explore. I’ve broken down the commercial into its most thrilling, vile highlights so that you can better understand the complicated, high-level thinking that went into designing Trump’s campaign platform. We open on Trump, orating in front of a throng of adoring supporters. As usual, Trump looks like the robotic suit the talking brain named Krang used to get around on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, except in this case there’s no brain piloting his body that we know of. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton show up early, the gravelly-voiced narrator informing us that they are politicians, the most heinous offense imaginable in the nightmare alternate universe in which Trump lives. Instead of politician meaning “person qualified to run the most powerful nation in the world”, it refers to a hateful demon hoarding tax money and plotting to melt your guns and sculpt the liquid metal into a statue of a middle finger pointing toward a Lutheran church. Fortunately for us, Trump is no politician. In fact, he has no relevant experience in governing anything except for a golf course in Dubai. Those “politicians” can call it whatever they want – “it” being the San Bernardino mass shooting – but Trump declares it radical Islamic terrorism. Trump understands the power of words! Words like “loser”, “dummy”, “idiot”, “ugly”, “clown” and “goofball”. To be fair, these are some of my favorite words and they were liberally sprinkled throughout most reviews of The Apprentice. The ad goes on to remind the viewer that Trump is calling for a ban on Muslims entering the US. I’m still a bit hazy on how he’ll be able to differentiate between Muslim and non-Muslim would-be immigrants. It’s not as though every Arab is a Muslim; nor is every Muslim an Arab. You might be surprised to find out that some Muslims are white! Boy, is that going to make for a lot of conflicted Trump voters. Helpfully, the ad flashes a photo of some dastardly terrorists doing terroristy things like “Ooooh, look at them.” I bet they’re really hating America under all those cool sweaters. I know a terrorist when I see one and those are definitely terrorists who should not be allowed in the country! So, as long as every Muslim trying to get into the country wears a black hood over their face and has an AK-47 strapped to their back, we should be fine. Let’s move on. The narrator says that this ban will continue until we “figure out what’s going on”. This implies that we do not know what’s going on and assumes that we don’t spend billions of dollars every day to answer such a banal, vague question as “what’s happenin’?” This is yet another rhetorical masterstroke for Trump because the threshold for figuring it out is entirely up to his discretion. Four years from now, Trump could appear before Congress at the State of the Union and explain how we still don’t know what’s going on “over there” and the ban must continue. Whatever you say, President Trump, as long as you keep me safe, cut my taxes and let me marry my pistol – who, by the way, is a woman. The Donald promises to “cut the head off of Isis”, which is hilarious because as we all are painfully aware, Isis actually does cut people’s heads off. This is the least convincing claim in an advertisement stuffed with nonsense. Isis and other terrorist organizations do not function with top-down org charts like they’re a traditional army or a Walmart. There’s no head to cut off, just a series of slimy tentacles. That’s the right’s greatest regret when they reflect on their latest bogeyman. Where’s the charismatic leader? At least al-Qaida had Osama bin Laden. Now there was a bad guy worthy of a Die Hard film. There were videos of him giving speeches and shooting rifles and shaking hands with other terrorists. Every few months, he’d drop a new diss track directed at the US, giving us all someone to unload on when hitting the shooting range in Las Vegas. Think about the boost to our economy directly related to the manufacture and sale of Osama merchandise. What a bonanza! Hard to sell Isis swag without a mascot to help the brand penetrate the competitive American tchotchke market. I didn’t see a single “Iuck Fsis” beer koozie or “I CalipHATE Islamic State” mouse pad during Christmas season, and I do all my shopping at Spencer’s Gifts. If Trump really wants to win this election, I suggest he invent a leader for Isis. Something like a cyborg lizard man with a robotic eye that shoots laserbeams. Mohammed, the Lizardman. You can have that one for free, Trump. Back to the Trump classics, as we get a shot of some people storming a wall. Wait. There’s a wall there already? Why do we need to build another one? That wall seems to be working just fine. I mean, in that footage, it looks like all those people walk up to the wall and stop. That’s what walls do, typically. I don’t know what that is, since the ad helpfully avoids telling the viewer where they got that footage. It could be a group of over-caffeinated moms storming a Best Buy on Black Friday, for all we know. I guess the important bit here is that the Mexican government will be paying for this extraneous wall thing. He hasn’t explained how he’ll get them to spend an exorbitant amount of money on a public works project they (and half of the American public) do not want, besides invoking his expert negotiating skills, but I guess that would be hard to explain in 30 seconds. Maybe he’ll build it and then send them an invoice later. Just expect it to take longer than a month to process. The ad ends with Trump reciting his hot new catchphrase: “Do I make you horny, baby?” Definitely a weird twist there, but certainly appreciated. Up until that point, I was on the fence (or “border wall,” if you will) about voting for Trump, but he finally said all I wanted him to say. I’ve packed up my family and snuck into Trump’s big tent under cover of darkness. With those six words, he convinced me that he’s the right man for the job. I’m just surprised it took him this long.

06:28 You can read our latest article on Obama’s gun control town hall – and the NRA response – here: 2.21am GMT
02:21 The difference in style could not have been more stark. At Trump’s rally in Bernie Sanders’ hometown of Burlington, Vermont, protesters were thrown out en masse - and people who did not swear allegiance to Trump were not allowed in. A bombastic Trump said that gun free zones in schools were “bait” for “sickos.” Outside, a large crowd of protesters gathered, chanting Bernie Sanders’ name. At the same time, president Obama held a townhall meeting on CNN to discuss gun violence with a range of audience questions from people across the spectrum, from a rape victim who wanted to be reassured that she would still be able to protect herself, to a sheriff who wanted to know if he would be able to enforce the law, to Mark Kelly, the husband of Gabrielle Giffords, the representative who was shot in Arizona in a mass shooting attack. The president’s cool demeanor frayed only once; when challenged over his use of the term “conspiracy” over whether his government wanted to take people’s guns from them en masse. “Yes! I think it’s fair to call it a conspiracy [theory]!” he said. Earlier in the day he wrote an op-ed in the New York Times pledging not to support or campaign for any candidate who did not support gun control legislation. 2.13am GMT
02:13 “Some of the proposals I’m making mightnot be as effective as others,” he says. “But let’s not assume every few weeks there’s a mass shooting; every few months there’s one that gets national publicity; every day people get shot on the streets and nobody hears about it.” “We can do better, if we come together,” he ends. 2.09am GMT
02:09 Tre Bosley, whose brother Terrell was shot and killed 10 years ago, says he’s lost “countless friends and family members” to gun violence. “Most of us aren’t thinking of our life on a long term scale. Most of us are thinking minute-to-minute.” He asks what advice the president has for him. “You know - when I see you, I think about my own youth,” Obama says. “I probably wasn’t that different from you. But I lived in a more forgiving environment. If I screwed up, there wasn’t much risk of being shot.” He pauses. “And - that’s how all kids should grow up. Wherever they live.” 2.05am GMT
02:05 Cooper asks about Obama’s New York Times pledge not to support any candidate who does not support gun control reform. “The majority of people in this country are a lot more sensible than those in Washington,” he says. “And the reason Washington doesn’t work well, is the loudest, shrillest voices, the least compromising, the most powerful, or those with the most money have the most influence.” The way Washington changes is when people vote. The way we break the deadlock on this issue is when ... the NRA doesn’t have a stranglehold on congress. 2.02am GMT
02:02 Mark Kelly, the astronaut husband of rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in a mass shooting event in Arizona, asks “with 350m guns, if the federal govt wanted to confiscate those objects, how would they do that.” “First of all, every time I see Gabby, I’m thrilled, because I visited her in the hospital,” Obama says. “As we left the hospital to go to a memorial service, we had word that she opened her eyes for the first time.” Giffords is here too. Obama says mistrust of the federal government “is in our DNA.” He calls it a conspiracy - which Cooper disputes. For the first time, Obama seems visibly angry. “Yes! I think it’s fair to call it a conspiracy [theory]!” “It’s a false notion circulated with political intent, which prevents us coming together to make us safer. The notion that we can’t agree on some things while not agreeing on others, and the notion is, well, the president secretly wants to do x - would mean that we’d be paralysed on everything.” 1.57am GMT
01:57 Outside Trump’s event, a large crowd of Bernie Sanders supporters is gathering, the Guardian’s Ben Jacobs reports. Giant crowd outside Trump rally shouting Bernie Sanders pic.twitter.com/qEuOn2Fvtw 1.51am GMT
01:51 “There are conspiracy theories floating around the internet all the time,” Obama says. He points to Jade Helm, the training exercise in Texas. “People were convinced it was the start of martial law.” Then, he starts talking about smart gun technologies - weapons that only work if the wearer of a certain bracelet has their hand on the trigger. He says manufacturers backed off their development after pressure from the NRA. “That doesn’t make sense to me. I would think people would want the choice,” he says. “It has not been developed primarily because it has been blocked by the NRA. So what we proposed was, we’ll do some of the research, and then give everybody a choice, because I think there will in fact be a market for that.” 1.45am GMT
01:45 CNN just replayed this footage of Obama’s tearful moment recalling the Newtown massacre a couple of days ago. Speaking to Cooper, Obama says that when he visited Newtown two days after the attack, that was the only time he’d ever seen Secret Service members cry on duty. “As I enter into my last year as president, I could not be prouder of the work that we’ve done, but it also makes me really humble. A lot of the work you do is just to incrementally make things better,” he says, speaking with unusual candor. Whenever he talks about the “mischaracterisation” of his views on the subject, his frustration is palpable. 1.40am GMT
01:40 Trump, too, is addressing the question of guns. And he’s come to very different conclusions to the president. “We need our guns,” @realDonaldTrump says, talking about guns extensively as his rally hits the hour mark. #GunsInAmerica The contrasting delivery style between the two men is stark. “You know what a gun free zone is to a sicko?” Trump just said, according to Ben on the scene. “That’s bait!” He pledges to get rid of them in schools on his first day in office. As Donald Trump calls for more of the good guys to be armed, a guy in the Secret-Service-screened crowd shouts: ""Not tonight!"" 1.37am GMT
01:37 Back to Obama, who’s talking about the Newtown massacre. “Everybody here is in favour of going after criminals ... creating an environment where kids don’t turn into criminals,” Obama says. “What we have to [also] do is make sure it’s not so easy for them to get access to deadly weapons.” 1.30am GMT
01:30 Meanwhile, in Burlington, the scene at Trump’s rally appears to be worsening, with more and more protesters - and those suspected of being protesters - being thrown out into the Vermont cold Trump is urging security to confiscate protesters' coats. Trump: ""Confiscate his coat. It’s about 10 degrees below zero outside. Keep his coat. Tell him we’ll send it to him in a couple of weeks."" And now another round of protesters shouting ""Trump is a racist."" On stage, Trump complains security is taking too long I can't keep track of the number of protesters in the rally right now as they get removed and removed ""We'll get more and more angry as we go along,"" Trump warns for protesters as more are escorted out.

01:25 “Do you think a good guy with a gun can be a bulwark against a bad guy with a gun,” Cooper asks. Throws the question to Kimberly Corban, a rape survivor, who says that being able to buy a firearm is “a basic responsibility as a parent at this point.” “First of all, obviously, your story is horrific,” Obama says. He praises her strength in telling it. “I just want to repeat that there’s nothing we’ve proposed that would make it harder for you to get a firearm.” “There really is nothing we’re proposing that makes it harder for you to purchase a firearm if you need one.” “There are always questions about whether or not having a firearm in the home protects you from that kind of violence,” he adds. “I’m not sure we’re going to be able to resolve it.” 1.20am GMT
01:20 The first question for President Obama comes from Taya Kyle, the widow of Chris Kyle, on whom the book American Sniper was based. She worries that the laws will not be followed by the murderers. “Would it be a better use of our time to give people hope in a different way?” She says that America is at an all-time low for murder rate. Obama says that the low violent crime rate “is not something that we celebrate enough ... most cities are much safer than they were.” He disputes the idea that the reason for that is high gun ownership, saying that the places with higher gun ownership are often places where the violent crime rate hasn’t dropped as much. But, he tells Taya, “you will still be able to buy a firearm.” 1.16am GMT
01:16 “We’re trying to do something modest, and the response is that we’re trying to take away everybody’s guns,” Obama says. He says his position has been “mischaracterised.” He laments the NRA’s lack of attendance. “We have invited them repeatedly, but if you listen to the rhetoric, it is so over the top - and not acknowledging the fact that there is no other consumer item we purchase ... theres nothing else in our lives that we purchase that we don’t try to make it a little safer if we can.” He points to the fact that traffic fatalities have reduced drastically in his lifetime. “The notion that we would not apply the same basic principles to gun ownership ... or the notion that everything we do is somehow a plot to take away guns, that contradicts what we do to try to create a better life for Americans in any other area of life.” He says he’s happy to meet with the NRA, but “the conversation has to be based on truth.” 1.12am GMT
01:12 Now the president is talking about his executive action on Tuesday to shrink the private sale loophole. “We want to put everybody on notice that the def of doing bus - which means you have to run a background check - is if you are making a profit and selling multiple guns.” Cooper points out that this is, perhaps, not specific enough. “Ultimately, it’s up to Congress to set up a system that is efficient,” Obama says. “The fact that the system may not catch every single person,” he says, is outweighed by the fact that it could save lives. 1.08am GMT
01:08 Back to Obama. “I respect the Second Amendment, I respect the right to bear arms. I respect sportsmanship,” he says. “...but when you’re losing 30,000 people to firearms, two thirds of them suicides...” He says he wants to combine gun safety with sensible background checks. “If we can take that 30,000 to, say, 28,000, that’s two thousand families who don’t have to go through what the families of Newtown had to go through,” he says. 1.06am GMT
01:06 In Burlington, a brief interruption to Trump’s speech: Protesters come through wearing signs that say ""dump Trump"" and shouting it. They get escorted out. Trump supporters are now deciding that random attendees are hecklers and should be kicked out and security is following suit A few people just kicked out but unclear why. I didn't hear them cheer against Trump. Girl was upset to leave saying ""I didnt do anything."" And then security kicks them out when they insist they have done nothing wrong https://t.co/h5AJbBpD8h",2016-01-07 15:44:50,Bill Clinton stumps in Iowa as Trump visits Sanders' hometown – live updates,"politics and government,united states politics and government,gun control,crime and criminals,sex crimes,firearms,demonstrations and riots",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
423,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/16/republican-marco-rubio-immigration-questions-attacks-ted-cruz-donald-trump,"As Republican rivals seize on policy changes, senator who coauthored reform bill hopes tough stance will stymie critics and attract votes First published on Sat 16 Jan 2016 13.00 GMT On a chilly January weekend, as Marco Rubio kicked off the most important year of his political career, two voters offered competing advice on how he should address immigration – an issue that has roiled the race for the Republican presidential nomination.  Under attack over a comprehensive immigration reform bill he helped craft in 2013, which drew widespread conservative ire over its inclusion of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, the Florida senator found himself on defense. Negative advertisements, sponsored predominantly by allies of Ted Cruz, the Texas senator and immigration hardliner, painted Rubio as a proponent of so-called “amnesty”. As Rubio addressed a packed crowd in Hampton, one woman asked: why not take a page from Barack Obama and deliver a speech on a “more perfect union”? It was a reference to the 2008 address in which the future president responded to controversial remarks by his former pastor with a sweeping address on race, religion and politics. As the son of Cuban immigrants, the voter said, Rubio was uniquely positioned to reset the narrative. Less than 24 hours later, less than an hour away, Rubio encountered the opposite view. A second woman said she had discussed Rubio’s candidacy with others and was troubled to learn he was “soft” on immigration. He would need to assure her that was not the case. The immigration question has been an evolving one for Rubio, who if elected president would be the first Latino to occupy the White House. But in Thursday night’s presidential debate in North Charleston, South Carolina, the senator set before millions of viewers the approach he plans to take in the home stretch of the Republican primary. Asked about his immigration bill and its proposed expansion of green cards for foreign workers, Rubio sidestepped, seeking to recast the topic as a matter of national security. The issue, he said, was now “dramatically different” than two years ago, due to the emergence of “a group of radical crazies named Isis”. “Our No 1 priority must now become ensuring that Isis cannot get killers into the United States,” Rubio said. “So whether it’s green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I’m president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.” The following morning, his campaign launched two new TV ads. In one – a direct response to an ad by a pro-Jeb Bush Super Pac that accused Rubio of flip-flopping on immigration – Rubio vowed to undo Obama’s executive orders, cut funding for so-called “sanctuary cities”, finish 700 miles of border wall, add 20,000 border agents and deport “criminal aliens”. “When I’m president, there will be no amnesty,” Rubio said. The urgency with which Rubio now presents a tougher demeanor stands in stark contrast to the greater part of last year. After launching his candidacy in April at Miami’s Freedom Tower, the first stop for Cuban exiles fleeing Fidel Castro’s regime from 1962 to 1974, Rubio largely spoke of immigration through the story of his parents. Only in America, he said, could immigrants who worked as a bartender and a maid leave their son in a position to run for president. But unless asked by a voter or a reporter, Rubio seldom brought up immigration reform. He did, nonetheless, lay out a three-step plan that would secure the border, modernize legal immigration and promote visas for high-skilled workers, and finally determine how to bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. He almost never uttered the word “amnesty” and, when pressed, acknowledged being “personally” open to green cards for law-abiding undocumented immigrants. It was not until late December, as he and Cruz escalated their feud, that Rubio began to raise the subject of immigration in his stump speech – but only to emphasize that as president, he would “enforce the law”. In recent weeks, he has made the case that immigration is inextricably linked to terrorism. There may be no other option in a primary where a majority of Republicans are rankled by national security concerns and more skeptical of immigrants than in any recent election. Polling in recent months found that a significant faction of voters favor the extreme line drawn by frontrunner Donald Trump, including his proposed ban on Muslim immigration. That the roughly 11 million undocumented migrants living in the US are now being conflated with the Syrian refugee crisis is a byproduct of Trump’s dominance. Trump’s first TV ad invoked the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, touted his proposed moratorium on Muslim migrants and alluded to terrorists streaming across the southern border. Although he has rejected a religious test for entry into the US, Rubio’s stance on refugees has changed. He was among the first candidates to say the US should allow them in, a stance he reversed after the terrorist attacks in Paris in November. He then suggested he was open to the admission of “commonsense” individuals that could be vetted, such as elderly women, children and Chaldean priests. On the stump, Rubio compares the refugee question to locking one’s door. There was a time when people did not do so, he says, before observing that the world has changed. “When you lock your doors, it’s not because you hate the people outside of your home,” he often says. “You lock your doors because you love the people inside.” Rubio’s opponents have pointed out that terrorist groups hardly cropped up overnight. Immediately after Thursday’s debate, his critics resurrected a clip from 2013 following the Boston Marathon bombing – an event that coincided with negotiations over Rubio’s immigration bill. Then, Rubio urged skeptics to “keep in perspective” that the bombers were just two migrants and any lessons learned could be worked into his legislation. Today, he insists national security has prompted him to rethink immigration entirely. What that means for his appeal to Latino voters remains to be seen. For now, he must fend off attacks from his right, as from Cruz and Trump, and from those who agree with him on broader policy issues. On Friday, Bush, who once praised Rubio’s work on immigration, knocked the senator over what he deemed to be a lack of leadership. “Marco cut and run, plain and simple, for whatever reason,” Bush told reporters in South Carolina. The former Florida governor had just earned the endorsement of Senator Lindsey Graham, a coauthor of Rubio’s immigration bill in 2013 who dropped out of the race last month. On the campaign trail, Rubio portrays his twists and turns as a matter of pragmatism. He has also taken to reminding voters that he knows the issue. “My entire family is immigrants,” Rubio told the New Hampshire voter who suggested he had a “soft” reputation, also citing his West Miami community. “I understand the good, the bad, and the ugly, and every aspect of it. I know the story of people who are here illegally, and it would break your heart. And I know the story of people that are here legally, whose stories would boil your blood. “No one who has ever run for president understands this issue personally better than I do and that’s why I can tell you and you should tell your friends that no one running for president is better prepared to fix it than me.” It brought his loudest applause of the morning.",2016-01-16 08:40:39,Marco Rubio's twists and turns on immigration become red meat for rivals,"politics and government,united states politics and government,elections,presidents and presidency (us),presidential elections (us),election issues,immigration and refugees",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

1.5.2016 3:37 PM As Jacob Sullum has already pointed out today at Reason, most of the specifics of President Obama's lengthy and emotional announcement of various executive actions allegedly intended to curb gun violence, which he framed specifically as a reaction to a series of public mass-shooting tragedies, would have done nothing to prevent those tragedies. Sullum has also pointed out that the combination of encouraging more mental health treatment along with tougher attempts to keep a class of people who seek that treatment from exercising their Second Amendment rights is likely to discourage people from seeking treatment. With its core content irrelevant to its framed political purpose (about a political problem that the vast majority of the American people consider very low on their list of priorities), the rest of Obama's gun speech today nonetheless devolved into a political rally. He called for people to vote for politicians who will, like Obama, advocate for tougher access to guns, whether or not we have reason to believe doing so will deal with the problem of gun violence. That problem is not a growing epidemic but something that has shrunk in half in the past 23 years. The parts of the speech about better gun safety technologies also obviously have nothing to do with all the tragic tales with which he buttressed the alleged purpose of the speech. Such technologies may well be a great thing for those that want them. If gun owners overwhelmingly want better computerized trigger locks, child safety devices and the like, and perhaps they do, they will eventually have them, if they are willing to pay for them. But people who want guns for instant emergency self defense might not want a weapon only as easy to use instantly as a locked iPhone. People who can't afford high-tech gadgets might want access to a self-defense weapon that is not an expensive high-tech gadget. And when this constitutional-law-professor-and-don't-you-forget-it president rhetorically deals with the issue of pre-emptively denying a core constitutional right to people based on pure government suspicion by merely saying that ""that's not right…that can't be right"" that the government should be denied this power when it comes to terror suspects buying guns, he's arguing from a position of pure desire to accrue more raw power to the government. Obama also made calls for more (government-funded) research into gun violence, while at the same time showing exactly why those who respect gun rights are skeptical of such research: it is often incredibly shoddy and tendentious and used to back political proposals to restrict gun access that the ""research"" doesn't actually support. Obama claimed today that ""research"" had proven that tougher gun access and permit laws caused a 40 percent gun homicide reduction in Connecticut and that easier gun access laws cause a huge gun homicide increase in Missouri. Both studies are discussed in my February Reason feature ""You Know Less Than You Think About Guns,"" and neither conclusion is proven true. When politicians use research to make untrue claims to back up their call for tougher legal access to guns, those who respect gun rights understandably don't trust them. They also don't trust it when politicians like Obama make it clear their political target is not people killing people with guns, but rather people having guns. His whole quasi-sophisticated ""rights balancing"" talk about how our freedom of religion and freedom to assemble are harmed by people who wander into churches and gatherings and kill people with guns makes this clear. Because the government has already made it illegal to do such things. There do not need to be more laws making it clear that such behavior isn't tolerated in our constitutional republic. What Obama wants to do is make it harder for more people to get guns, a whole different matter, as the vast, vast majority of the people affected by such laws will not use them to ""violate freedom of religion"" by shooting up a church. But the key giveaway, the reason why this gun issue that seems so common sense to Obama and his fans is so politically contentious, is because Obama makes it very clear (though perhaps inadvertently) that in a game of positing gun violence as always, in whatever amount, so unacceptable it demands more laws, and then positing laws that will likely have almost no independent effect on gun violence, that the game of ratcheting gun laws more and more has no foreseeable end. Obama kept nodding to how hard it is to stop gun violence, or maybe to pass gun laws, it was unclear which, though admittedly both are hard (and they are not the same thing). And he concluded: ""tomorrow we should do more, and do more the day after that."" President Obama, that attitude is exactly why the politics of gun control—sorry, ""common sense gun safety""— is so hard. Because we see you are seeking a goal that is unreachable in a world where guns and the legal right to own them still exists, and you want to do ""more"" and ""more"" to reach that goal.

You mean to tell me we put a man on the moon, but we can’t find a suitable replacement for oil create a suitable gun lock? Fucking corporations, man. What shitstains like Obama don’t realize is the gun “lock” is the deadbolt on my front door, the locks on my car doors and the snap keeping my gun strapped inside my holster. Once somebody breaks through one of those “locks”, (or in the case of the holster, once I’ve been forced to unsnap it, then they have violated the sanctity of my private property to the point that they are subject to being shot in self defense. Piss on this turd. A locked up gun is worthless for self defense. They know that I think and view people not being able to defend themselves as a good thing. I wish you were exaggerating, but that’s literally the law in Canada – self-defense is not a valid reason for handgun licence. There are a few purposes for which individuals can be licensed to acquire or possess a restricted firearm, the most common being target practice or target shooting competitions, or as part of a collection. In limited circumstances, restricted firearms are also allowed for use in connection with one’s lawful profession or occupation, or to protect life. (protection of life is for Protectors of The Worthy, of course) Nothing like outsourcing self-defense to a union member. Whose best interest is (a) not doing anything, (b) letting you die and (c) blaming it on “lack of public funding”. Oh yeah? Who are you gonna call to protect you shoot your dog when the bad guys come to your house? Huh? The only reliable safety is the one between your ears. My wife and I were talking about gun locks last night; we recently had a child and will, very soon, have to deal with him being mobile, curious, etc. We want to keep him safe, but we also don’t want to prevent ourselves from using a tool when it is needed. We came to the conclusion that our best bet was education. From a parent- you can’t educate a 1-year old not grab something that’s sitting out. They grab everything. Education is fine when the kid is older, but when they’re little, make certain the gun is not accessible. I’m in a similar situation. I was raised around guns, as was my wife, so we have a little bit of experience from the child’s end. In any case, we agree that teaching proper gun safety from as early as possible (never touch a gun without an adult’s permission, never point a gun at someone you’re not going to shoot, all guns are loaded unless you’ve personally cleared the action, etc.) is the best bet, but in the meantime just keeping guns out of reach is a pretty easy win. Once my daughter’s old enough to climb on a chair to reach something she’ll also be old enough to learn about guns. This, ours is completely out of reach from our eldest (and unloaded) while still being quickly accessible by the parents. By the time he is remotely close to being able to figure out the logistics of getting to that object he doesn’t even know about he will also be old enough to be taught correct handling, safety and not to ever touch it on his own. Your best bet is probably to just buy a high quality gun safe that you can get into quickly if necessary but that your kid can’t open. You’re not going to be able to educate a little kid about guns…they’ll pick up just about anything just because they’re kids. Don’t they have pretty cheap gun safes that can be activated by thumbprint now? This would seem to give you quick access to the weapon while you need it while preventing anyone else from getting a hold of it. One solution is to just wear it if you aren’t gonna keep it in a safe. A tiny pistol in a good holster is light enough that while you’ll know its there, it won’t be uncomfortable. Keeping it unloaded and out of reach was what I first did when my child was born 7 years ago. I bought a safe last year. I live smack dab in the middle of a pretty safe subdivision in a very safe suburb, so I’ll take the trade off between less accessible in the case of emergency for more peace of mind. Now that my daughter is 7, I’ll teach her the basics of marksmanship and gun safety with my BB gun, once the snow melts. I figure he was talking about ‘smart guns’ For that I would say that ‘smart guns’ are ready for prime time when the Secret Service purges its stock of dumb guns, and exclusively uses smart guns for Presidential Protection (I seriously doubt they would ever agree to that), and technology of the same reliability that is used for Presidential Protection adds negligible costs. No one wants either…. Nobody claimed that technology can’t create a wide variety of gun locks that would appeal to some gun owners. The issue is “who chooses?” The gun owner or the government? President Obama, that attitude is exactly why the politics of gun control?sorry, “common sense gun safety”? is so hard. The politics are not hard at all. They are in fact very easy. I can’t imagine anything easier than “fuck you, you are not getting your superstitious bullshit gun control”. What is so hard about “no”? How about this – (a) If you can’t be trusted with a gun, you certainly can’t be trusted delegating power to a bunch of soldiers and cops with guns, so you should be stripped of the right to vote. (b) If a citizen is qualified to vote, that citizen is qualified to bear arms. Laws like this will shut the Dems up, since the people they want to disarm are either Democratic voters or targets of Dem campaign appeals. Their ideal is a bunch of disarmed sheeplike followers pulling the lever for them at every election and then doing as they’re told. Eddie, that’s a good talking point. Their ideal is a bunch of disarmed sheeplike followers pulling the lever for them at every election and then doing as they’re told. That is, roughly speaking, the state of the modern Democratic party. The Democratic party, today, is essentially composed of an poor, uneducated, class of kept clients overseen by a overeducated mandarinate that fancies itself intellectually superior. As long as the clients remain loyal and don’t interfere with the internecine battles of mandarinate (and, of course, stay out of their neighborhoods, they’ll be provided panem et circenses. Um, we speak Merican here. So, “they will be provided McDonald’s and Merican Idol.” So basically you support the Robert Heinlein model of citizenship (from the book “Starship Troopers”). I’ll admit that it does have a certain appeal and I’d love to see a politician try that as an epic troll. I can barely believe that the Democrats are going into a presidential election promoting gun control and Syrian immigration. Do they not listen to their pollsters at all? I don’t get it. The Clinton administration learned its gun control lesson the hard way, and gun control is even less popular now. And beyond the bleeding-heart liberals, the “let’s destroy white Christian America” sort, and the open borders types, there’s no real constituency in favor of Syrian refugees. And then there’s Hillary’s idiocy about “all sexual assault victims should be believed.” That has got to be in the top 10 of own-goal statements by American politicians. It’s as if they are trying to hand the election to Trump. It is like he is some mole created to destroy the Democratic Party. Gun control has always been a political loser and it is if anything a bigger loser issue now than it was 16 years ago when it was costing Al Gore the Presidency. Wasn’t Trump encouraged to run by Bill Clinton? I don’t know. But i fail to see how Trump running is going to undo the damage Obama has done to the Democratic party. Agreed, at the state level Obama really wrecked the party. Trump could help Hilary get the White House though and Dems running for senate could squeeze in just by virtue of the ticket – plus the possibility of appointing new Justices. However, I think the plan may be backfiring, he may have a real chance to beat her at this point. When my coworker from Hong Kong put up a Trump sign in her yard and a Trump sticker on her Prius, I knew something was amiss . . .. or afoot . . . . or weird . . . I wish he would destroy the gems in WA. We have a commie governor and even my city of Spokane is run by leftist traitors that have turned it into a sanctuary city. That could mean several things. It could mean Trump is a Democratic mole, intending to throw the election. But I don’t see an egomaniac like Trump losing the biggest election in the world as a favor to a golfing buddy. I think it’s very likely that Bill wants Hillary to lose. Some of the things he said in 2008 sure sounded like subtle sabotage. Why would he want to have her overshadow him? Plus, being the First Husband would put a crimp in his babe-chasing. And he’s got plenty of emotional reasons to want to take her down a peg. Bill knows the minute he’s back in the White House, 1) the party’s over and he can’t go chasing tail for a while, and 2) he’d end up being expected to run the country again because no one really likes his wife outside of a gaggle of bitter cat ladies. I can’t imagine Bill has gotten any off that broad he’s married to in many years. What better revenge than to screw up her chances of winning the election? Maybe the media just wanted a challenge. I can barely believe that the Democrats are going into a presidential election promoting gun control and Syrian immigration. It seems like electoral suicide. I’m curious to see how the Repubs fuck this golden opportunity up. They won’t. What they will actually do once in power is another question. But regardless of what happens in the Presidential election, the Democrats are doomed in every other election except in a few dark blue states. They won’t. You have faith in Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Paul Ryan? Which part of “regardless of what happens in the Presidential election, the Democrats are doomed in every other election except in a few dark blue states.” did you not understand? And yeah, I think love him or hate him Trump is likely to win the Presidency. I would have never believed it but every day it looks more and more likely to happen. I didn’t read your entire statement. My mistake. I think the leadership in the Republican party is capable of screwing anything up, even this gun control issue, which should be impossible to screw up. If the Democrats have anything to do with it, they’ll challenge the Republicans on abortion and gay rights and the R’s will promptly self-destruct. They’ve been known to fail to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory before. But sometimes they don’t. It was an article of religous faith around here that they would not take the Senate in 2014. The party line on Reason is that the Republicans will always lose any election no matter what. Since they do lose, that is sometimes right but not always That’s what i was saying, what with the double negative. The Republicans seem to be trying to lose, but the Democrats may well be trying harder, and might end up doing a better job of losing this time around. Lord knows both sides deserve to lose. But no matter who loses the election, it is never going to be the Libertarian Party who wins. A reality that has infuriated me to no end. Libertarian Moment!!!!111eleventyone!! Given that Rand Paul is the most Libertarian major party candidate, it speaks volumes about Reason that it has not really gotten behind him. Compare the number of Rand Paul articles compared to the massive onslaught of Trump articles over the last six months. Negative or not, Trump is getting sometimes multiple articles posted per day. I’m not sure if Rand gets one per week on average. If this is the big Libertarian publication, it doesn’t give libertarians much hope. Abandon hope, ye Libertarians who post here I think they give an appropriate level of coverage to a candidate who is only semi-libertarian who is polling around 2-3%. I Ihave full faith in Cruz. Why should anyone not ? We elected him here in Texas and he has done exactly what he said he was going to do in Washington if he was elected. It’s the first time in my life I’e ever seen that happen. He called out the Republican leadership by name on teh Senate floor and esxplained what kind of dirty tricks they were playing on the voters who sent them there. Check it out on you tube. He successfully argued a gun rights case before the SCOTUS. Google a few articles from different people about his time in the FTC. How could anyone expect more from a leader than that. He is as libertarian as anyone can be who stands any reasonable chance to actually get elected. The man could turn out to be one of the best Presidents in history based on his track record and if you will look into it past the click bait headlines you might just agree. He is both brilliant and principaled. Thanks, Mom! You mean principled. I remember another president who was considered brilliant, principled, and an outsider, and who was disliked by the Washington, DC establishment. It was always said that being considered an outsider severely hampered his efforts to get much of anything done. That was Jimmy Carter. Certainly, if the election is decided on gun rights, the Republicans will maintain control of the Senate, Those Senate seats up for grabs seem to be mostly in flyover country. Meanwhile, Republicans hold both houses in 31 state legislatures–which was already historically unusual. That number may be set to increase if gun control becomes the issue on which this election is decided. If a Republican actually won the White House, the stage might be set to get a Constitutional amendment ratified to balance the federal budget or something else useful–like limit the power of public employee unions. I hope they don’t squander that opportunity on Trump. Federal public employee unions are only allowed because of an executive order by JFK. They can be banned by another one. Too bad Reagan didn’t do it. I have no idea why he didn’t. It rhymes with Ronald Rump? Or better yet, do a coup at convention and acclaim Jeb, then wonder how you lost… “…do a coup at convention and acclaim Jeb, then wonder how you lost…” I think that is exactly what they have in mind. Whether they succeed or not remains to be seen. I think that would be suicide for the GOPe. The uproar would be incredible. It makes more sense for them to swallow hard and make nice with Trump. I would be forced to visit my rage upon them. Through strongly worded letters of course. No woodchoppers involved for the DoJ pricks being paid to read these comments. None whatsoever. “I’m curious to see how the Repubs fuck this golden opportunity up.” His name is Donald Trump. I think Trump beats Hillary in a head-to-head in November. I’m beginning to think that, in the environment we have this year, he is almost the perfect candidate to beat her like a rented mule. He will not adhere to the pieties and indulgences that the Clintons have coasted on forever. He has shown that he is perfectly willing to call her husband a degenerate who abuses women, and to call her age and health into question. As a candidate, what he says cannot be ignored by the media, so it will be out there. And once it gets out there, she can’t deal with it worth a damn, because she is a terrible candidate who cannot think on her feet or get most people to give her the benefit of the doubt. it will be EPIC. You mean YUGE? I was waiting to see if Trump would start spending his own money before I’d take him seriously. Then I saw this today: http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/…..or-rivals/ He’s now calling her age into question? I hadn’t heard that one. Someone should probably tell him that’s he’s older than Clinton. Yes Adam, but he had that doctor’s note saying how awesome his health was. Hillary has no such note. I never thought Hillary was a shoe-in as many claimed, but yes, Trump beats her. Trump puts a number of “safe” blue states in play, including New York. Plus there’s the rarity of any party holding the White House for three terms in a row. It’s not like there is a groundswell of swing voters wanting four more years like the last eight. Can you imagine how pissed she would be – losing to Rubio is one thing, but losing to Trump is like karma and schadenfreude and Monica’s revenge, all rolled into a neat little package. 🙂 He would crush her. He knows how to play the media and so far has gotten away with saying shit that would end the career of any other GOP candidate ten times over. He also isn’t playing into that ‘nice guy’ crap that cost McCain and Romney their elections. They both ran bad campaigns. Trump is running a good one. The DNC has never encountered someone like Trump as an opponent. Their consultant weasels have no idea how to stop him. Just like all the consultant weasels for the other GOP candidates have no idea how to stop them. One word: Trump. “And then there’s Hillary’s idiocy about “all sexual assault victims should be believed.”” Well, not all. Only the one’s who weren’t assaulted by her husband should be believed. She said “victims” not “evil agents of vast right-wing conspiracy”, man. Hillary was talking about “normals”, not obvious political actions by shadowy conservative groups. They wrote an $850K check to one of those whom she didn’t believe to keep from going to court against her. That’s a larger settlement than a nusisance case usually seems to get. Maybe she wavered a little on that one. Which one was that? “And then there’s Hillary’s idiocy about “all sexual assault victims should be believed.” My wife is convinced that The Hildebeast has brain damage. Someone come up with a better explanation, I dare you. She’s a lefty. Lefties emote. They don’t resort to logic, reason, or concern themselves with consistency or principles. They emote. She sees the opportunity to resonate with women – she emotes. Somebody goes after her husband, she emotes and attacks them. And it’s not even actual emotion, because that would require some sort of inner self to react, rather than spaghetti-code narrative programming. Instead, it’s like those scenes in Star Trek when Data was trying to imitate some human reaction and it just came off as fake and really uncomfortable. Hillary isn’t a real prog. She is a complete sociopath that uses progressivism to attain power. As is her husband. She has no real emotions, other than maybe rage when she does;t get what she feels she is owed. Which is everything. This is why she comes off as being so insincere. Because she is. She has zero conviction. If she could be empress for all eternity tomorrow by turning evangelical republican, she would do it. Someone recently said (Ed Klein I think) that there are three major political parties i the US. Republicans, democrats, and Clintons. As there are not enough Clinton votes to get elected, they use the democrats as a vehicle for their power. I believe that. “And then there’s Hillary’s idiocy about ‘all sexual assault victims should be believed.'” Except for that one case when she, as a lawyer, got a rapist she claims she knew was guilty found innocent by repeatedly lying and attacking the character of the teenage victim. In that case the victim should not be believed, and the story, when told by Hillary to reporters, is hilarious and worthy of eliciting laughs from Hillary as she recounts that time she got a rapist found innocent. That is going to show up in an independent ad. The girl has since grown up, and is still ticked off that Hillary slimed her in court. I really hope she stands up, whoever she is, and gets this add crowdsourced. I would send money for that. I’d buy that for a dollar! Obama hates the Clintons. It’s the only thing he and I agree on. To be fair, he had on on mic moment where when asked what he thought about Kanye West grabbing the microphone from Taylor Swift. He called him a jackass. I agree with Obama on that too. Obama also hates Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. So, I think that’s TWO things. (don’t tell me you’re a fan of Medusa-the-Snake-haired Congresswoman; I know better). I can barely believe that the Democrats are going into a presidential election promoting gun control and Syrian immigration. Because they know it won’t matter. The Dems have a very big advantage in the Electoral College, and an even bigger advantage from the MSM. I am starting to believe that the Dems have a long term lock on the Presidency, while they will continue to lose every other office. This is actually good news, as a permanent Republican Congress might decide it’s time to limit the power of a permanent Democrat Executive. But remember kids, if you tax abortion services gun sellers for the purposes of funding safety studies, it’s perfectly reasonable because everyone knows that a tax is merely there to raise revenue. There exists not one single reason to trust this lying POS to do other than lie. It’s breathing for him. “”tomorrow we should do more, and do more the day after that.” Libertarians by contrast think Incrementalism is ‘selling out’. The overtone window has moved steadily to the authoritarian left for decades. There is no incrementalism possible to libertarians unless progressives move the window for them. Libertarians are fellow travelers to progressives on social issues (or, used to be until progressives became fascists). Never does government get smaller – never. Ugh. ‘overton’ “The game of ratcheting gun laws more and more has no foreseeable end” Well, it ends for Obama when he is no longer in office, and it’s especially a good thing in Obama’s eyes that the damage he’s done to our legal gun rights probably won’t be undone. It seems unlikely that the next President will reverse an executive order in his or her first term when doing so will open up that President to criticism the first time someone with a mental health issue kills someone else with a legally acquired gun. The permanence of the damage Obama has done to our rights makes him the worst President we’ve had since before FDR. certainly can’t think of a better way to rank Presidents than the extent to which they’ve damaged our Constitutional rights. It seems unlikely that the next President will reverse an executive order in his or her first term when doing so will open up that President to criticism Sadly, this is true. But these particular executive actions aren’t executive orders, so they can be withdrawn quietly. Yeah, maybe the Democrats won’t bring it up? I hope you’re right. Lord knows president Trump will be deeply worried about criticism. It terrifies me that this thought came to my mind, too. Once president, his attitude may well be “I’m president. Don’t like it? Fuck you.”. I could do without the weeping. I thought we were done with that when the orange man left. Maybe I missed it but I have yet to hear anyone point out his deadpan, tearless delivery of his addresses after the paris attack and the SB attack or his joking around before his address after the Fort Hood attack. I don’t remember his response to Fort Hood, but there has been some chatter about how he’s just going through the motions on these statements now. Of course he is, but it is telling to me that he couldn’t be bothered to even do that before. He can conjure up tears when it helps him politically, but not for actual murder victims. It was reported that he referred to himself 76 times in his speech today. It’s about him, not you and I or the Country. I just hate for him that 6 soldiers were killed in December and intruded on his vacay. So, in the same speech he said ‘tomorrow we should do more’ and ‘this is not a slippery slope’. I see. Mr. President – Fuck you. No. *I leave aside the fact that these unconstitutional new ‘laws’ written and signed by the president actually change nothing. They will not affect the sale or transfer of guns one whit. The answer is still a resounding NO. I remember Billy Clinton insisting that whatever gun control he was arguing for wasn’t a camel’s nose under the tent. There’s no need to invent new lies, I guess, when the old ones are good. I like this guy better; “I don’t care about crime, I just want to get the guns.” – Sen Howard Metzenbaum. The best politician on guns, though? R. Budd Dwyer, hands down. Well now I’ll have that crappy Filter song in my head all day. I’d say, “Thanks, dick”, but it’s quite a bit better than the Daniel Tiger theme song that’s been in my head for weeks. How the hell does someone that honest get elected in America?? Obama doesn’t care about mass murders, he cares about the monopoly on violence. He thinks it’s important that the State be the only entity able to do violence. And from what I can tell, a significant subset of progressive fucks are smart enough to understand this. The whole “gun safety” nonsense feels remarkably cynical to me. Obama cares about inflicting his personal will on the American people. He feels he’s justified in doing that for a number of reasons, including righting historical wrongs, but in addition to that, he also despises the American people for being racist and capitalist. He hates the American people for who we are, what we do, what we’ve done in the past, and what we want, and he sees himself as justified in inflicting his will on us because he hates us. In his mind, if you were a decent person, you’d hate yourself, too. I hate Warty. Does that count? SHUT UP X I HATE YOU SHUT UP THEN I MUST BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT IN LIFE “Don’t it make your brown eyes blue?” reporter asked Obama. “Well, yes, yes it does. Particularly when I dice the yellow onions”, Obama replied. But he cried, man. Obama cried. Doesn’t that count for SOMETHING? Yeah, Obama crying makes people who never wanted an AR-15 before queue up to buy them. SWHC was up 11% today. Funny how that works (grin). It’s almost as if Obama is a double agent or somethin’ . . . Honestly, I can’t think of a better way to register disgust with Obama’s order than for people to go out and buy an AR-15 tomorrow. You don’t even have to buy the whole thing. I think you can just get the lower for less than a couple hundred bucks. Obama has been the best thing for gun sales ever. When the president orders a drone strike that kills a bunch of kids in Sandistan, does he cry for them? Or does he only cry for kids who die from something he can use for political points? No, that was Bush’s fault. And let’s never forget that Barack Obama has killed more children than Adam Lanza. Did you see SWHC today? Up 12%. Great minds think alike, Juice. No one’s done more to put guns in the hands of people who never had them before than Barack Obama. Colt and S&W should start putting him and his speeches in their advertising–without comment. Just a picture of Obama, the text of his speeches, and their name brand. *cue scary music* “Buy a gun today… while you still can.” Not to mention all of the new NRA members . . . I would argue that joining the NRA is probably the worst way to fight for gun rights. Wayne LaPierre is basically the NRA version of John Boehner…he’s an abrasive asshole who comes off to those who don’t pay attention like he’s pro-gun rights, but the NRA under his leadership hasn’t put up much of a fight for gun rights anywhere. His method of “fighting” is “issue a sternly worded press release and do nothing further”. The money that’s given to the NRA via membership dues doesn’t even go towards their political outreach. Yes, but it drives Obama bat-shit crazy, so I’m signing you up. I posted before reading this post. =D Well here is teh thing. You buy NRA memberships for your gun grabbing progressive friends. =) I know at least three dozen people personally that joined. Never thought most of them would. A few of them don’t even own guns. Next model change, I suggest they name it “Barry”. (yes, I once worked in the auto industry). Toyota Camry and S&W Barry. I dislike Mr. Obama as much as most here. But, I think it helps to remember, he’s essentially just a front man. The modern left has essentially been conquered by the authoritarian progressives. He’s not spouting this bullshit to appeal to the country as a whole. He’s trying to appeal to what is the major base within the Democratic party. This is why I tend to urge libertarians to look to work with the right (at least where we can without selling out on principle). The left is pretty much captive to the authoritarians. I’ve never met a Lefty who doesn’t believe in Big Government. Not even on “social issues”. However, the Right can at least be guilted about their flirtation with FDR. (And don’t argue with me about this, Matt and Nick. You should have learned after your fiasco with Jared Polis). I was always skeptical of Polis, but even by my low expectations he really turned out to be a disappointment. Whatsamatta – you don’t like that on-line school Polis made you enroll in (grin). Next time, remember – No Means No. Nah, my online schooling has been pretty good…probably because Polis had no hand in any of it. 🙂 He’ll get to yours later, Cupcake . . . 🙂 My school has a popular enough football team that he wouldn’t dare mess with them. 🙂 Next time, remember – No Means No. or “Okay” means no. Or “Geez, he looked so much hotter last night…” means no. Or “Ohmigod, my boyfriend wants to get back together with me…” means no. Or “he gave me crabs”, means no 🙂 Yeah, I understand where a lot of (especially older) libertarians might not tend to get it. For a long time, conservatives were happy to use state power to push traditional morality and social standards. Both progressives and libertarians were opposed. But, libertarians made the mistake of assuming that the progressives were like them in that they didn’t believe the government should be pushing morality or social standards. They weren’t. They were happy to have the government pushing these things. They just wanted their own morality and social standards to be the things being pushed. Yup. The problem was never really about morality or social standards, no matter who was in charge…it was always about the willingness to use force to push them on other people. And that’s been a problem with both parties. And that’s been a problem with both parties. True. But, I tend to think the facts on the ground have changed such that now, it’s hard to argue that it’s still six of one, half a dozen of the other. Regardless of what some conservatives might want, the government isn’t going to be getting back into the “push traditional values and social standards” business. It is in and is only getting deeper in the “push progressive values and social standards” business. And the right seems to be picking up on the fact that they’ve lost the Kulturkampf. A lot of conservatives are no longer really even giving it all that much lip service. The proggies, on the other hand, only seem to be ramping up their authority boners. I disagree. Look at the current slate of GOP candidates…every one of them polling in double digits is a social conservative running on some variation of “traditional values”. So are many of the Republicans who won in the states in 2014. So are many of the “Tea Party movement” Republicans (Thomas Massie, a favorite with libertarians, was strongly in favor of Kim Davis’ abuses of power). As much as I hate it and wish that the GOP would stay out of social issues, that doesn’t seem to be the way they’re going. Well let me put it this way Who do I have to worry about more attacking me for watching porn, the right or the left? Who’s giving us speech codes, the right or the left? Which side is getting people fired from their jobs for saying the wrong thing, the right or the left? Which side is demanding other people sell them stuff when they don’t want to, the right or the left? Which side is pushing to get rid of due process when there is an accusation of rape, the right or the left? No, the GOP isn’t staying out of social issues, but when it comes time to pull out the old coercion bat, the GOP isn’t in the left’s league anymore. Alberto Gonzales, Bush’s AG, was actually quite active in cracking down on legal porn. Not child porn or some weird fetish stuff…he sicced the DOJ on legal porn. The left and the right have forced us to give money to corporations (insurance and car companies under Obama, insurance and banks under Bush). Neither has been a fan of due process when it gets in the way of what they want. I see both as threats. That said, I did agree with Ted Cruz that literally every Republican candidate (including Trump) is more competent to be President than Hillary. I’ve found that the contemporary definition for the term “common sense”, as employed in political debates, is basically a euphemism for “I’m too lazy or stupid to do any research so I’m going to make a fallacious appeal to perceived popularity”. So basically whenever you hear someone make an appeal to “common sense” in a debate, the proper response is call them out on their ignorance and then to treat them like a fucking idiot. It won’t win them over, but then they’re not really interested in hearing facts or logic anyway and the angrier you make them, the more likely they are to actually do some research just to try and discredit you. Yeah, “common sense policies on XYZ” are just a euphemism for “obviously I am right and only an evil moron could disagree with this.” It is purest noise. The funniest thing is that “common sense” apparently changes all the time. In 1967 apparently nobody had any common sense because nobody was suggesting things like magazine size limits. Hell, in Britain up until 1964, there was no legal bar to a convicted felon owning a gun. I guess nobody had any common sense then. And in ten years, “common sense” will tell us something else that nobody is proposing now. If it really was common sense, then there would be little to no discussion of changing or amending the laws or the Constitution, and no need for politicians to stump on common sense. After all, it’s common sense. The reason gun rights advocates don’t believe these clowns is because they advocate policies that don’t make sense about a subject of which they’re totally ignorant without even knowing the status quo. And then they call it “common sense”. Common sense is a basic ability to perceive, understand, and judge things, which is shared by (“common to”) nearly all people and can reasonably be expected of nearly all people without any need for debate. (Wikipedia) The existence of common sense itself is something that only an arrogant person incapable of recognizing their own ignorance would accept. The purpose of all gun controls is reducing freedom, not crime. Otherwise liberals would admit that getting rid of gun-free zones is a good idea. But every little change shifts the Overton Window leftward a bit, bringing closer the day when they can finally prohibit ordinary citizens from owning guns and even confiscate them. (They’re already just one SCOTUS Injustice from eliminating our Second Amendment rights.) +1 Overton Window https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window Well that speech was cringe worthy. What an ass. Enough Impeach this charlatan. He’s The First Black President, didn’t you notice? He’s impossible to impeach without histrionics about “racism!!1” being the real motive. I miss Bill Clinton: he made himself feel good by getting blow jobs from White House interns; sure, it was sleazy, but it was pretty harmless in the grand scheme of things. Obama, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to be able to get his jollies other than by passing useless progressive legislation and expanding the power of the executive branch. You are aware that Bill Clinton also supports gun control and socialized medicine? HillaryCare? Assault Gun Bans? Paul Begala? Jim Carville? Again Reason is being very pussy-footed with regards to this. Obama and the rest of the Dems want more gun control and any ratchet will help. If they could operate by executive action then they don’t need to worry about Congressional majorities or popularity since they supposedly have the White House “locked” for the time being. This is true, Obumbles is a lying sack of shit. Though he won’t admit it he and his acolytes won’t admit it there end is to take people’s right to defend themselves. Hildog is even worse than chocolate nixon. It’s not even close, they lie, their purpose is to get our guns. And the choco nixon is doubling down. Most staist asshole ever to hold the presidency…no brainer. Barry and we thought Booosh was bad. Barry makes BOOOsh look like an amateur I wonder what his position on “common sense bomb control” was when his pal Ayers was setting them. I’m sure that also Bush’s fault, somehow. Obama was still a little kid when Ayers was setting off bombs, so he probably didn’t have much of a position on the subject. Common sense,… How about guns are used in self-defense 1.9 million times per year. Contrast that with the 8000 murders committed with guns, 230 times as many violent crimes prevented. Not to mention the common sense that some of those 8000 are also legitimate self-defense. Reducing private ownership of guns WILL increase the number of innocent victims, common sense. But that doesn’t make headlines and doesn’t make Mr. Unprecedented more famous. Fuck the hell out of Obama and the circus act he rode in on. Exactly…this guy is a doofus…that he has been the face of FedGov for 8 years is fucking embarassment. If we make murder double-illegal then there will only be 50% as many murders. Can I have that Nobel Peace Prize cash now? double SECRET illegal! Forget guns! I’m worried sick about golf! I don’t know anything about it, but i don’t see why you should be able to carry around 14 clubs in public! CLUBS for god’s sake! And i’m told you can buy them anywhere w/o a background check! COMPLETELY UNREGULATED! & why would you need a huge pocket on the bag full of balls? 2 or 3 should be plenty (in case you lose one). & i’m told alcohol is often involved as well. This looks like a tragedy in the making! ‘Just a matter of time. & they take these clubs to ranges. & to courses, both of which use an immense amount of land & precious water resources to maintain. & when they’re done, they’re out on public streets, all liquored up, with all those CLUBS that are allowed to be transported in an unsecured bag with all those balls in the same bag. Blatantly irresponsible! We need to close the loopholes! Limit the clubs to 1 driver, 1 iron, & 1 putter at a minimum. They can only buy 3 balls/month w/their fingerprint. We just need some common sense regulations! Hi Nice Nice reply Nice 2 dddd Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised that this was all Obama had in his arsenal (pun intended). I think this leaves him with an empty chamber for the rest of his term (pun intended). Yeah, it will create government bloat without solving a damn thing; yeah, the mental health aspects are a little worrying. But what I really picked up from this is that the staffers he has dedicated to finding any possible way to get around that pesky Constitution weren’t able to find a single thing he could do that could actually restrict gun ownership on anyone who wasn’t already disallowed from owning a gun. Yes. Obama, in his zeal has prematurely shot his wad on what was supposed to be a dry run. And now will be left with something of a mess on his hands. Puns intended, and many thanks to that Funke I’ve been hearing about. Google pay 97$ per hour my last pay check was $8500 working 1o hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for months now and he works about 22 hours a week. I cant believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is wha- I do…… ?????? http://www.buzznews99.com since a person is pretty directly responsible for mass shootings it seems like they should be more controllable than a hurricane or earthquake or something, but that’s how we should think of them Please log in to post comments Liz Wolfe

 From the February 2016 issue ""There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America,"" President Barack Obama proclaimed after the October mass shooting that killed 10 at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. ""So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work—or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns—is not borne out by the evidence."" In this single brief statement, Obama tidily listed the major questions bedeviling social science research about guns—while also embodying the biggest problem with the way we process and apply that research. The president's ironclad confidence in the conclusiveness of the science, and therefore the desirability of ""common-sense gun safety laws,"" is echoed widely with every new mass shooting, from academia to the popular press to that guy you knew from high school on Facebook. In April 2015, the Harvard gun-violence researcher David Hemenway took to the pages of the Los Angeles Times to declare in a headline: ""There's scientific consensus on guns—and the NRA won't like it."" Hemenway insisted that researchers have definitively established ""that a gun in the home makes it a more dangerous place to be…that guns are not used in self-defense far more often than they are used in crime…and that the change to more permissive gun carrying laws has not reduced crime rates."" He concludes: ""There is consensus that strong gun laws reduce homicide."" But the science is a lot less certain than that. What we really know about the costs and benefits of private gun ownership and the efficacy of gun laws is far more fragile than what Hemenway and the president would have us believe. More guns do not necessarily mean more homicides. More gun laws do not necessarily mean less gun crime. Finding good science is hard enough; finding good social science on a topic so fraught with politics is nigh impossible. The facts then become even more muddled as the conclusions of those less-than-ironclad academic studies cycle through the press and social media in a massive game of telephone. Despite the confident assertions of the gun controllers and decades of research, we still know astonishingly little about how guns actually function in society and almost nothing at all about whether gun control policies actually work as promised. Do More Guns Mean More Homicides? ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history,"" New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote on August 26, 2015, just after the grisly on-air murder of two television journalists in Virginia. It's a startling fact, and true. But do the number of guns in circulation correlate with the number of gun deaths? Start by looking at the category of gun death that propels all gun policy discussion: homicides. (Gun suicides, discussed further below, are a separate matter whose frequent conflation with gun crime introduces much confusion into the debate.) In 1994 Americans owned around 192 million guns, according to the U.S. Justice Department's National Institute of Justice. Today, that figure is somewhere between 245 and 328 million, though as Philip J. Cook and Kristin A. Goss in their thorough 2014 book The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know (Oxford University Press) wisely concluded, ""the bottom line is that no one knows how many firearms are in private hands in the United States."" Still, we have reason to believe gun prevalence likely surpassed the one-gun-per-adult mark early in President Barack Obama's first term, according to a 2012 Congressional Research Service report that relied on sales and import data. Yet during that same period, per-capita gun murders have been cut almost in half. One could argue that the relevant number is not the number of guns, but the number of people with access to guns. That figure is also ambiguous. A Gallup poll in 2014 found 42 percent of households claiming to own a gun, which Gallup reports is ""similar to the average reported to Gallup over the past decade."" But those looking for a smaller number, to downplay the significance of guns in American life, can rely on the door-to-door General Social Survey, which reported in 2014 that only 31 percent of households have guns, down 11 percentage points from 1993's 42 percent. There is no singular theory to explain that discrepancy or to be sure which one is closer to correct—though some doubt, especially as gun ownership continues to be so politically contentious, that people always reliably report the weapons they own to a stranger literally at their door. The gun murder rate in 1993 was 7.0 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. (Those reports rely on death certificate reporting, and they tend to show higher numbers than the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program, though both trend the same.) In 2000 the gun murder rate per 100,000 was 3.8. By 2013, the rate was even lower, at 3.5, though there was a slight upswing in the mid-00s. This simple point—that America is awash with more guns than ever before, yet we are killing each other with guns at a far lower rate than when we had far fewer guns—undermines the narrative that there is a straightforward, causal relationship between increased gun prevalence and gun homicide. Even if you fall back on the conclusion that it's just a small number of owners stockpiling more and more guns, it's hard to escape noticing that even these hoarders seem to be harming fewer and fewer people with their weapons, casting doubt on the proposition that gun ownership is a political crisis demanding action. In the face of these trend lines—way more guns, way fewer gun murders—how can politicians such as Obama and Hillary Clinton so successfully capitalize on the panic that follows each high profile shooting? Partly because Americans haven't caught on to the crime drop. A 2013 Pew Research Poll found 56 percent of respondents thought that gun crime had gone up over the past 20 years, and only 12 percent were aware it had declined. Do Gun Laws Stop Gun Crimes? The same week Kristof's column came out, National Journal attracted major media attention with a showy piece of research and analysis headlined ""The States With The Most Gun Laws See The Fewest Gun-Related Deaths."" The subhead lamented: ""But there's still little appetite to talk about more restrictions."" Critics quickly noted that the Journal's Libby Isenstein had included suicides among ""gun-related deaths"" and suicide-irrelevant policies such as stand-your-ground laws among its tally of ""gun laws."" That meant that high-suicide, low-homicide states such as Wyoming, Alaska, and Idaho were taken to task for their liberal carry-permit policies. Worse, several of the states with what the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence considers terribly lax gun laws were dropped from Isenstein's data set because their murder rates were too low! Another of National Journal's mistakes is a common one in gun science: The paper didn't look at gun statistics in the context of overall violent crime, a much more relevant measure to the policy debate. After all, if less gun crime doesn't mean less crime overall—if criminals simply substitute other weapons or means when guns are less available—the benefit of the relevant gun laws is thrown into doubt. When Thomas Firey of the Cato Institute ran regressions of Isenstein's study with slightly different specifications and considering all violent crime, each of her effects either disappeared or reversed. Another recent well-publicized study trying to assert a positive connection between gun laws and public safety was a 2013 JAMA Internal Medicine article by the Harvard pediatrics professor Eric W. Fleegler and his colleagues, called ""Firearm Legislation and Firearm-Related Fatalities in the United States."" It offered a mostly static comparison of the toughness of state gun laws (as rated by the gun control lobbyists at the Brady Center) with gun deaths from 2007 to 2010. ""States with strictest firearm laws have lowest rates of gun deaths,"" a Boston Globe headline then announced. But once again, if you take the simple, obvious step of separating out suicides from murders, the correlations that buttress the supposed causations disappear. As John Hinderaker headlined his reaction at the Power Line blog, ""New Study Finds Firearm Laws Do Nothing to Prevent Homicides."" Among other anomalies in Fleegler's research, Hinderaker pointed out that it didn't include Washington, D.C., with its strict gun laws and frequent homicides. If just one weak-gun-law state, Louisiana, were taken out of the equation, ""the remaining nine lowest-regulation states have an average gun homicide rate of 2.8 per 100,000, which is 12.5% less than the average of the ten states with the strictest gun control laws,"" he found. Public health researcher Garen Wintemute, who advocates stronger gun laws, assessed the spate of gun-law studies during an October interview with Slate and found it wanting: ""There have been studies that have essentially toted up the number of laws various states have on the books and examined the association between the number of laws and rates of firearm death,"" said Wintemute, who is a medical doctor and researcher at the University of California, Davis. ""That's really bad science, and it shouldn't inform policymaking."" Wintemute thinks the factor such studies don't adequately consider is the number of people in a state who have guns to begin with, which is generally not known or even well-estimated on levels smaller than national, though researchers have used proxies from subscribers to certain gun-related magazines and percentages of suicides committed with guns to make educated guesses. ""Perhaps these laws decrease mortality by decreasing firearm ownership, in which case firearm ownership mediates the association,"" Wintemute wrote in a 2013 JAMA Internal Medicine paper. ""But perhaps, and more plausibly, these laws are more readily enacted in states where the prevalence of firearm ownership is low—there will be less opposition to them—and firearm ownership confounds the association."" What About Suicides? Removing suicides from ""gun deaths"" is a basic step for assessing whether a gun regulation is producing its proposed effect, which in most cases is to reduce the number and severity of gun murders. But what do gun suicide rates tell us on their own? Chiefly, that a gun is a very efficient means of killing yourself. According to the CDC's National Vital Statistics System, 21,175 Americans committed suicide with firearms in 2013, more than twice as many as used the next most popular suicide method, suffocation. There were nearly twice as many gun suicides that year as gun homicides. Gun owners are more than three times as likely to commit suicide as non-gun owners, according to a 2014 Annals of Internal Medicine meta-analysis by Andrew Anglemyer and his colleagues. They looked at 14 previous observational studies regarding suicide from 1988 to 2005, statistically re-analyzing them all together. They found that the studies (with one exception) indicated that the people who committed suicide (whether with a gun or not) were more likely, usually far more likely, to own guns than the control group of people with similar characteristics who did not kill themselves. This does not, however, allow us to conclude that the gun's presence caused the suicide, since it's always possible that those more likely to be suicidal are more likely to want to own guns. A 2002 study by Mark Duggan, now an economist at Stanford University, seems to endorse that conclusion, writing that ""much of the positive relationship between firearms ownership and suicide is driven by selection—individuals with above average suicidal tendencies are more likely to own a gun and to live in areas with relatively many gun owners."" The U.S. currently ranks 47th in total suicide rates among nations according to World Health Organization (WHO) calculations, and 11th among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nations. But our firearm suicide rates are among the highest in the world, likely behind only Uruguay. Nations with far tougher gun laws and far lower known prevalences of gun ownership, such as Japan, India, and Korea, have far higher overall suicide rates. This suggests that the percentage of firearms in America leads us to have more firearm suicides, but not necessarily more suicides overall. Of the 56 nations for which the WHO felt it had accurate reported method data, hanging remained the most popular means of death, accounting for over 40 percent of suicides in 35 of them. At least one study—""Small Arms Mortality: Access to Firearms and Lethal Violence,"" by Mark Konty and Brian Schaefer, published in 2012 in the journal Sociological Spectrum—used ""nation-level…data from the Small Arms Survey and the World Health Organization's measures of mortality"" to ""examine whether rates of small arm ownership have a positive effect on rates of homicide and suicide."" Their conclusion: ""Contrary to the opportunity model, the accessibility of firearms does not produce more homicide or suicide when other known factors are controlled for."" Still, evidence from the Anglemyer meta-analysis suggests that policies like waiting periods, trigger locks, or other ""safe storage"" requirements might prevent some suicides by inserting at least a little extra time to think things through. Is Having a Gun in the Home Inherently Deadly? The idea that keeping a gun in the home puts owners and their families at elevated risk first rose to prominence in a 1993 New England Journal of Medicine article by Arthur Kellermann and his colleagues. ""Although firearms are often kept in homes for personal protection,"" they concluded, ""this study shows that the practice is counterproductive."" The study has many flaws. In addition to the predictable failure to establish causality, there's a more glaring irregularity: Slightly less than half of the murders Kellermann studied were actually committed with a gun (substantially less than the national average in 1993 of around 71 percent). And even in those cases he failed to establish that the gun owners were killed with their own guns. If even a small percentage of them weren't, given that more than half of the murders were not committed with guns, the causal relevance of the harmed being gun owners is far less clear. (The study found that even more dangerous risks than having a gun at home included living alone, using drugs, or being a renter.) A 2013 literature review in the journal Aggression and Violent Behavior, written by the University of Utrecht psychologist Wolfgang Stroebe, starts with Kellermann but rejects the idea that firearm possession is ""a primary cause of either suicide or homicide."" However, he writes, ""since guns are more effective means for [actually killing someone] than poison or other weapons, the rate of firearm possession can be expected to be positively related to overall rates of suicide and homicide."" But even then we can't be sure of causality, since guns might be the choice of people with more serious lethal intent, against themselves or others, to begin with. Stroebe notes that the two major post-Kellermann studies most often used to demonstrate an association between gun ownership and risk of homicide shared one of Kellermann's fatal flaws: They offer no information about whether the gun used to kill the gun owners was their own. And despite Kellermann's finding that living alone was very risky, one of the follow-ups, a 2004 study by Linda Dahlberg and colleagues, found that it was only those with roommates who faced a higher risk of a specifically gun-related homicide. Are Guns a Public Health Hazard? Public health—long associated with the prevention of communicable diseases—got into the gun social science game with a vengeance in the 1990s. These scholars commonly viewed weapons as nothing more than vectors for harm; leading lights, such as a professor at Harvard's School of Public Health, could happily declare: ""I hate guns and cannot imagine why anybody would want to own one. If I had my way, guns for sport would be registered, and all other guns would be banned."" The CDC earlier in 1987 published a study openly recommending confiscating guns in the name of public health. Public health scholars have continued to research from a place of hostility to firearms. An October 2015 special issue of the journal Preventive Medicine dedicated to guns began with an editorial that praised the role the public health movement played in spreading vaccines and reducing tobacco use, then cut to the quick: ""It is the editorial position of this journal that there is one overtly visible and low-hanging fruit left in the tree, one that has surprisingly eluded concerted action from public health: gun violence prevention."" Alas, there is an obstacle: the ""peculiar proclivity that much of the American population has with firearms."" That proclivity is indeed vast. In addition to those owning guns for reasons of self-defense, there is the massive recreational component. A 2011 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service survey found that ""13.7 million people, 6% of the U.S. population 16 years old and older, went hunting."" The National Sporting Goods Association says there were at least 20 million recreational target shooters in the U.S. as of 2014. Less quantifiable, but still quite real, are the sense of self-fulfillment and identity that guns and gun culture bring to Americans, the same way any other recreation from surfing to sailing to car culture does. Attempts to scientifically demonstrate the ""social costs"" of guns—for example, a 2006 Journal of Public Economics paper called ""The Social Costs of Gun Ownership,"" by Duke's Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig (then of Georgetown)—typically don't rigorously address these benefits. While most of the articles in the Preventive Medicine issue were standard anti-gun material, one piece perhaps inadvertently undermined a popular argument for expanding background checks. ""Sources of Guns to Dangerous People: What We Learn By Asking Them,"" by Philip Cook and colleagues, surveyed a set of jailed criminals in Cook County, Illinois. It found that they ""obtain most of their guns from their social network of personal connections. Rarely is the proximate source either direct purchase from a gun store, or theft."" So the go-to remedy for gun control advocates seeking to limit homicides might not have much impact on actual gun criminals. How Often Are Guns Used Defensively? One of the most powerful narratives gun advocates have on their side is the image of a woman pulling a handgun out of her clutch to prevent a rape, or a man cocking a shotgun at a burglar to defend his family. Many social scientists who research this issue of ""defensive gun use"" (DGUs) say such scenarios are vanishingly rare, arguing that owning a gun is more likely to lead to harm for the owner than be his or her savior in a pinch. There are no even halfway thorough documentations of every such event in America. They are not all going to end up reported in the media or to the police. The FBI and the CDC will have no reason to record or learn about the vast majority of times a crime was prevented by the potential victim being armed. So our best estimates come from surveys. The survey work most famous for establishing a large number of DGUs—as many as 2.5 million a year—was conducted in 1993 by the Florida State University criminologists Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. Kleck says they found 222 bonafide DGUs directly via a randomized anonymous nationwide telephone survey of around 5,000 people. The defender had to ""state a specific crime they thought was being committed"" and to have actually made use of the weapon, even if just threateningly or by ""verbally referring to the gun."" Kleck insists the surveyors were scrupulous about eliminating any responses that seemed sketchy or questionable or didn't hold up under scrutiny. Extrapolating from their results, Kleck and Gertz concluded that 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs happened in the U.S. each year. In a 2001 edition of his book Armed, Kleck wrote that ""there are now at least nineteen professional surveys, seventeen of them national in scope, that indicate huge numbers of defensive gun uses in the U.S."" The one that most closely matched Kleck's methods, though the sample size was only half and the surveyors were not experienced with crime surveys, was 1994's National Survey of the Private Ownership of Firearms. It was sponsored by the U.S. Justice Department and found even more, when explicitly limiting them to ones that met the same criteria as Kleck's study—4.7 million (though the research write-up contains some details that may make you wonder about the accuracy of the reports, including one woman who reported 52 separate DGUs in a year). The major outlier in the other direction, nearly always relied on for those downplaying the defensive benefits of guns, is the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), a nationally representative telephone survey, which tends to find less than 70,000 DGUs per year. In the October 2015 special issue on ""gun violence prevention,"" Preventive Medicine featured the latest and most thorough attempt to treat the NCVS as the gold standard for measuring defensive gun usage. The study, by Harvard's Hemenway and Sara J. Solnick of the University of Vermont, broke down the characteristics of the small number of DGUs recorded by the NCVS from 2007 to 2011. The authors found, among other things, that ""Of the 127 incidents in which victims used a gun in self-defense, they were injured after they used a gun in 4.1% of the incidents. Running away and calling the police were associated with a reduced likelihood of injury after taking action; self-defense gun use was not."" That sounds not so great, but Hemenway went on to explain that ""attacking or threatening the perpetrator with a gun had no significant effect on the likelihood of the victim being injured after taking self-protective action,"" since slightly more people who tried non-firearm means of defending themselves were injured. Thus, for those who place value on self-defense and resistance over running, the use of a weapon doesn't seem too bad comparatively; Hemenway found that 55.9 percent of victims who took any kind of protective action lost property, but only 38.5 percent of people who used a gun in self-defense did. Kleck thinks the National Crime Victimization Survey disagrees so much with his own survey because NCVS researchers aren't looking for DGUs, or even asking about them in so many words. The survey merely asks those who said ""yes"" to having been a crime victim whether they ""did or tried to do"" something about it. (You might not consider yourself a ""victim"" of a crime you have successfully prevented.) Kleck surmises that people might be reluctant to admit to possibly criminal action on their own part (especially since the vast majority of crime victimizations occurred outside the home, where the legality of gun possession might be questionable) to a government surveyor after they've given their name and address. And as he argued in a Politico article in February 2015, experienced surveyors in criminology are sure that ""survey respondents underreport (1) crime victimization experiences, (2) gun ownership and (3) their own illegal behavior."" The social science quest for the One True DGU Number is interesting but ultimately irrelevant to those living out those specific stories, who would doubtless be perplexed to hear they shouldn't have the capacity to defend themselves with a gun because an insufficiently impressive number of other citizens had done the same. Even if the facts gleaned from gun social science were unfailingly accurate, that wouldn't make such policy decisions purely scientific. Could More Guns Mean Less Crime? The most well-known proponent of the idea that widespread private gun ownership might reduce the rates of violent crime is John Lott, a law and economics professor who has held positions at Yale, UCLA, and the University of Chicago, and who now works as an independent scholar with an organization he runs called the Crime Prevention Research Center. In 1998 Lott published the controversial book More Guns, Less Crime (University of Chicago Press), which was updated with a third edition in 2010. Lott's main argument is that pro-gun policies, such as shall-issue right-to-carry (RTC) laws, tend to lower most crime rates against person and property. Violent crime has been going down in America in the era when right to carry has spread, but social science is more complicated than simply pointing to two quantities moving in opposite directions. The most obvious and important fact in modern criminology—the huge decline in crime rates that started a quarter century ago—still lacks anything approaching a universally agreed-upon set of explanations. That fact should help contextualize the picayune and arcane level of argumentation over variables accounted for, specific data sets consulted, and number of different specifications tested when scholars try to buttress or refute Lott's thesis. The range of contentious issues involved in Lott's techniques were summed up pretty thoroughly in a sympathetic but critical review of the third** edition in Regulation. The economist Stan Liebowitz of the University of Texas at Dallas wrote: ""Should county level data or state level data be used? Should all counties (or states) be given equal weight? What control variables should be included in the regression? What violent crime categories should be used? How should counties that have zero crimes in a category, such as murder, be treated? How much time after passage of a law is enough to determine the effect of RTC laws? What is the appropriate time period for the analysis?"" Lott tried to demonstrate that on the county level, violent crime trends showed signs of improvement in counties that had or passed RTC laws compared to counties that had not, among other things checking both mean crime rates and the slope of crime rates before and after RTC passage. He attempted to control for many handfuls of other variables that might affect crime rates—indeed, some researchers accused him of accounting for too many variables, while others slammed him for failing to account for other factors, like conviction rates or length of prison sentences. Trying to prove Lott wrong quickly became a cottage industry for others interested in the nexus of guns and public safety. The back-and-forths were so extensive that the latest edition of Lott's book is nearly twice as long, with his reactions to his critics. The U.S. National Research Council (NRC), inspired in part by the Lott debate, assessed the state of the gun controversy in 2004's Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review. The council concluded Lott had not fully proved that RTC laws lowered crime significantly; it also denied that the laws had provably increased crime. ""Answers to some of the most pressing questions cannot be addressed with existing data and research methods,"" study authors Charles F. Wellford, John V. Pepper, and Carol V. Petrie wrote, ""because of the limitations of existing data and methods, [existing findings] do not credibly demonstrate a causal relationship between the ownership of firearms and the causes or prevention of criminal violence."" That statement is perhaps the most important for people trying to use social science to make gun policy to remember, and there is no strong reason to believe the past decade of research has made it obsolete. Lott has maintained for years that, even if his critics were right about his positive effects not being robust enough, if you are contemplating for public policy considerations whether expanded RTC is a good, bad, or neutral idea, no one had yet demonstrated that RTC laws made any relevant crime or safety outcome worse. Then, in 2011, Abhay Aneja, John Donohue, and Alexandria Zhang came out with ""The Impact of Right-to-Carry Laws and the NRC Report: Lessons for the Empirical Evaluation of Law and Policy,"" a paper in the American Law and Economics Review. Working at a very high level of statistical sophistication and running their data through a huge variety of different specifications and assumptions, the authors concluded that ""aggravated assault rises when RTC laws are adopted. For every other crime category, there is little or no indication of any consistent RTC impact on crime."" (While this kind of social science is always working with subtle attempts to figure out how much more certain quantities might have changed had things been different, it's worth noting that while the number of states with ""shall issue"" or unrestricted carry permit laws has more than doubled since 1991, aggravated assault rates overall have fallen by 44 percent since 1995.) The study is suffused with an advanced sense of caution. As the authors write in a 2014 update of that study, ""we show how fragile panel data evidence can be, and how a number of issues must be carefully considered when relying on these methods to study politically and socially explosive topics with direct policy implications."" They stress ""the difficulties in ascertaining the causal effects of legal interventions, and the dangers that exist when policy-makers can simply pick their preferred study from among a wide array of conflicting estimates."" And ""a wide array of conflicting estimates"" is definitely what confronts anyone wading into the social science related to guns and gun laws. Researchers can and should try to go beyond mere binaries about laws existing or not existing when making subtle assessments of causation. Lott, for example, gets as granular as he can when studying RTC laws, considering not just whether they exist or not, but how easy it is to actually obtain a permit where it's legal to do so. If it's more expensive and time-consuming to get one even in a ""shall issue"" state, that will likely blunt the law's causal effects at least somewhat. Along the way, Lott has tried to compile the number of permit holders nationally. He figures the total is 12.8 million, up from 4.6 million as recently as 2007. And now six** states allow so-called ""constitutional carry"" without a permit, creating a pretty much uncountable body of potential RTC practitioners. We still don't know how many people with gun permits actually carry their weapons, and we have no idea about the end of the causal chain of speculations about how such laws affect crime: what potential criminals believe about how many citizens are carrying guns. Do 'Common-Sense Gun Laws' Work? At the top of the list of ""common-sense gun safety laws"" is expanding background checks beyond the current requirements for federally licensed dealers. The underlying belief here is that the various classes of federally prohibited gun owners, such as felons or those adjudicated mentally ill or known to be drug addicts, should never be able to use ""loopholes"" such as buying from a private citizen to get a gun (even though the vast majority of all those categories of people would never misuse a weapon). An April 2015 study by Daniel Webster and three colleagues for the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research earned positive press for claiming that the tougher laws Connecticut passed in 1995 (requiring a background check and a permit for any gun purchase from any source) lowered the state's gun murder rate by 40 percent. Since Connecticut and most of the rest of the country were all enjoying huge murder reductions in the years after that law went into effect, the researchers couldn't meaningfully compare what happened in Connecticut with what happened in the rest of the country. They needed to compare Connecticut's post-law results to what they think would have happened with gun murders in the state had the law not passed. So they created a statistical model of a ""synthetic Connecticut"" that was 72 percent comprised of Rhode Island, based in essence on the principle that past results would guarantee future performance, since in the past Rhode Island's murder rates and changes tended to match Connecticut's. Then they compared the two states from 1996-2005. The results? ""Connecticut Handgun Licensing Law Associated With 40 Percent Drop in Gun Homicides"" blared the Johns Hopkins press release headline. Rhode Island's murder rate went up unusually after 1997 (the researchers don't speculate on why that might have been), thus creating some ""extra"" murders (presuming that choices to murder in Rhode Island would have for some reason created a proportional number of choices to murder in Connecticut) that we can credit Connecticut with having evaded thanks to the more stringent gun law. But what happens when you extend the analytic period beyond the arbitrary cutoff date of 2005? From 2005 to 2012, Connecticut's gun murders per 100,000 people increased 66 percent, from 2.05 to 3.41, while Rhode Island's went down 20 percent, from 1.83 to 1.45. It seems quite premature to take Webster and his team's counterfactual guess about expected murder rates over one 10-year period as establishing any reliable causal knowledge about the effects of tougher gun purchasing laws. Yet that study was used to help buttress a proposed federal law the week it went public, trying to pressure other states into following Connecticut's lead on background checks and permits, given what we now ""know"" about how life-saving that move had been. Webster and his colleagues produced a similar but more rigorous study in 2014. It involved actual counts and not assumptions about what might have happened in a counterfactual, and it didn't stop looking at forward data at the most convenient time for its conclusions. This study tried to prove that Missouri's 2007 repeal of its ""permit to purchase"" law led to a 16 percent increase in murder rates there. Lots of other factors were controlled for, and the numbers indeed showed higher murder rates compared to the U.S. average at the time after the permit law was repealed. It's tricky to credit the permit-to-purchase repeal with causing that rise, because in the four years prior to eliminating the law, Missouri's murder rates had already gone up 15 percent while the national one had stayed essentially the same. This suggests that unaccounted factors influenced Missouri's rising murder rate both before and after the law changed. Even if both studies had been flawless, seeing one thing happening in one place over a limited time is usually not sufficient to establish a scientifically valid causal relationship that policy makers can confidently expect to see replicated elsewhere. Aaron Brown, the chief risk manager at AQR Capital Management and a statistician with interest in gun issues, has lamented that the overarching problem with most of these attempts to learn what effect any element of gun prevalence or gun laws has on any real-world outcome is that there simply aren't enough varied data to be sure of anything. There's another very likely step between ""law exists"" and ""law changes behavior"" that most gun social science doesn't, and likely really can't, account for. After Webster's Connecticut study appeared, I asked him: Since you are presuming a strong causal effect from the law's existence, how did you account for how stringently or effectively the law is enforced? If people continued to blithely sell weapons without background checks or permits, that would blunt the notion the law would have such a strong effect on gun murder rates. Webster's emailed reply: ""Virtually no studies of gun control law take enforcement into account because data are lacking and we don't really know the degree to which deterrence (people not wanting to violate the law) is a function of levels of enforcement."" Unknowables shadow the causal chain in nearly all social science involving any law's effects on behavior. Elusive Knowledge The Duke economist Philip J. Cook put the knowledge problem well in a 2006 Journal of Policy Analysis and Management article. ""Policy analysts are trained to critique evaluation evidence, pointing out potential flaws,"" Cook and co-author Jens Ludwig wrote, ""but are perhaps not so well prepared to judge whether the preponderance of the evidence points in one direction or another."" In other words, the most convincing element of any gun study tends to be the part where one scientist is explaining why another one's causal conclusions don't hold up. The parts where they claim strong or definite policy-relevant causal knowledge tend to be much more questionable. Cook and Ludwig, in their aforementioned 2006 paper ""The Social Costs of Gun Ownership,"" look at this loose link between scientific knowledge and policy differently. They grant that perhaps we're asking more of science than it can give to the policy debate. But that shouldn't stop us from using it to promote more gun law interventions, they maintain. ""Suppose [a certain intervention] implies the treatment reduces gun crime by 25% but the p-value on this point estimate is just .15, short of the conventional .05 cutoff,"" they wrote. ""Any academic referee worth her salt would reject a paper submitted for scientific publication that claimed this intervention 'worked.'"" But, Cook and Ludwig wonder, are those scientific standards too rigorous for statecraft? ""Would that referee really want to live in a jurisdiction where this evidence persuaded policymakers that they should not adopt the new treatment, but rather stick with the status quo?"" As Harvard's Hemenway explained to me, the confidence intervals of the social sciences in colloquial terms demand a belief that the chances are 19 to 1, or at worst 10 to 1, for you being right about your conclusion before you accept it as provisionally verified. Hemenway also believes, given the good he thinks can come from legal interventions about guns, that we don't need to be that certain we are right for policy work. But that's easier to accept if you don't value any particular benefits to relatively unrestricted private gun ownership—scientific, constitutional, or just personal. Some researchers, particularly in the public health field, act as if there were no values to balance on the other side of the policy goal of making it harder for people to get guns. Whether you consider the associations and causations supposedly demonstrated by gun-related social sciences to be proven beyond whatever level of doubt you see as appropriate, applying those stipulated facts to policy questions can never itself be a purely mathematical or scientific process. It's politics all the way down, and that politics is less informed by rigorous and certain knowledge than President Obama thinks. **Correction: The article originally and incorrectly stated that it was the first edition of Lott's book being reviewed, and that there were only four constitutional carry states.

There once was a girl from Brighton Whose boyfriend said “My, that’s a tight one” She said “You poor soul” “You’ve got the wrong hole” “But there’s plenty of room in the right one!” Rhymed a word with itself – no points. SHIT!!! I just made that point yesterday!! But – in my defense – I was rhyming “tight one” with “right one” …. not “one” and “one”. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it…. Ats a right proper rhyme, that is. You’re rhyming two syllables (i.e. Brighton) and you get FULL CREDIT. YAY ME!!! My last pay check was $9500 working 12 hours a week online.

Does this asshole even have the ability to make a statement without lying? THE SOCIAL SCIENCE IS SETTLED!!!! WHY DO YOU WANT CHILDREN TO DIE?!?!?! Because Planned Parenthood Profits depend on it? /not really my position. Still a good point, tho. As we know, immigration and abortion are the two areas where us *libertarian-like creatures* will never agree…. I think it might be easier to cover those topics where there is agreement. Judging by the ven-diagram of opinion sets on this commentariat (troll outliers removed) I think the only overlap can be summed up in the repeated refrain “fuck you, cut spending”. Ironic that two government employees agree on that… How can you be a libertarian while working for the government, or accepting any government benefits, such as roads, utilities, etc.? /troll outlier A: I’m not a libertarian. I’m a fiscal and social conservative. B: It’s a job. I provide a service, they pay me, just like any other employer. Also, there’s nothing that says an employee cannot be critical of the actions or policies of their employer, public or private. (unless you’re a spokesperson and you have a contract where your job is shilling said employer, etc. But I work in IT). C: If the roads, and utilities were not a government-backed monopoly, I’d have the ability to do business with someone else. As it stands we’re forbidden from having the choice. yes, I know your comment was snark, but I felt compelled to answer it. Hey, man. Whatever helps you sleep at night. You don’t even want to know what I do for the government….but I’m still a libertarian! You’re our NSA plant? And if I was would you hold it against me?!?! Well put, although I personally chose never to work as a gov’t employee after having worked for them before. The deciding moment was when my bureaucrat boss told me to go buy a $10,000 printer for $30,000 so that we could use up our budget and not lose it the next year. I wondered: if my department is doing this, how many other departments are doing this, and how much taxpayer money are they wasting overall? Can I be a part of this wholesale waste and look at myself in the mirror every morning? The answer for me is no. So is muck at the bottom of a lake, and dead fish, and the Titanic. Lies. Damned lies. And Statistics. He makes sure to cram all three into each and every statement he makes. “We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths.” We also know that large cities like Chicago where gun laws are the strongest have more gun deaths on any given weekend than rural areas have in a year. I live in a rural Louisiana parish. We had no gun deaths last year, or the year before. In fact our last shooting was in 2011 and no one was killed. How many shootings were there in Chicago last weekend? D.C.? New Orleans? You can count on gun grabbers to lie like you can count on the sunrise. Before guns were invented, there were zero gun deaths. However, there was far from a lack of violence or death of any kind. Before guns were invented, there were zero gun deaths. And lo, there was a great silence across the land as each progressive knelt and pondered a previously unconsidered truth. There was no income tax before there were guns. The income tax of 1848 in the Communist Manifesto requires men with guns to go out and collect the tax, as belabored by Lysander Spooner. Ergo, no guns, no income tax. Whose side are the sensitive, concerned and aware progressive socialists on, anyway? What if the tax collector had a pointed stick? Or at least some fresh fruit? Of course not. He can’t open his pie hole without telling a ie. Right from the start, even the word “We” is a lie! Good morning. Also, GREAT article by Doherty… No kidding…I laughed, I cried, I raged, and I rejoiced. “The Force Awakens and Gets a Cuppa” isn’t as good as this article. Article? There are articles on reason? They are the non-essential filler before the comments. Sort of like a salad before your steak and baked potato. Well, yeah. But nobody actually reads them. …Do they? You start, but then it gets boring, so once you have the gist: On to the comments! I read Shikha’s articles, but only if I need to induce vomiting. This might be the biggest Tony signal in recent memory. Hopefully he had to call in sick today. I thought the Tomy Signal was an image of an 11 year old boy with his pants pulled down bent over. The bottom line is that statists like Barack Obama don’t want Americans to do for themselves. The state knows better than you your wants and needs, and what is required of you to contribute to the health of the state. For you to be able to defend yourself against an aggressive fellow citizen means you could also defend yourself against state agents coming with your orders. The more we rely on the state for anything, the more power it has. Central planning requires powerful hand and fails when the chess pieces can resist their moves around the board. Armed chess pieces are especially troublesome. It’s easy to paint those who correctly make the 2nd Amendment about a check on government power as crazies, because most people are ignorant of the history of powerful governments or incorrectly believe that this powerful government will stop at their doorstep. So we will continue to get lies and obfuscations about guns because they know that the 2nd Amendment is the greatest barrier we have against successful central planning. It seems to me,with the antics of those in the Secret Service,maybe they need to be disarmed. Coke ,alcohol ,hookers and guns are not a good mix. Coke ,alcohol ,hookers and guns are not a good mix. But it does make for a helluva Saturday night. Coke ,alcohol ,hookers and guns are not a good mix. I don’t think you are a True Libertarian. Hey, he didn’t say one word about ass sex, weed, or Mexicans. But it would make for a great convenience store. This brings up a point I have been meaning to address, Fist. We all know the quote from Solzhenitsyn about ” “And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family?…” But – and this may be off topic – someone in the commentariat here brought up that it is this very same sentiment – a sentiment that we all approve of – that the cops use to justify murdering citizens with impunity because “they don’t have to risk their lives just to determine if it was a cell phone or a gun!” How do we still agree with Solzhenitsyn’s quote and still logically call for police reform? If our sentiments are in agreement with the quote, aren’t cops justified in being the pants-shitting pussies that murder children? I would say there is a qualitative difference between the kind of Gestapo/Statsi agent who rounds up adults for political crimes and simply out of control cops who escalate situations with under-age people who don’t have the understanding or self-control of a mature adult. The former are enforcing the rules of a police state where the “crimes” they enforce are understood by all even if they might not have true legitimacy. The latter just don’t seem to think they have to make room for people who might not expect – through lack of maturity, experience, or understanding – that they are about to be shot. They’re not justified in feeling that scared if they’re not actually threatened, and they’re not. Nikki, you’re gonna have a hard time convincing THEM of that when it has been an integral part of their rookie training for DECADES… No. If you’re scared of that, either don’t fuck up or don’t become a cop. How do we still agree with Solzhenitsyn’s quote and still logically call for police reform? Something like “Your cop tribe will continue to get gunned down by armed citizens unless and until they reform”? There aren’t enough SWAT teams, and never will be, to send a fully gunned-up squad every time a door needs kicking down. The critical piece that would accelerate this badly-needed rebalancing is laws and/or juries who recognize that citizens have a right to defend themselves against cops. The critical piece that would accelerate this badly-needed rebalancing is laws and/or juries who recognize that citizens have a right to defend themselves against cops. Or, perhaps just as good, juries who understand that citizens have a right to defend themselves from cops, regardless of any laws to the contrary, and recognize that they’re empowered to recognize this right, regardless of a judge’s instructions to the contrary. I think the essence of the reform at least I’m looking to see has to do with a change in the nature of the relationship between police and non-police, specifically the power dynamic. Currently, police are the authority, and non-police essentially have to hope that police behave in a fair, just manner. Ideally, and I think you get this in a situation where police don’t have a monopoly on force, police should behave as disinterested third-party mediators and as the defenders of last resort. Frankly, if someone is legally empowered to use deadly force against someone outside the scope of self-defense, that person’s power should absolutely be tempered by the cost of possibly being killed. If you’re willing to use lethal force to prevent someone from selling loose cigarettes, for example, the calculus of the decision changes once real personal risk enters the equation, and I believe that’s as it should be. You are undoubtedly the most ignorant fool that posts here. This is correct, not only because of the direct power of resistance afforded by being armed but also because someone who provides for his own self-defense tends to an annoying habit of taking care of himself in other ways. We are skeptical of state intervention in all areas of life. The progs find our lack of faith disturbing. i.e. Central planners know they cannot enact their preferred policies with an armed populace. That really says all we need to know about those policies. yup. the kinyun and his minions have a strong policy standard: thy government is thy god and thou shalt have no other gods before it. And individual subjects of that god must never be allowed the priviledge of making their own decisions, nor of taking responsibility for their own lives. They fail to comprehend that that much hated Second declares that “the security of a free state” rests on “the people”. Clearly NOT on government, as god or otherwise. Nor on military nor police nor…….. I’d really like to see a study that removed the top 10% of counties per population density and showed the homicide and violent crime rates of the remaining 90% compared to the counties removed. I’m willing to bet the homicide rate is at least 4x higher in the removed counties than in the remaining 90%. And I bet the laws in place in the states don’t cause much variance in crime rates when compared to population density. The actual correlation appears to be poverty and population density, not strict density. The more poor people piled on top of each other, the worse the crime gets (almost exponentially so). Looking at the rough statistics I noticed something interesting. There is a rapid drop-off in density within the top ten territories. (Several of these are subordinate components of other states, but the shape of that curve is impressive) Numbers are persons per square mile: 1 Macau (China) 54,970 2 Monaco 48,951 3 Singapore 19,935 4 Hong Kong (China) 17,019 5 Gibraltar (UK) 11,007 6 Vatican City 4,709 7 Bahrain 4,224 8 Malta 3,421 9 Bermuda (UK) 3,139 10 Bangladesh 2,871 As a comparison: 182 United States 85.02 One bone I have to pick with this – while, yes, the headcount per square mile for the US is 85.02 there are very few Americans who live in areas which are that unpopulated. It would make more sense to calculate the average local population density for each American. Look at it this way – if somehow Singapore gained ownership of Antarctica would the average Singaporean suddenly have more living space? Yes, I was going to add another point for NYC at 27,000 p/sqmi Which provides another interesting comparison because Signapore and Monaco have far less crime than NYC. Across the river in Union City, NJ the density is even greater (IIRC, 57,000 per square mile) and they have a slightly lower crime rate than NYC. Look at Chicago for conformation of your opinion. Not a good bet. I meant in the US. Singapore is an outlier I kept reading that as “Countries” not “Counties” Ugh. Silly me. I imagine that it tracks closer to counties with high participation in assistance programs. The rural counties in KY that are fueled by welfare are violent as all get out. Especially intrafamily murders. And don’t forget the hillbilly feuds! ‘Hunting accidents’ . ‘I thought it was the orange-vested deer, honest’ ‘He was coming right at me’!! ‘He was coming right at me’!! So… the hunters shot each other? Were the squirrels to blame? Damn tree rats. Hillbillies cause a lot fewer deaths then Inner city gangs. “I’m willing to bet the homicide rate is at least 4x higher…” 1000x would probably be a safe bet. I like to mention this when people compare Canada and the US in terms of homicides and gun laws. Canada has two areas with pop. densities greater than 250/sq.km., where the US has way more than that. I’d be more interested in separating out each gross data set into a county by county data set, analising each “population” separately, then comparing them by population density for the variables and controls. You bet, the murder rates in dense city areas WILL be higher than in rural counties. As well, the gun ownership/CCL ratios per person will radically change between dense urban settings and spare rural ones. I believe the total number of CCL’s in Los Angeles County California is well under a hundred (and it is certain most of those are to somebodies who are SOMEBODY (as in, more equal pigs) while at the same time, Tulare County, 150 miles to the north in sparse Central Valley farm country (or what WAS farms until the Three Inch Delta Smelt acceded to the throne in the temple and MUST be bowed down to and worshipped) has a population of about 100,000 but the sheriff in that county has issued more than FOUR THOUSAND permits. Now, compare violent crime rates, and even housebreakings: Tulare County is FAR safer to live in than Los Angeles County. MANY TIMES more guns, a fraction of violent crimes and housebreakings. Could there be a correlation between those stats? I rather think so…. Poor NYC. First they find out that deep dish is better, and now this: http://www.foxnews.com/leisure…..ntcmp=hpff Deep dish is better than what? Certainly not better than actual pizza. In a blind taste test, Deep Dish beat out Hard tack. How could it be blind? Completely different textures – one is a pizza, and one is some sort of bastard casserole. Deep dish tastes okay, but it is not pizza. A pizza/casserole hybrid? Real Italian pizza is deep dish. It’s known as pizza pie. I’m sorry, but I’m siding with the anti-scoopers. This is pretty much how I feel. “It was the moment I realized my ex was a monster,” Lisa Rosenberg, a 27-year-old graphic designer living in Bushwick, Brooklyn, says of a guy she dated for about a year. “Even watching someone eating [a scooped-out bagel] is completely repulsive.” bagel scoopers are lumped in with people who eat their pizza with a fork This makes me so fucking angry!!!! I eat my deep dish pizza with a fork! One: Deep Dish is not pizza, it’s casserole, and thus forking it is acceptable behaviour. Two: What the fuck is “Bagel Scooping”? They scoop out the insides of a split bagel with a spoon, leaving only the “skin.” That’s barbaric! Break their fingers until they learn to stop doing such awful things to food. Same here UnCivil. I read the article but it is just word salad to me. I don’t know what any of that means. *takes another bite of delicious toasted buttery English Muffin* Now I keep thinking of bagel sandwiches. (replace standard bread or roll with bagel of choice.) I vote either cheddar cheese or salt for a pastrami and swiss sandwich. If only I had time to swing by the store on my way home… Bialy: The delicious miscegenation of bagels and English Muffins. The funny thing is, the stores tag the bialy at a higher price to the bagels, but the cahsiers always ring them up as bagels, even when you state uneequivocally that they’re bialys. I had a surprisingly good bialy in Seattle. Big, with lots of onions and cheese. Were they trying to make a pizza and failed? Well, “lots” in comparison to the NYC version. It was the bread for a smoked salmon scramble and goat cheese sandwich. So good. Look. Guns are an efficient way to kill. There’s no denying that. So therefore that means that the mere presence of a gun increases the risk of death. How could it not? Prove that it doesn’t. And don’t go and cite “statistics” gathered by those stupid right-wingers. Their studies are tainted because of their politics. You can only cite studies by people who support gun control. There. You can’t do it. Ha ha. You’re wrong. Sadly, this is what actual proggies really believe. I would say that owning a car increases the risk of death too.Maybe at a higher rate Same goes for swimming pools. And ladders And living next to Warty. You violated the exclusion zone, we accept no liability for your actions. Two story homes? Or homes with lots of front steps? What about hammers, baseball bats and other blunt instruments? Owning a car increases the risk of death to everyone, being that it increases global climate change. Re: Sarcasmic, Guns are an efficient way to kill. Actually, the most efficient way to kill is with poison. A person has to become proficient in the use of a gun before he or she can use it with “efficiency” which would mean shooting A bullet (not two or several) in the head or directly to the heart. Gaining such proficiency takes a lot of practice. Instead, to poison a person does not require any special skills from the murderer. I have made this point to several Marxian posters in FB and they still think a gun is infallible and 100% deadly. They have this image of the pioneer women in old matinee movies who always felled an Indian by pointing the musket anywhere. I don’t know who made the claim that guns are the most efficient way to kill. So while your argument does have merit, you’re wasting it on a straw man. Why do you want to make the world unsafe for strawmen? *opens a case of 7.62 incendiary rounds* I kinda wish they’d have released a ‘making of’ or BTS video for this. Guns are an efficient way to kill. There’s no denying that. So therefore that means that the mere presence of a gun increases the risk of death. How could it not? Prove that it doesn’t. If the mere presence of a gun increases the risk of death, then the huge increase in private ownership of firearms over the last two decades, and particularly the greatly increased presence of guns carried in public, should have resulted in the blood-running-in-the-streets scenario predicted by the anti-gun folk. Instead, (using statistics gathered by the FBI, which is not made up of stupid right-wingers) deaths are dropping. While that doesn’t prove that the increase in gun ownership is causing the drop in deaths, it clearly shows that the increase in gun ownership isn’t causing deaths to increase. Because they aren’t. 🙂 “There’s scientific consensus on guns?and the NRA won’t like it.” You know, a while ago there was this place where there was scientific consensus on Jews, and look what happened! Aaaand….*ACT*! But don’t let anybody snooker you with that line about “guns are only for killing”. Wrong. A guillotine is only for killing – it has no other purpose (it can be purposed for other things but those are not the purpose of a guillotine). A firearm is a tool for managing a violent encounter. It carries the potential for pain, injury, and death and in that can be used to negotiate through and possibly avoid injury during a violent encounter but all that depends on the skill of the user. I own several firearms that were expressly designed for poking holes in small pieces of paper at a known distance. Are they still only for killing? Killing what? Paper? (Based on an actual conversation with a progtard colleague, by the way.) “I own several firearms” You’ve probably been duped. These are air guns unless I’m mistaken. Not firearms. The lack of fire is the give away. Nope. A Ruger Competition Target, while only a .22, is a firearm. So is a .22 caliber 1930s-vintage Colt Officer’s Target. “guns are only for killing”. Wrong.” Only a fool would use a gun for something other than killing or wounding. Those clowns in Oregon, for example, armed themselves to the teeth and didn’t use their guns for anything other than waving about trying to look tough. They never fired a shot and now they’re in prison. If you are not prepared to use a gun properly, you have no business carrying one. They are not fashion accessories. Original statement: “guns are only for killing” Response: “Only a fool would use a gun for something other than killing or wounding.” Yeah, so…. you said something about fools, do they, by any chance, strawman? Also, target shooting is an actual sport. “target shooting is an actual sport” They were brandishing their guns. Not shooting, not killing, not wounding, not sporting. If these clowns had no idea of using guns as god intended, they shouldn’t have had them in the first place. It’s mark trueman. He says stupid & nonsensical things for the express purpose of getting one or more people riled up to the point they respond. By keeping his pronouncements sufficiently cryptic and facilely changing his argument, sometimes by redefining words in hilariously wrong ways, he entertains himself for hours pissing people off. The sensible thing to do is to ignore him. He is utterly useless and worthless. There literally is no benefit to interacting with him at all. Great article, Mr. Dougherty. I do want to pick just one nit. I think you’re probably being a bit too generous in saying that the science isn’t clear. It sounds a lot more to me like the takeaway here is that the research is cooked. Agree, fantastic article. Some things defy scientific analysis, because there are too many variables and science is impossible unless you can eliminate, or minimize, the existence of variables. Human interactions are such a thing, thus the concept of “social science” is a canard. Wait, I thought the CDC was forbidden to study gun violence for the last 20+ years… where is all this data coming from? Good thing Obama is going to make a new law today saying the CDC can now study gun violence again. We’ll finally have some statistics to use in our policy-making. CDC? No. Obama’s asshole? probably. Where he pulls a lot of his other lies. Obama gets an E for effort for his well intentions as far as guns are concerned. However, nothing will be accomplished with this STUPID executive order. There’s no way to enforce person A selling or giving away a gun to person B. Besides, the retards and the criminals will not register. They will simply buy the guns from the street. Or in the case of Sandy Hook, the retard will simply take the guns from his mother. I Tell you, the only good thing that came out of the Sandy Hook Shooting is that the Retard Kid first killed the biggest retard of them all, his Mother. One less so-called responsible gun owner to deal with in America. None of the legislation ever proposed after a shooring would have prevented the shooting . They’re never even remotely connected. Which tells you that the legislation is never about prevention in the first place. Its juat part of they’re incremental eating away at the 2nd while atanding on dead bobies. That is the goal. Agreed. It’s just political grand standing. No law in America is effective in combating gun crime. Each an every law created in the gun control effort only stops (or slows down) people that want to own guns. The criminals and Retards have full access to guns in America since guns are so ubiquitous. “The criminals and Retards have full access to guns in America since guns are so ubiquitous.” I think you underestimate the resourcefulness of people. If criminals and retards have full access to guns, then surely the same goes for the rest of us. *YAWN* He gets an A for Asshole. The effort isn’t about preventing another mass shooting since no law would have prevented any mass shooting. “the retards and the criminals will not register” Register what? Do you know what you are talking about? People who intend to commit crimes with their guns will simply find illegal means of acquiring their guns. Your telling me that criminals commit crimes that they are not allowed to? I refuse to believe that. has anyone tried telling them not to be criminals? /progderp Expecting a gun law to keep guns out of the hands of criminals is like putting up a fence to keep out birds. One flaw with that analogy – you can design a fence that stops birds, though it resembles a cage more than a fence. I prefer my 12 gauge O\U. has anyone tried telling them not to be criminals? Teach Criminals Not to Crime! Like that? There should be a law against commiting crimes Another of National Journal’s mistakes is a common one in gun science: The paper didn’t look at gun statistics in the context of overall violent crime, a much more relevant measure to the policy debate. After all, if less gun crime doesn’t mean less crime overall?if criminals simply substitute other weapons or means when guns are less available?the benefit of the relevant gun laws is thrown into doubt. I know Doherty is just trying to be generous, but that’s not a “mistake.” It’s data pimping, which is the natural result of positivism & physics envy taking over the social sciences and most people’s reluctance/inability to tackle the intimidating combination of reams of statistics and men whose extraordinary confidence is matched only by their ignorance. When I have to debate GC advocates, the first point I usually make is that we’re not interested in gun violence, but all violence. I have yet to meet a single person who was prepared for that, which goes to show the depth of ignorance we’re dealing with here. It’s no wonder they have the confidence of a fundamentalist preacher–they’re completely ignorant of the most basic facts about the issue. Damned! You beaten me to the punch! We’re just shouting into an Austrian echo chamber anyway. Positivism will continue to march ahead until a generation of philosophers comes along that’s willing to kill it. Another of National Journal’s mistakes is a common one in gun science: The paper didn’t look at gun statistics in the context of overall violent crime, a much more relevant measure to the policy debate. You say this as if these were honest mistakes that crept in those studies rather than a purposeful skewing of the data to prop up a particular narrative, Brian. I don’t see much difference between these studies that ostensibly show a direct correlation between more gun ownership and violent crime and current “Climate” science, with its penchant for moving the goal posts as expediency dictates, the most recent and egregious case being the scandalous change (which they called it “adjustments”) in temperatures by the NOAA. TEH SYENSE IZ SETTELLED!!!11!1!!! HERTIK!!!1!!!!!!!! FILTHEE SYENSE DENYER!!11!!1111!!!!!!! /progtard According to the CDC’s National Vital Statistics System, 21,175 Americans committed suicide with firearms in 2013, more than twice as many as used the next most popular suicide method, suffocation. I wonder how many of those suffocations were from auto-erotic asphyxiation related accidents? Should those really be counted as suicides? This was an excellent article but who beyond Reasonoids are going to read it? Facts and statistics matter very little when there’s an endless supply of unethical social scientists who 1) arrive at a politically motivated conclusion, 2) design studies that are customized to support that conclusion, and 3) release those conclusions to a compliant and sympathetic (and in some cases ignorant and stupid) press with the collusion of a political class that don’t give a tinker’s damn about what the truth of the matter is.. Their MO is twisting facts to reach a foregone conclusion and good luck convincing the left their science isn’t really science (it isn’t), you right wing, knuckledragging, children hating, gun fetishists. No point attempting to reason with or negotiate with progtards anymore. As long as there are people willing to kill people, people will need the right to be armed. We have the 2nd Amendment not to protect against the fools we have voted for now, but in case we vote for Mussolini or Hitler like fools in the future. Most gun deaths are from: 2006 Total (30896) 55% Suicides (16992) 41% Homicides (12667) 2% Unintentional (accidents) (618) 1% Legal Intervention (309) 1% Other (309) 2010 Total (31,076) 62% Suicides (19392) 35 % Homicides (11,078) 2% Unintentional (accidents) (606) Better mental health is the best way to decrease suicides. Solutions to gun violence: 1. Remove public-sector gun free zones. 2. Enact better mental health laws and treatment. (Mandatory treatment for those adjudicated violent mentally ill.) 3. End the drug war and decriminalize drugs. Allow teachers to be armed if they wish. Require they are trained.

Because, despite their claims to the contrary, libs/progs would be happy to see some of those “happenings” directed at non-libs/progs. Just as long as those doing the “happening” are in service of the state. Don’t see too many libs/progs wanting the security details surrounding lob/prog politicians to be disarmed. So the porous border liberals, who are OK with whatever and whoever strolling into the US, are fighting vehemently for for stricter gun laws in America? Mmmkay. Gun ban advocates in this country routinely perform the scam of including gun suicides in “gun death”, more than 60% of the total. Suicides are a voluntary act committed by people with many deep problems, and they choose a gun or other means to end their difficult existence. But including them into “gun death” greatly inflates the statistic and it is regularly mindlessly regurgitated by our ignorant media. Consider the top four methods of suicide in the US: Someone who commits suicide by jumping off a bridge or structure is not a victim of Bridge Violence or Building Violence. Someone who commits suicide by Poisoning is not a victim of Drug Violence or Natural Gas Violence. Someone who commits suicide by hanging himself is not a victim of Rope Violence. Someone who commits suicide by using a gun is not a victim of Gun Violence. They also include homicides with murders. Many of those homicides belong to criminals who, in the process of committing a crime, wind up getting shot. You’ll forgive me if I don’t shed too many tears over an attempted rape that concludes with the would-be rapist’s death by gunshot. Colonel Jeff Cooper has some wisdom on the subject of violence: “One bleeding-heart type asked me in a recent interview if I did not agree that ‘violence begets violence.’ I told him that it is my earnest endeavor to see that it does. I would like very much to ensure ? and in some cases I have ? that any man who offers violence to his fellow citizen begets a whole lot more in return than he can enjoy.” According to that logic, Police officers carry guns and Nuns do not. Nuns are shot at a vastly lower rate than Police. Disarm the Police? Arm the nuns. Regarding reporting of defensive gun use, the article notes, “There are no even halfway thorough documentations of every such event in America. They are not all going to end up reported in the media or to the police.” Perhaps one of the main reasons DGUs are underreported to authorities is that making such a report carries risks of its own, such as what actually happened to a good friend of mine some years back in Eugene, Oregon. He heard someone on his back porch trying to jimmy open his sliding glass door, so he flicked on the living room lights and the would-be burglar found himself staring down the barrel of my friend’s Glock. The bad guy fled–most likely with a sizable load of excrement in his pants, and my friend dutifully called the cops to report the incident. They dispatched two officers to take his statement, at the conclusion of which one of them said–ever so politely–“We’re going to need to take your gun with us.” Fortunately my friend, who is the son of a police officer and has a lot of friends who are lawyers, knew his rights and told the cop to go boil his head. But had the cop not eventually backed down, this could have gone sideways in a hurry. And I’m willing to bet if there’s ever a similar incident, the last thing he’ll think of doing will be to call the cops. When the people you call for help end up trying to rob you themselves, is it any wonder we would all just prefer to provide our own security with our own privately held firearms? That’s horrible. And I’m willing to bet if there’s ever a similar incident, the last thing he’ll think of doing will be to call the cops. The police: encouraging self-reliance and RKBA advocacy one 911 call at a time. Indeed, that was a discouragement of making a DGU report. Which makes the survey-based minimal 55,000-80,000/yr estimate of such DGU incidents, not drawn from any official records, all the more MINIMAL. Asset-forfeiture has already turned government personnel into “looters-by-law” and the 2007 crash and depression was the practical application of The Money Speech straight out of Atlas Shrugged. In a recent George Will column he reported that in 2013 more property was taken by asset forfeiture than by thieves. We are now living in a kleptocracy (as if it wasn’t before.) Link please? Look, nobody’s gonna convince a progressive (indoctrinated by a life of bullshit) to stop pursuing a “gun-free world.” NADA. All this Obama crap is designed to move the ball incrementally towards their goal – the executive orders, the bullshit consensus, the media shit-eaters. This is political and the people who support liberty and citizen’s rights over government power are pissing in the wind to try to convince the progressive gunphobes otherwise. Instead of playing defense and digging in to slow the forward movement, we need to find leaders who will take the game to offense and start passing laws that eliminate ANY and all gun restrictions and laws that support the 2nd amendment. Stop accepting gunhating judges, stop funding departments that support infringement. The left will shit its collective self and things will change for the better. Imagine that all our liberties were supported by our representatives. Okay. I already vote libertarian, and I know that “the case for voting Libertarian” is that it gets moronic laws repealed. i commend Doherty on his civility and courtesy. Great article, thanks for putting it together Google pay 97$ per hour my last pay check was $8500 working 1o hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for months now and he works about 22 hours a week. I cant believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is wha- I do…… ?????? http://www.buzznews99.com That was a very well researched and written article. Thanks for your efforts. In an issue so fraught with emotion, articles like this aren’t especially common, and this level of detail is even more rare. Thanks again. I don’t see why we can’t find a compromise on these issues. Communists and Dems don’t like the Second Amendment, fine. But cars, according to The Atlantic, still kill more people than guns–and there is no constitutional amendment protecting auto ownership. Recently in Austin TX a berserker named Rashad recently committed plural murder driving a car into a crowd. So where are the handwringing cries of Ban! Ban! and Terrorism? Banning automobiles would show voters Congress is serious and not hypocritical, and would pave the way for disarming enforcement personnel and enacting Barry Commoner gun laws. Libertarians don’t like the individual income tax, and point to roads that existed before its 1914 enactment. With no cars, communists would not need the income tax for the roads they refuse to believe already existed. So a ban on deadly automobiles would also… er… pave the way for repealing the other force amendment, as destructive of individual rights as the prohibition amendment turned out to be. Is that meant to be some form of satire? Hank, your comment, let’s say is just stupid. You might want to mention that Lott is infamous for not being able to produce the data from the surveys he based his 1997 paper on. That’s a huge red flag and when you cite him to people in the know, you lose credibility. He’s in the same category as Michael LaCour, so I think you should at least mention that and explain why you think his current research is meaningful. That being said, there is plenty of social science that comes to the same conclusion Lott does. It’s just that referencing him will give people on the anti gun side an easy target to attack. Also, mentioning that prisoners in from Cook County, IL got guns through social connections triggers alarm bells. That’s Chicago, with very strict gun laws. So it’s evidence that criminals will get guns even if there are strict laws (as long as it’s easy to move guns from places with permissive laws to places with strict laws,) it’s not a great indication that criminals in general get guns through social ties. Prisoners in, say, Texas, would be a better source of evidence for that. As it stands, this just adds fuel to the fire that we should have strict national laws because local laws can’t control what people do outside their jurisdiction. Other than that, I really enjoyed the article. You might want to mention that Lott is infamous for not being able to produce the data from the surveys he based his 1997 paper on. I believe only the data from one survey was lost in a (verified as fact) hard drive crash, and the survey was largely redone from scratch, producing very similar outcomes to the original surveys. No one so far has pointed out that the anti-gun “studies” all seem to come from Harvard. You’d think that, were there really consensus on the subject, SOME might come from the University of Nebraska or Colorado State, &c. There can be no correlation between gun ownership, gun regulation, and crimes with guns. As one poster pointed out, there are more shootings in Chicago in a week than there have been in his corner of Louisiana in 5 years. That is not because of gun control or the failure of gun control; it is because of Chicago, where even police routinely shoot African Americans in the street. If the polity is of a mind to tolerate using guns for violent crime, it should come as no sociological revelation that gun crime will increase. Furthermore, even if all these self-appointed Harvard experts were right, their findings are irrelevant. Guns won their place in the Constitution not so we could kill the hedgehogs and certainly not so we could kill each other. Guns won their place in the Constitution to ensure the balance of power by which we ultimately secure liberty. Indeed, we accept democracy as the primary means of settling political disputes precisely because it’s more sensible to throw balls of paper at opponents than balls of steel. There’s no reason for a minority to pay any attention to a democratic result if the winners aren’t prepared to back up their con with a sufficiency of force. But, where in these Harvard “studies” has anyone measured that? For the sake of argument let us assume that more guns mean more crime, murder, suicide, accidental shootings and cause diabetes. The whole idea of protecting the God Given Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms is to protect us from a tyrannical government; not so I can hunt, put holes in paper or even keep the local outlaw from mugging me. I am quite willing to put up with a larger amount of gun deaths so that I and my fellow citizens can protect ourselves from our government. In the same way I am willing to put up with a certain amount of car related deaths so that I and my fellow citizens can travel where we want efficiently. The correct reply to this and all “studies” that “prove” that guns are bad for me and the children is “Fuck Off Slaver”! Also, “cold dead fingers” should have gone somewhere in there. “Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.” –Ben Franklin Thus, some soccer mom claiming a “right” to feel safe does not trump our right to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government. The evils of a tyrannical government are far worse than the sneak thief in the night or the worry of a foreign invader. A tyrannical government combines the worst of both. I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty, than those attending too small a degree of it. — Thomas Jefferson “There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America,” President Barack Obama proclaimed after the October mass shooting that killed 10 at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Where do I get mine? At your local gun dealer. But hurry – – – – – – Why even bother using stats? They’re irrelevant even if true. The 2nd Amendment was, at least in part, an effort to keep the government in check by having an armed citizenry. “The 2nd Amendment was, at least in part, an effort to keep the government in check by having an armed citizenry.” As long as this armed citizenry of yours is more content to live on their knees than to die on their feet, all the 2nd Amendments in the world aren’t going to keep a government in check. In the nearly 240 years of this Republic we have transitioned from the frontiersman to the suburbanite lifestyle. The self-reliant, utterly free frontiersman is gone, replaced by others who have an interdependence on each other for their existence. If a president gave Obama’s speech in, say 1816, there would have been a mob of angry individualists with torches and rifles banging on the White House doors demanding his hide. We’re more likely today to “play by the rules” of legal actions and protests instead of direct action. This was even the case in 1775. The colonists suffered many years under the Crown before declaring independence. “Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.” We simply have not reached the point of contempt for the government that existed in 1775. Very nice review, thanks. However, I was surprised to see it twice mentioned that failure to determine if an owner’s gun were used against them was a flaw in associating a gun in the home with outcome of a criminal event. While an interesting aspect in its own right, it’s plainly not a necessary condition to claiming that association. An assailant doesn’t have to possess your gun for it, or even the presumption of it, to alter their behavior. Both sides readily make that claim. It’s more relevant to know whether the gun actually factored in – to what extent was it brought to bear, rather than simple being a demographic factor? I think I know what you’re trying to say. However, given the thrust of the Kellerman study which claimed that having a gun increased your risk of death, establishing whether the gun was involved in the death IS necessary. If a study claimed that owning a box of Corn Flakes increased your risk of death, a necessary part of that study would be to establish a relationship between the cereal and the death. That a homicide victim merely owned a gun has no more significance with regard to his/her risk of death than the fact that they had a box of Corn Flakes or they were a black belt in Karate. I think we’re saying the same thing. You might not die from eating the Corn Flakes, your sister might kill you for emptying the box. “…whether the gun was involved in death…” plainly encompasses more than having the gun turned on you. Not that I in the least disfavor wide latitude in self defense including ready access to a gun, just pointing out a twice-made statement that exhibited poor logic. Guns used for suicide is nobody else’s business. Guns used for mass shootings are an outlier. Guns used in homicides outside of “mass shootings” are largely part of the de facto wars fought by the black (no pun intended because Whites and Hispanics are a part of the subset) marketeers. We have large scale wars fought by the “legitimate” institutions (the laundered mafia known as governments) and we have small scale wars being fought by the shadow markets of organized crime. Nothing the Feds do will impact the availability of ordnance for those fighting their turf wars in our inner cities, leaking out into some suburbs. What remains of white gangs tend to move their venues for battle around while the blacks and hispanics fight over city blocks, sometimes house by house. Idiotic, blanket rules sticking red tape to the 99.99% who aren’t a problem does no good. I firmly believe the likes of Obama knows this, but the “laundered mafia” has every interest in disarming the 99.99% as best they can for their own interests. The intent of gun laws isn’t to lessen crime or even lessen the # of guns. It’s for some people to pat themselves on the back that they forced someone else to comply with something against their will. It’s really just a purely human motivation about the abuse of petty power. One HUGE problem comparing violent gun usage rates between states and cities is that researchers simply refuse to consider what is likely the SINGLE most important factor — race. See? Me even SAYING “race” makes you cringe. But consider: Blacks constitute about 13.2% of America’s population. http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html Yet when it comes to crime, the FBI reports that in 2012 blacks committed: 49.4% of all murders 32.5% of all forcible rapes 54.9% of all robberies 34.1% of all aggravated assaults 28.1% of ALL crime http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cj…..verviewpdf Where are the studies relating murder rates to signs of the Zodiac? To phrenology? Where they belong. In the minds of mystics and weak-minded people. I remember that a newspaper in Baltimore added an interactive crime map to their website for while. You could examine crimes by type over several time periods and map their locations. It was all grins and giggles until someone posted a screen capture of homicides. The crime locations clustered around the predominately black neighborhoods with only a very few in other areas. It was quite the eye opener. But the map disappeared from the website shortly afterward without explanation. Below are the 30 cities with the highest murder rates. At least 28 of them have a black population above the national 13.2% average. Most are SUBSTANTIALLY higher than that average. The top ten worst cities likely ALL are predominantly (at least a plurality) black. Yet no researcher wants to consider race — a verboten topic regarding violent crime. http://www.neighborhoodscout.c…..te-cities/ The countdown for the Top 30 Murder Capitals of America: Rank City 30 Baton Rouge, LA 29 Youngstown, OH 28 San Bernardino, CA 27 Oakland, CA 26 Barberton, OH 25 Poughkeepsie, NY 24 Cincinnati, OH 23 Petersburg, VA 22 Wilmington, DE 21 York, PA 20 East Palo Alto, CA 19 Jackson, MS 18 Wilkes-Barre, PA 17 Birmingham, AL 16 East Point, GA 15 East Chicago, IN 14 Compton, CA 13 Baltimore, MD 12 St. Louis, MO 11 Harvey, IL 10 Newark, NJ 9 New Orleans, LA 8 Trenton, NJ 7 Detroit, MI 6 Flint, MI 5 Saginaw, MI 4 Chester, PA 3 Gary, IN 2 Camden, NJ 1 East St. Louis, IL BTW, it’s likely that most of these cities have ‘strong’ gun control laws. And all but 1 or 2 are controlled by the Democrat Party. But, of course, correlation does not prove causation, yada, yada, yada. Sorry, Richard, but cities controlled by Democrats isn’t the reason for the high homicide rates in these cities. These cities are more concentrated with persons having well below a decent standard of living, be it housing, schools, jobs, etc., and thus are more concentrated with minorities who face discrimination than the rest of the country. With little opportunity and little hope, the matter of life is of less importance. Living in poverty isn’t conducive to living a good life. Living in poverty isn’t conducive to living a good life. I’m an immigrant from a country where the majority lived below the US poverty line. Yet, there was very little violence. Poverty does not cause violence. What causes violence is dysfunctional government and dysfunctional culture. more concentrated with minorities who face discrimination than the rest of the country You’re right that these minorities face discrimination and hopelessness. And who is responsible for that? The schools that educated them, the social programs that raised them, the employers that discriminate against them, and the bureaucracies and regulations that keep them in poverty: overwhelmingly controlled by Democrats. Democratic policies promote violence in minority communities around the country, largely because that serves the political interests of the Democrats, just like Democrats used to promote segregation, eugenics, and slavery. Democrats are always about dividing people up by race, it’s only the details that change over time. It’s utterly reprehensible. Just an aside regarding the 30 highest murder rate cities. I suspect all but a handful (at most) have tough gun control laws. And I’m pretty sure that, with perhaps 1 or 2 exceptions, all are Democrat controlled cities. But of course, correlation does not prove causation, yada-yada-yada. It’s impossible to know how often guns are used in self-defense, because defending yourself with a gun doesn’t always require pulling the trigger. You can even defend yourself with a gun over the phone: “I bought a gun so stay the hell away from me.” How can anyone measure that? “I bought a gun so stay the hell away from me” What if you only said that but actually you were lying and didn’t buy a gun or have one in the first place? Actually an interesting point. If we could not own guns, then THREATENING to have a gun would be ineffective. By villains not knowing who is armed and who isn’t, our right to own firearms helps defends those that chose NOT to own firearms. Without that uncertainty, we’d ALL be at greater risk. The height of stupidity is making a threat that you can’t back up. I can and will back it up. “I can and will back it up.” No doubt those clowns in Oregon were saying the same thing. Guns lend themselves to this kind of bravado. If you’re lucky you’ll just end up in jail like our friends in Oregon. I think it was Kleck’s study that tried to give some basic measurement. My memory says the number of DGUs where no shots were fired was over 90%. As I recall only about 8% of DGUs involved actually discharging the gun and only about 2% resulted in a room temperature intruder. Seems that when a potential victim turns out to be armed the majority of criminals suddenly remember they’re overdue at church choir practice … or something. Doherty is also spot-on about why such things are not reported to police. And of course the media isn’t interested unless there’s a body, blood or flashing lights. A good article in general, but I’m disappointed that you don’t call out the one absolutely uncontroversial *causal* connection between gun laws and violence: the kidnapping and caging of those that violate those laws. I know it’s kind of standard libertarian rhetoric to say that a gun law “bans” guns, but in fact it does no such thing: guns don’t listen to bans. What a gun law does is make a violent threat: “if you do X [buy a gun, sell a gun, possess a gun, etc], then we *will* commit a violent act against you.” Any calculation of violence with respect to gun laws *has* to take into account the number of people who will be/have been jailed as a consequence. The divergence in gun ownership polls is based on citizenship and voters. The two polls that show downward trending household ownership rates survey anybody, and the two that show relatively stable rates poll only registered voters. http://www.gunfacts.info/blog/polling-pollution/ I find it a curious omission that an article which includes such prominent placement for the work of John Lott ignores the even more significant efforts in this field performed by Mary Rosh. This article is well written & reasoned by Mr. Doherty. . I’ve been around the gun debate for years. Names like David Hemenway Philip Cook, Ludwig, Wintemute, Kellerman, Zimring, et al are familiar names in anti-gun “research”. The drumbeat from all these people is always negative about firearms with little acknowledgement that firearms MAY be useful to certain people. It seems that the above authors have almost always been shown to have been wrong. Whether by cherry-picking their data to support their ideology or failing to account for the simplest of variables. More interesting is to look up the source of their research dollars. I’ll let the reader do their own research, however I will tell them to expect to find most are funded by a few left-wing foundations. With crime rates falling over the last 20 years, the anti-gun left has been forced to adopt a position against a new scourge — “Gun Violence.” This allows them to lump together different activities other than violent crime and murder to bolster their statistics. Though it’s curious that they get away with including suicide as “gun violence.” That’s like including self-abuse (masturbation) under the heading of “domestic violence.” These are separate and distinctly different problems requiring different approaches. Yet the left wishes to treat them the same. And if you propose a solution for one issue and they dismiss it because it doesn’t solve both issues (only banning guns will “solve” it).

This is wha- I do…… ?????? http://www.buzznews99.com Re: “But perhaps, and more plausibly, these laws are more readily enacted in states where the prevalence of firearm ownership is low?there will be less opposition to them?and firearm ownership confounds the association.” Excellent. Re: “…since it’s always possible that those more likely to be suicidal are more likely to want to own guns.” I’d say it’s not just possible but probable. Men commit suicide at a rate four times higher than do women, and men are much more likely than women to want to own and in fact possess a gun. Don’t tell my wife that. She carries and she is a damn good shot. However, most women that commit suicide prefer other means such as sleeping pills. Suicide by gun is a messy affair. Women also have a lot more unsuccessful suicides than men, in fact they attempt suicide far more often. So, its NOT that those that are “more suicidal” are more likely to own guns…the opposite in fact. Men are just far more effective at carrying it out, as they use a more, uh, decisive method.

I work through this link, go to tech tab for work detail. _+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+ http://www.Homesalary10.com The paper didn’t look at gun statistics in the context of overall violent crime, a much more relevant measure to the policy debate. After all, if less gun crime doesn’t mean less crime overall?if criminals simply substitute other weapons or means when guns are less available?the benefit of the relevant gun laws is thrown into doubt. This, along with lumping in suicides, is why it is almost impossible to have a rational discussion on this topic. The goal should not be to reduce “gun deaths”, it should be to reduce overall deaths. People looking for simple solutions to complex problems view these as directly correlated data points, and conclude that reducing the former will automatically reduce the latter. It’s like suggesting grounding all airplanes will reduce travel deaths because no one will die in plane crashes anymore — ignoring that, in the absence of air travel, people won’t simply start sitting at home. If you look at the worldwide data on gun ownership rates, homicide rates, and suicide rates, there is no correlation between the first one and the last two, on a country-by-country basis. The goal should not be to reduce “gun deaths”, it should be to reduce overall deaths. But the actual agenda is to promote the progressive agenda. You see the same with the slicing and dicing of “mass shooters”: after you put mass murders committed by Muslims, mass murders committed by black gang members, mass members committed by Hispanic gang members, and mass murders committed by women (mostly poisoning) into separate categories (“terrorism”, “gang violence”, “domestic violence”), you are miraculously left with a high proportion of white male mass murderers. Then, progressives can go to work and attribute “terrorism”, “gang violence”, and mass murdering women to “white male privilege and oppression”, and voila, you have it: white males and their guns are responsible for everything that ails America. Progressivism and its use of reason and science are impressive, aren’t they? My last pay check was $9500 working 12 hours a week online.

It so happens that the 85% experiences significantly less gun violence, homicides and suicides since they have much less gun ownership largely due to restrictive gun laws.

Different countries and cultures have different homicide rates. That’s been true since colonial times. However, the simple fact is that gun violence in the US is almost entirely a problem of African Americans and Hispanics.

It so happens that the 85% experiences significantly less gun violence, homicides and suicides since they have much less gun ownership largely due to restrictive gun laws.

Is there a scientific consensus that it works? Thanks, but I think I’ll pass then. David Hemenway took to the pages of the Los Angeles Times to declare in a headline: “There’s scientific consensus on guns?and the NRA won’t like it.” Which only goes to illustrate again that “scientific consensus” and “scientific truth” are two unrelated concepts. Whenever someone starts using “science” and “consensus” in the same sentence, you are being had. Science is based on data and observation, not consensus. Appealing to consensus is merely a fallacious ad populum. Religion is based on consensus however. Did they just push an article from 2016 to the front page? Yeah, so what’s your point? “Despite the confident assertions of the gun controllers and decades of research, we still know astonishingly little about how guns actually function in society and almost nothing at all about whether gun control policies actually work as promised.” And that is fine, because none of it is relevant to the fact that the constitution says what it says. And no one tells a pollster the truth if they even talk to them at all. So all the polls on guns are as reliable as the ones that had what’s-her-name winning in a landslide.

427,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama-guns-idUSKBN0UI1UQ20160105,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Roberta Rampton, Ayesha Rascoe 5 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wiping back tears as he remembered children killed in a mass shooting, President Barack Obama on Tuesday ordered stricter gun rules that he can impose without Congress and urged American voters to reject pro-gun candidates. Obama made it clear he does not expect gun laws to change during his remaining year in office, but pledged to do what he can to make gun control a theme in the months leading up to the November election to replace him. In a powerful address in the White House, surrounded by family members of people killed in shootings, Obama’s voice rose to a yell as he said the constitutional rights of Americans to bear arms needed to be balanced by the right to worship, gather peacefully and live their lives. Obama has often said his toughest time in office was grappling with the December 2012 massacre of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. “Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,” Obama said, tears rolling down his cheek. “That changed me, that day,” he said, after being introduced by Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son was killed in the shooting. “My hope earnestly has been that it would change the country.” After that tragedy, the Democratic president failed to persuade Congress to toughen U.S. gun laws. He has blamed lawmakers for being in the thrall of the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby group. Related Coverage   Obama, comparing the issue to the great civil rights causes of his time, is set to discuss gun violence again during a live televised town hall on CNN on Thursday, and during his State of the Union address next Tuesday. Vice President Joe Biden is slated to do a series of television interviews on the topic on Wednesday. The U.S. Constitution’s 2nd Amendment gives Americans the right to have arms, a right that is fiercely defended. Obama laid out executive action he is taking to require more gun sellers to get licenses and more gun buyers to undergo background checks. Under the changes, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is issuing guidelines intended to narrow exceptions to a system that requires sellers to check with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether buyers have criminal records, are charged with crimes or have mental health conditions that would bar them from owning a gun. The proposal is “ripe for abuse” by the government, said Chris Cox, an official with the NRA, in a statement, adding that the group will continue to fight to protect Americans’ constitutional rights. Legal challenges to the changes, which are contained in guidance from the ATF, are expected. The crucial question in any direct legal challenge will be whether the ATF guidance creates new obligations, or merely clarifies existing law. The more the Obama administration acts as though the guidance has created a new legal requirement, the more legal trouble it might invite, said Lisa Heinzerling, administrative law professor at Georgetown University. The stocks of gunmakers Smith & Wesson Holding Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co Inc have climbed since the announcement. On Tuesday, Smith & Wesson ended up 11.1 percent to $25.86 a share and Sturm Ruger closed up 6.8 percent at $65.54. Republican leaders were quick to denounce Obama’s gun changes, with most Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential race promising to reverse his actions if they win the White House. Democratic candidates praised the moves. Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, said the changes were “all about burnishing the president’s legacy and boosting Democrat enthusiasm in a presidential election year.” Republicans who control Congress made it clear that they oppose the changes, although some downplayed their significance. “Ultimately, this executive ‘guidance’ is only a weak gesture - a shell of what the president actually wants,” said Kevin McCarthy, leader of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. Democrat Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia appeared to be in a minority in his party in voicing opposition to Obama’s actions. “Instead of taking unilateral executive action, the President should work with Congress and the American people, just as I’ve always done, to pass the proposals he announced today. “Like all law-abiding Americans and gun owners, I want to prevent future incidents of gun violence and keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, but legislation and consensus is the correct approach,” Manchin said in a statement.

Georgia State University provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list US President Barack Obama is taking aim at the so-called “gun-show loophole”. Obama’s most recent executive order on gun control attempts to clarify a distinction in federal firearms regulations between gun sales by businesses and guns sales by private individuals. Currently, federal law requires businesses that sell guns to possess a federal firearms license. That license demands that sellers do criminal background checks on anyone who purchases a gun from them. By contrast, the law leaves personal transactions unregulated. Is such a distinction warranted? Defenders insist that background checks on private firearm transfers – for example, between family members, collectors, and gun enthusiasts – would unduly burden the private ownership of firearms. Critics allege that the “loophole” is exploited to sell guns to people who couldn’t pass a federal background check. Polls reflect widespread support for universal background checks in the wake of recent mass shootings. This support exists among Democrats and Republicans. Even a majority of gun owners support it. But Congress has steadfastly refused to extend background checks to private gun sales. Lawmakers most recently refused to pass such a change in December just after the mass shooting in San Bernardino. The legislative process is intentionally designed to make it difficult to pass legislation over the strong opposition of a minority group. In this case, the  extreme wing of the NRA membership has the ear of key congressional players like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley whose support is necessary to advance legislation. The result has been legislative deadlock. Obama’s executive order is an attempt to bypass this legislative deadlock. The executive order has been carefully crafted to survive a court challenge. It does not erase the distinction between business and private firearms sales. Rather, it broadens the definition of a business and provides for stricter enforcement of restrictions on business sales by hiring additional personnel to conduct background checks. Yet, even the president has admitted that the executive order is “not going to prevent every mass shooting”. There is evidence that unregulated private sales – over the internet and at gun shows – are a source of guns for individuals who are ineligible to purchase or possess a firearm. However, the weapons used in recent mass shootings in San Bernardino and Umpqua Community College in Oregon were acquired legally at federally licensed gun stores or through private transactions that likely wouldn’t be affected by Obama’s new rules. In other words, the president’s executive order would not have stopped these shooters. The president’s executive order and its focus on the “gun-show loophole” is largely political theater. Act II will be his upcoming town hall meeting on CNN. Although these new rules might have a marginal effect on reducing illegal sales through a slight expansion of background checks for some sales previously considered private, it falls far short of gun-control advocates’ longstanding efforts to close the “loophole.” They want universal background checks, plus bans on high powered firearms, high capacity magazines, and armor-piercing ammunition. They also want mandatory gun owner liability insurance and federal funding for gun violence research. Other items in the executive order include modernization of processing operations for background checks, using the federal government’s purchasing power to push development of smart gun technology, and stricter requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns to federal authorities. Although Obama has taken center stage on this issue, presidential candidates of both parties are playing supporting roles. Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have called for closing the gun-show loophole, although neither has explained how they would make it happen. On the Republican side, candidates Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie have spuriously suggested that the president’s modest proposals to clarify and more vigorously enforce existing regulations would infringe on the Second Amendment right to own a firearm and represent an attack on private gun ownership. In the end, the president’s executive order is well within his powers to enforce the law, although given his inability to break the legislative stalemate over universal background checks, his powers to advance significant gun controls are extremely limited. Moreover, with over 350 million firearms already in private hands, even the most ambitious proposals to limit firearms sales are unlikely to end high profile massacres that have become increasingly routine in the US.

Obama to Take Executive Action on Gun Control — -- The executive actions on gun control under consideration by President Obama are within his legal authority, the president said today after a meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey and other U.S. law enforcement officials. “The good news is that these are not only recommendations that are well within my legal authority and the executive branch, but they’re also ones that the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners, support and believe in,” the president said following the meeting in the Oval Office today, though not providing details. He later added the proposals are also “entirely consistent with the Second Amendment and people’s lawful right to bear arms.” After October’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, President Obama asked his team to analyze what executive authority he could take on gun control, and he has said addressing ways to curb gun violence is part of his “New Year’s resolution” to complete unfinished business in the final year of his presidency. One option under consideration is expanding background check rules for people purchasing guns from dealers who sell a large quantity of firearms, including sales at gun shows and online, administration officials have said. The president will formally reveal his executive actions Tuesday. Despite not knowing the specific details of the plan, Republicans quickly criticized his imminent proposals. “I haven't seen them, but his first impulse is always to take rights away from law-abiding citizens, and it’s wrong. It's a pattern that's quite dangerous,” Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said on Fox News Sunday. House Speaker Paul Ryan accused the president of “subverting he legislative branch, and potentially overturning its will.” But Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders embraced the president’s pending executive actions. ""When I came out with my proposals for common sense gun safety measures, I did say that in the absence of congressional action, I would use executive authority to go as far as would be possible under the law and I applaud the president for taking a hard look at that,” Clinton said in Derry, New Hampshire, Sunday. Sanders said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” “I would prefer that we could have bipartisan support, but the truth is, Republicans are not interested in doing anything about gun safety. I think he's doing what the American people would like him to do.” In addition to his Tuesday speech outlining the plans, the president will participate in a one-hour live CNN town hall on gun control Thursday evening on the fifth anniversary of the shooting in Tucson, Arizona, of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. After his meeting with Lynch and Comey, the president lauded the recommendations provided to him by the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives today, but he acknowledged any executive orders won’t prevent all gun violence in the United States. “This is not going to solve every violent crime in this country. It’s not going to prevent every mass shooting. It’s not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal,” he said. “It will potentially save lives in this country and spare families the pain and the extraordinary loss that they’ve suffered as a consequence of a firearm being in the hands of wrong people.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2016-01-04 13:06:08,Obama Readies Executive Action on Gun Control,"politics and government,united states politics and government,gun control,firearms",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

The Response to President Obama's Executive Actions on Guns — -- President Obama unveiled several measures today intended to advance his gun safety agenda, saying he could not wait for an end to political gridlock to pursue efforts to reduce gun violence. ""The constant excuses for inaction no longer do. No longer suffice. That's why we're here today,"" Obama said as he addressed a room full of gun safety advocates and survivors of gun violence from the East Room of the White House. ""Not to debate the last mass shooting, but to do something to try to prevent the next one."" He added: “Until we have a Congress that’s in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence to save more lives."" Obama has said the deadly Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 was the worst day of his presidency. Today, he said that massacre and the many others demand urgent action. “Every time I think about those kids it gets me mad. And, by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day,” Obama said, his tears starting to flow. One of the measures he proposed clarifies an existing law that requires almost anyone who sells guns for a living to register as a firearms dealer and conduct background checks on clients. The president is also proposing new investments for mental health access, research into gun safety technology and additional Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents and investigators, although Congress would have to approve that funding. The executive actions on gun control under consideration by Obama are within his legal authority, the president said Monday after a meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey and other U.S. law enforcement officials. “The good news is that these are not only recommendations that are well within my legal authority and the executive branch, but they’re also ones that the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners, support and believe in,” the president said following the meeting in the Oval Office.

Obama Tears Up Recalling Victims of Mass Shooting — -- In a lengthy and emotional speech today, President Obama announced executive actions for “common sense” gun control. The measures include clarification of an existing law on background checks and gun dealer registration as well as new investments in mental health and gun safety research. Presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle reacted strongly to Obama’s demands. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton took to Twitter to applaud Obama’s plan. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders released a statement following the president’s announcement expressing his support. ""It's become clear that no mass shooting, no matter how big or bloody, will inspire Republicans to put children and innocent Americans over the interests of the NRA. They are simply more loyal to gun lobbyists than our children,” the statement reads. “That's why I support President Obama's executive actions to make our communities safer.” Sen. Marco Rubio said Obama is ""obsessed"" with ""undermining"" the second amendment. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, in an op-ed piece in Cedar Rapid’s newspaper, The Gazette, accused Obama of “trampling on the Second Amendment.” In the piece, Bush slammed Obama and Clinton for “[seizing] on every opportunity to advance a gun-grabbing agenda.” Bush vows to repeal the president’s executive orders “on Day One” if elected. Bush echoed his vow to repeal Obama's executive orders on Twitter. At a campaign rally in Iowa today, Sen. Ted Cruz dismissed Obama’s proposals as “not worth the paper they are printed on.” “When you live by the pen, you die by the pen and my pen has got an eraser,” he said. Cruz also took to Twitter to express his disapproval. Ben Carson argued on Twitter that Obama’s proposal will ""regulate"" freedom. He also accused the president of using the executive actions as a partisan tool. Carly Fiorina shared her reaction on Twitter just minutes before Obama’s announcement. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee used the president's plan to promote his pro-life agenda.

San Bernardino 911 Dispatcher Describes Handling Terror Attack — -- A San Bernardino, California, 911 dispatcher who helped direct the emergency response as terror unfolded during last month's mass shooting is headed to Washington, D.C., to attend President Obama's final State of the Union address on Tuesday. Annie Teall, a dispatcher who has been with the San Bernardino Police Department for 20 years, was the main dispatcher on Dec. 2 when two shooters unleashed an attack on the city's Inland Regional Center, San Bernardino police department spokeswoman Eileen Hards told ABC News. Teall is credited with remaining calm during the crisis that left 14 people dead, according to ABC station KABC-TV in Los Angeles.

South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley Delivers GOP Response — -- With the end of President Obama’s final State of the Union address, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sought in her Republican Party response to turn the page on his presidency and look towards the future -– one she said would be brighter under a Republican president. “Soon, the Obama presidency will end, and America will have the chance to turn in a new direction. That direction is what I want to talk about tonight,” she said, speaking from the capital city of Columbia. Haley said she understood that voters are frustrated with government, but added that Republicans must take some responsibility for that frustration as well as Democrats –- and channel it into meaningful action. “There is more than enough blame to go around. We as Republicans need to own that truth,” Haley, South Carolina’s first female, non-white governor, said. “We need to accept that we’ve played a role in how and why our government is broken. And then we need to fix it.” Haley, who noted that she is the daughter of immigrants, also sought to emphasize that the GOP is inclusive of all Americans, making what was perhaps a veiled reference to the more heated comments coming from some Republican candidates and lawmakers about Muslims and other immigrants. “Today, we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory. During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,” she said, speaking from the South Carolina statehouse. But she did note that Republicans do not believe in “flat out open[ing] our borders.” She also said that the United States shouldn’t admit any refugees with unclear intentions, which has led to some congressional Republicans effectively calling for a pause in the Obama administration’s program to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees. Haley, who gained national praise for her handling of the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Charleston church, said her party –- and all Americans -– should take a cue from how her state responded to the tragedy, noting that they embraced one another rather than assail each other’s race and religion. She also referenced the removal of the Confederate flag from near the statehouse –- a move Haley championed which earned her bipartisan praise nationwide. “We removed a symbol that was being used to divide us, and we found a strength that united us against a domestic terrorist and the hate that filled him,” she said, saying that action represents an important lesson. “Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference. That is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.” While her speech focused on the kind of party the GOP should strive to be, she also stressed the party’s chief principles, including strong Second Amendment rights, lower taxes and an end to the Affordable Care Act – the types of specific policies the Republican Party would pursue under new leadership. “As we usher in this new era, Republicans will stand up for our beliefs,” she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2016-01-12 20:04:03,Exceprts from Nikki Haley's Response to the State of the Union,"politics and government,united states politics and government,elections,labor,election issues",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Nowhere was her appeal to voters’ heads more evident than in arguing that Sanders’ single-payer health care plan is dangerous for Democrats to attempt to even pursue, given the battles it took to make Obamacare law. http://abcn.ws/1ZFLezF --DEBATE SPEED READ: ABC’s PAOLA CHAVEZ and JENNIFER HANSLER have more on the best lines of the night. http://abcn.ws/1U5EDrw and TOM THORNTON and ALI DUKAKIS boil down the debate in one minute. WATCH: http://abcn.ws/1JcoShV --ANALYSIS -- ABC’s RICK KLEIN: Has Donald Trump met his match in Ted Cruz? It’s not just the Iowa appeal that has that matchup dominating the Republican race two weeks before the caucuses. Consider how Cruz is handling Trump – and yes, it’s Cruz handling Trump, and not the other way around. Trump has been trying to draw him out for months with small and often veiled attacks. Cruz refused to engage. Then the birther buzz began, courtesy of Trump. Cruz found an opening for what may go down as the most effective attacks of the race: “New York values.” Cruz took his lumps for it. But he knows that being attacked by The New York Daily News, Bill de Blasio, and, especially, Hillary Clinton is a good thing in the Democratic primary. He’s now focused scrutiny on Trump’s past statements and positions – scrutiny he’s been able to avoid via his own bluster and media ubiquity until now. Cruz has vulnerabilities of his own, including some that are only just now surfacing. Trump is now unloading on a man he now calls “a nasty guy” whom “nobody likes.” Cruz is savvy enough to know what kind of words hurt, and what’s just noise. TODAY ON THE TRAIL with ABC’s SHUSHANNAH WALSHE:  In the morning Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley will participate and speak at the King Day at the Dome this morning in Columbia. Participants will march from Zion Baptist Church to the State House steps to honor Dr. Martin Luther King and to draw attention to present day economic equalities.Clinton will then travel to Toledo, Iowa where she holds an organizing event tonight. Sanders heads to Birmingham, Alabama where he tours civil rights landmarks and attends another MLK Day rally. And Martin O’Malley--who fought to get more time last night, but failed--spends the entire day in Columbia. Before the march he attends an MLK Day church service and this afternoon he speaks at a rotary club.  Donald Trump also has a two state day. This morning he speaks at the place it all started for Ted Cruz: Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. (Cruz announced his candidacy there back in March.) In the afternoon, Trump holds a rally in Concord, New Hampshire. Cruz is also  in NH holding a bus tour through the state. He’s making five stops starting in Keene this morning and ending in Whitefield tonight. John Kasich is also in New Hampshire.  Marco Rubio has a packed day in Iowa with four town halls and a meet and greet. He begins the day with an 8AM event in Decorah and ends with a 7pm stop in Bettendorf. Rand Paul, Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina and Rick Santorum are also in the state. Ben Carson, like the Democratic candidates, is in South Carolina today with a packed day. YESTERDAY ON THE TRAIL with ABC’s JENNIFER HANSLER, PAOLA CHAVEZ and VERONICA STRACQUALURSI SANDERS GOES AFTER CLINTON’S SPEAKING FEES. Bernie Sanders has drawn contrasts with Hillary Clinton on health care, paid family leave and Wall Street reform. During Sunday night’s Democratic debate in South Carolina, Sanders went one step further, launching arguably his most personal attacks of the former secretary of state yet, ABC’s MARYALICE PARKS and LIZ KREUTZ report. NBC’s Lester Holt asked the progressive what the biggest differences are between him and Clinton on the issue. “Well, the first difference is I don't take money from big banks. I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs,” Sanders responded. http://abcn.ws/208VwFe SANDERS ACCUSES CLINTON OF ‘DISINGENUOUS’ ATTACKS ON GUN CONTROL RECORD. The first policy question of Sunday’s debate here was aimed at Bernie Sanders’ complicated gun control record. The independent senator from Vermont, who often admits he is from a state with little gun control, defended his previous votes and argued he was better positioned to bring people together on the issue, ABC’s MARYALICE PARKS reports. “I think Secretary Clinton knows what she says is disingenuous,” Sander said during the NBC Democratic presidential debate. “I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I support what president Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loopholes.” http://abcn.ws/1WlDTA2 HILLARY CLINTON ACCUSES BERNIE SANDERS OF WANTING TO ‘TEAR UP’ OBAMACARE. At the Democratic presidential debate here tonight, Hillary Clinton just made the argument she and her campaign have been making over the past week to Bernie Sanders’ face. Her critique is that Sanders’ single-payer health care proposal would undo Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, and “start over again with a whole new debate.” ABC’s RICK KLEIN has more. http://abcn.ws/1RvbWGI SANDERS WON’T FULLY COMMIT TO CLOSING CONTROVERSIAL GUN CONTROL LOOPHOLE. Shortly before visiting Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston where nine people were killed last summer in a mass shooting, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would not fully commit his support to closing the so-called “Charleston loophole,” a gun control provision which allowed the accused shooter to purchase his gun. ABC’s MARYALICE PARKS explains more. http://abcn.ws/238enD5 MARCO RUBIO GOES ALL-IN ON GUNS FOLLOWING DEBATE. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio seems to be doubling down on gun control following the most recent Republican presidential debate. In New Hampshire on Friday, Rubio stopped by a gun store for a bit of retail politics. He later held a rally at Sturm, Ruger & Co., a firearms manufacturing company in Newport, where he was gifted a rifle. “My wife and I, we're gun owners,” he told the company’s employees. “This our first rifle in our home. It will be a nice addition.” According to ABC’s INES DE LA CUETARA, Rubio said they feared President Obama or his administration making it harder for ""law-abiding people like them"" to buy guns, something he also mentioned during Thursday's debate. http://abcn.ws/1KlalLR CLINTON ‘FLATTERED’ BY KARL ROVE ATTACK AD. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laughed off a new attack ad from a Republican super PAC run by Karl Rove during an interview Sunday on “This Week” with George Stephanopoulos. The web spot, titled “Hillary’s Bull Market,” was launched by American Crossroads, which is run by the Republican strategist and former President George W. Bush adviser. After watching the ad for the first time during her interview on “This Week,” Clinton just smiled.

Sanders Won't Fully Commit to Closing 'Charleston Loophole' CHARLESTON, South Carolina— -- Shortly before visiting Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston where nine people were killed last summer in a mass shooting, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would not fully commit his support to closing the so-called “Charleston loophole,” a gun control provision which allowed the accused shooter to purchase his gun. ""We are going to take a look at that as well,"" the presidential hopeful told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos Sunday on ""This Week."" ""But what is most important is that we have a strong instant background check. I have supported that from day one. At the end of the day, what almost every American understands is we have got to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. That has been my position since as far back and I can remember."" During the services at the church, the Jewish senator from Vermont bowed his head and prayed as a pastor intoned that ""we know that no place is safe."" The timing is especially significant to Sanders, as he battles back accusations from Hillary Clinton's campaign that he's soft on gun control. This weekend he announced his support for a bill that will roll back liability protection for gun manufacturers, though he has hesitated to support other measures like closing the so-called ""Charleston loophole."" The topic is sure to arise at the Democratic debate tonight, the final chance for candidates to square off before the Iowa caucuses. Last month in an email to supporters, Sanders said he was in favor of overturning the provision in the law that allows the sale of a gun to move forward if the federal government fails to return a background check in three days, as happened in the Charleston shooting. ""Congress should act to ensure the standard for ALL gun purchases is a completed background check. No check -- no sale,"" the email said. The alleged gunman, Dylann Roof, was able to purchase his gun after five days despite having a felony drug charge on his record, the FBI said last year. After he tried buying the gun, the background check missed that Roof had admitted to possessing drugs during a previous arrest, which should have barred him from completing the purchase. As the race for the Democratic nomination tightens, Clinton and Sanders have ramped up their attacks and rhetoric against each other. Speaking earlier on ""This Week,"" Clinton accused Sanders of flip-flopping on another gun control issue. The Vermont senator released a statement Saturday evening, on the eve of the next Democratic debate, saying he supported a new bill being circulated in Congress that would repeal the liability protections for gun manufacturers. ""I think the bill makes a lot of sense,"" said Sanders, who voted for the original law. ""What we will do is be supportive of this legislation."" He added, “There is an amendment though that I want to see incorporated into it ... which monitors the impact on gun shops in rural America.""

        Sapna Maheshwari Posted on January 5, 2016, at 6:43 p.m. ET Shares of gun manufacturers soared today as President Obama outlined a series of executive actions meant to expand background checks for firearm sales. Smith & Wesson rose 11% to close at $25.86, its highest closing price since it began trading more than a decade ago, while Sturm Ruger jumped 7% to $65.54. The broader S&P 500 rose just 0.2% for the day. Gun stocks tend to rally at any talk of gun control, which often serves as a catalyst for sales. Demand for firearms hit an all-time high in 2013 after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut — gun buyers became so convinced that a crackdown was approaching that the industry was hit by ""panic buying,"" as Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack put it on a conference call in 2014. ""Contrary to what common sense would seem to dictate, the data would suggest that a Democrat in the White House, and more specifically a Democrat campaigning to be in the White House, is very good for the gun industry, at least in the short run,"" analysts at Wedbush Securities wrote in an October note. ""Although Barack Obama has done nothing (at least so far) to advance the cause of gun control, he has been labeled the 'gun salesman of the decade,"" the analysts wrote at the time. Smith & Wesson raised its earnings forecast for the year ending April 30 on Monday night, citing higher than expected sales at its distributors and ""strong growth"" in background checks for December. Obama said on Friday that he was looking at measures to fight the nation's ""epidemic of gun violence"" in his last year in office. ""I believe in the Second Amendment. No matter how many times people try to twist my words. I taught constitutional law, I know a little bit about this,"" Obama said on Tuesday.

At the Democrats’ final debate before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, Clinton portrayed Sanders as a friend of the NRA and the gun rights lobby, noting their forum in Charleston was taking place just a block from the Emanuel AME Church where a mass shooting last year left nine worshipers dead. Sanders accused her of being “very disingenuous” about his record. They clashed not only over guns but also on health care, Wall Street regulation and campaign finance. The tone has gotten tougher and the attacks more personal since their first debate last fall, when Sanders had reassured Clinton he was “sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails” and the two shook hands. USA TODAY Clinton 'pleased' that Sanders 'reversed' position on gun issue Now, some Clinton partisans say she only belatedly has begun hammering the Vermont senator for proposing a health care program she argues would undo the Affordable Care Act. For his part, Sanders attacked the former secretary of State as beholden to Wall Street interests that have contributed millions to her candidacy, part of a “corrupt” campaign finance system that he says has contributed to growing economic inequality in America. He accused of her of spreading “nonsense” about the impact of his proposal for a single-payer health insurance plan that he calls “Medicare for all.” In some ways, the Democratic campaign is mirroring the Republican one. With a smaller field and two candidates now neck-and-neck in the early states, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz at the sixth GOP debate last Thursday dropped their unofficial non-aggression pact and began blasting one another on everything from Trump’s “New York values” to Cruz’s constitutional eligibility for the presidency. In the Democratic debate, sponsored by NBC and YouTube, Clinton was confident and in command of the details, especially when the topic turned to foreign policy. She repeatedly sought to tie herself to President Obama, who has a 90% approval rating among South Carolina Democrats. USA TODAY Fourth Democratic debate: Highlights from South Carolina USA TODAY Obama's biggest fan in South Carolina? Hillary Clinton But it was Sanders who seemed to be defining the agenda, calling for boldness on progressive causes while Clinton was more likely to cite what would be realistic. Energized and emotional, Sanders repeated his call for a “revolution” that would transform the country. Both claimed to be the stronger candidate in the general election. “We’re running ahead of Secretary Clinton in terms of taking on my good friend Donald Trump,” Sanders declared — citing polls, just as his good friend Donald Trump is prone to do. Clinton noted she had been the target of a new ad of a super PAC aligned with GOP strategist Karl Rove, which she has argued is a sign it assumes she’ll be the nominee. Also participating in the debate was former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, lagging in single digits and often struggling to break into the conversation. He pitched himself as “a new generation of leadership.” USA TODAY Martin O'Malley wants 'just 10 seconds' USA TODAY USA TODAY's 2016 Presidential Poll Tracker The latest polls in Iowa and New Hampshire show that it’s possible Sanders could beat onetime front-runner Clinton in both states, with repercussions on the rest of the primaries that are impossible to predict. In a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg News poll released last week, Clinton led Sanders among Iowa Democrats 42%-40%. In New Hampshire, the RealClearPolitics average of recent statewide polls put Sanders 6 points ahead. Two hours before the debate began, Sanders released details Clinton had demanded about how he would finance his health care proposal, including by a new tax on employers and households. On Saturday, he sought to defuse another line of attack by Clinton, announcing he would support legislation to remove liability protection for gun makers and dealers. That’s a reversal from his past position. Sanders argued that a single-payer system would work better and cost less than the Affordable Care Act. Clinton called the ACA “one of the great achievements of President Obama, of the Democratic Party and of our country.” The next time Clinton and Sanders meet face-to-face, their arguments and their appeal will have been tested not only by pollsters but also among voters. The next Democratic debate is set for two days after the New Hampshire primary, when the results of the first two contests may well have changed everything.",2016-01-17 00:00:00,"Analysis: Clinton, Sanders get personal as Democratic race tightens","politics and government,law and legislation,finances,united states politics and government,elections,medicine and health,presidents and presidency (us),presidential elections (us),primaries",4,http://www.usatoday.com

If the unthinkable Sandy Hook tragedy didn’t convince congressional lawmakers to tighten background checks on guns, what could? Jonathan Cohn sets out a case for how 2016 could create the atmosphere necessary in Washington for actual movement on new gun laws. Presidential campaigns focus public attention on policy choices and, on Election Day, they bring a broader, more representative slice of the public to the polls. That can create a political environment in which gun legislation can pass. It’s no coincidence that the Brady Bill, the last serious federal effort at reducing gun violence, passed one year after the 1992 elections -- following a campaign in which one candidate, Bill Clinton, took a strong stand in support of it. This election is likely to feature yet another Clinton taking yet another strong stand in favor of gun legislation. Whether she and the cause of new gun legislation prevail is, of course, an open question. It will depend on whether the supporters of legislation can, for a change, match the fervor of opponents. Obama knows this -- and appealed directly to supporters, practically begging them to vote against lawmakers and candidates who oppose gun legislation: “If you make it hard for them to block those laws, they’ll change course, I promise you.” It's worth noting here that the last gun vote that failed in the Democratically controlled Senate in 2013 included four votes from Democratic defectors, including Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska. Both men likely hoped the National Rifle Association would support their re-election bids based on that vote. Ha! No such luck. Both men were unseated the following year. So in the future, no congressional Democrat should have any illusions that voting the way the NRA wants them to will somehow insulate them from the NRA come election time. If it comes down to a decision between appeasing the NRA and doing what their constituents want or potentially what they believe is right in their heart (Begich was a one-time member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns), they might as well do the right thing.

In the wake of the Columbine High School massacre, Smith & Wesson, founded in 1852, cooperated with the Clinton administration in 2000 to install locking devices on firearms, develop “smart guns” that can only be fired by their owners, design weapons that block magazines holding more than 10 bullets and support background checks of all buyers. The company saw this as good PR and protection, perhaps, against lawsuits. But National Rifle Association didn’t see it that way and led a backlash by its members. The gun lobby accused S&W of an “an act of craven self-interest” in becoming “the first gunmaker to run up the white flag of surrender.” The NRA effort halved S&W’s sales and the company nearly went bankrupt. • Creep who harassed Sandy Hook victim’s family fired from university job: James Tracy, the Sandy Hook truther who allegedly harassed the family of one of the students killed in the 2012 mass shooting, has been fired from his position at Florida Atlantic University, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. Tracy came under fire after Lenny and Veronique Pozner, the parents of a boy who died in the massacre, published an op-ed in the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel alleging Tracy harassed them for proof that their son ever existed. • Salt miners in New York freed from stuck elevator. • Paris police kill knife-wielding man wearing fake explosive vest: Officials said the man shot to death Thursday wore a fake explosive vest and threatened officers at the entrance of a police station minutes after French president Francois Hollande, speaking in a different location, paid respects to officers fallen in the line of duty. Pierre-Henry Brandet, the Interior Ministry spokesman, said the man at the police station is believed to have cried out ""Allahu akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great."" He has not been identified, and Brandet told The Associated Press that police do not believe anyone else was involved. • A brief history of the Wilmingon coup d’etat and a few other anti-gov’t revolts: In November of 1898, a group of angry white supremacist Democrats marched on the city hall of Wilmington, North Carolina and seized control of the government, deposing the mixed-race Republican government. And here's the thing: It actually pretty much worked. The coup took place on November 10, two days after a vote restored the Democrats to power across the state. Before the vote, gangs of Democratic-affiliated ""Red Shirt"" thugs went around and terrorized black voters until they stayed away from the polls. The white supremacist leader, Col. Alfred Moore Waddell, publicly said that he would use black bodies to ""choke the current of the Cape Fear River"" before the election. • 7 kinds of gov’t subsidies those angry anti-gov’t ranchers get that you don’t. • On today’s Kagro in the Morning show, Greg Dworkin rounds up the day’s new v2.0 releases: Roy Moore, birtherism & Lochner.

At Juanita Jean’s of Texas, Susan DuQuesnay Bankston writes—Riddle Me This: Most of y’all know about Texas’ own Republican State Representative Debbie Riddle, our own version of The Church Lady, inventor of the whole terror baby thing, who thinks about transgender people way too much, who slept in the hall for three days so she could be the first to file an anti-immigrant bill, and has been known to give speeches at funeral homes Well, if you thought she was rightwing as could possibly be, you have another think coming from a lady named Valoree Swanson. Valoree is a Tea Party candidate running against Debbie in the GOP primary.  She has a website. Well, I guess a webpage would be more accurate since there’s only one page to it.  But she’s a star on Facebook, Honey. She calls her campaigning activities, “Liberty Blockwalks,”  and if you’re low on I Hate Hillary materials, she’s the one-stop shop for that. Honey, this woman is just one suitcase filled with snarks from heading to Oregon. But here’s the scary part. She’s obviously a shirt-swiper. At Blue Virginia, Lowell writes—VA House Majority Leader Kirk Cox (R) Leaves Virginia Supreme Court Justice Off His List and Out of His Prayers: When the Virginia General Assembly convenes next week for its 2016 session, the Republican majority of course plans to take up the most important, pressing issues facing Virginians -- expanding health care, protecting the environment, helping to create good-paying jobs, ensuring that every Virginian has a chance to succeed in life, etc. Oh wait, who am I fooling, of course that's not what they'll be focusing their time and energy on. Instead, they'll undoubtedly be looking at ways to screw over working people, the environment, people without access to affordable health care, etc., while rewarding big corporations and other monied interests. They'll also be busy pursuing grudges against Gov. McAuliffe, whether on his administration's plan for congestion pricing on I-66, or on Virginia Supreme Court Justice Jane Roush. With regard to Roush, see the Washington Post article from August 2015, which reports, ""Virginia Republicans say they will reject Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s pick for the state’s newest Supreme Court justice and install their own choice — an unprecedented move in modern Virginia history."" And why are Republicans doing this? Mostly because, as Jeff Schapiro wrote in November 2015, ""because [they] can...sticking it to McAuliffe, sheathing that delight in what passes for cynicism and providing another reminder that the governor, chastened in the General Assembly elections, has little or no pulling power in Virginia, a presidential battleground state he vows to deliver for Hillary Clinton next year."" This, despite the fact that Roush is currently on the Virginia Supreme Court, is by all accounts a superbly qualified Justice, and had strong bipartisan support … until Republicans decided to take a spiteful shot at Gov. McAuliffe. At Democratic Diva of Arizona, Donna writes—Ducey Appoints Notorious Anti-Public Education Figure to Az Supreme Court: Ugh, what a week. My brain is so crowded with things to be irate about I don’t even know where to start, but I’ll go with waking up Wednesday to learn that Governor Ducey had appointed Goldwater Institute litigator Clint Bolick to the state’s Supreme Court. Bolick has no experience as a judge but a long history of attacking public education and public workers, as detailed in the Montini column sneered at by Ducey’s communications director. And, hoo boy, does Bolick take a dim view of workers’ rights in general! Bolick has long been a huge “school choice” (privatization) proponent and a steadfast opponent of full public school funding. For years his Goldwater Institute has provided conservatives with fuzzy math-based inflated per-pupil spending amounts to enable them to obscure how much they have truly gutted public education. For example, here’s thehowler the Institute peddled about K-12 spending when they worked to defeat the Prop 204 sales tax measure in 2012 (emphasis mine): Arizona schools spend $9,233 per student when you add up all funding sources, a 9 percent increase from 2000. Such unusually high dollar figures (most surveys put Arizona substantially lower) are the result of GI including every expenditure they can get their hands on – “lunch money, after school sports, adult night programs, adjacent ways (sewer & road repairs as a result of city maintenance), and other non-revenue dollars” – which the other states we’re compared with do not use in their calculations. The bullshit-based defeat of Prop 204 cost the schools $1 billion. Of course, remember who else was a big Prop 204 opponent. I won’t speculate on whether the Bolick appointment was repayment or not. You decide. At Montana Cowgirl, Cowgirl writes—Montana Wingnut Who Says Slavery Never Happened Part Of Armed Takeover Of Government Offices In Oregon: A Montanan named Ryan Payne is among those showed up to do “whatever it takes” to defend the Steven and Dwight Hammond, who were convicted in 2012.  If Payne sounds familiar its might be because he also acted as the militia spokesperson at welfare rancherCliven Bundy’s armed standoff in 2014. And if you heard about this guy at all, its probably because Ted McDermott wrote a great expose on the underlying belief system driving Payne’s anti-government actions for the Missoula Independent after Payne showed up at the Bundy standoff in 2014: [H]e came to believe that slavery never really existed in the United States and that African Americans in the antebellum South “didn’t view themselves as slaves.” He came to believe in “an effort by some Jews to control the world.” He came to believe the founders of the United States intended for the states to act as sovereign countries. He came to believe taxes are a form of “legal plunder.” He came to believe names are spelled in all-caps on driver’s licenses because U.S. citizens are actually “corporate entities.” He came to believe U.S. courts are actually foreign admiralty courts. He came to believe that “in most states you have the lawful authority to kill a police officer that is unlawfully trying to arrest you.” He came to believe when a newborn child’s footprint is made on a birth certificate, that child is effectively entering a life of servitude to the U.S. government, which borrows money from China based on that child’s estimated lifetime earning potential. So next time you read about this bunch, or read nonsense like this on the matter, remember who these people are and what they stand for. At The Prairie Blog of North Dakota, Jim Fuglie writes—A Short (Well, Sort Of) Introduction to the Koch Brothers Influence in North Dakota: When I read about the Forum Communications Company hiring Rob Port as a regular columnist earlier this week, I thought “Well, there’s another blogger success story, making his move into the mainstream media.” For those of you not familiar with Rob Port, he’s the editor and owner ofSayAnythingBlog, a conservative political website based in Minot, ND. For the past few years he’s also been the North Dakota reporter for a website called Watchdog.org, a spinoff of the Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity. Don’t let the word “Integrity” in the name fool you. The Franklin Center (that link has waaaaay more information) takes a whole bunch of money from people like David and Charles Koch, the infamous Koch brothers—the ones who have  committed to spending $900 million to elect conservative candidates this year—and funnels it to right wing bloggers and independent newspapers in more than 40 states, including Rob Port in Minot, North Dakota. Its goal is to elect conservatives. They’ve been doing a pretty good job. Without much integrity. This week Rob and the Forum Communications Company announced that he will begin writing a weekly column in the company’s four North Dakota daily newspapers. At the same time, he says he has left the employ of the Franklin Center. At MN Progressive Project, Dan Burns writes—As Minnesota government goes green, where are the wingnuts? OK, there is actually a long way to go before Minnesota’s government can be seriously said to have “gone green.” But steps are being taken in the right direction, including: – A snazzy website devoted to climate change issues. It’s by the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board, which includes the heads of nine state agencies. The Minnesota Department of Administration’s (Admin) Green Fleet policies have been nationally recognized by the National Association of Fleet Administrators (NAFA). In its first ever accreditation of sustainable fleets, NAFA recognized 13 public entities from around the nation and Canada…   Governor Dayton committed state agencies to reducing their carbon footprint in Executive Order 11-13 by making their buildings and activities more sustainable and using clean energy resources. Since 2013 Admin’s Fleet Services has already reduced gasoline consumption by more than 16 percent through use of cleaner fuels and 94 percent of the fleet is now capable of operating with cleaner fuel. The department has increased overall fuel efficiency by adding 78 hybrid and six electric vehicles. Further, a telematics initiative is currently being piloted to provide greater data on vehicle use in order to design the most appropriately sized and efficiently managed fleet to meet agency needs.
(Minnesota Department of Administration) And I have yet to see wild howls of outrage, about any or all of the above, from right-wing legislators, or the state’s conservative politicos in general. Maybe I used the wrong search parameters when I went looking just now, but I don’t think so. So bashing this must not be seen as a political winner, at least for the time being. Of course, Minnesota produces neither coal nor oil, to speak of. But it’s still hard to believe that the righties plan to leave it alone indefinitely. Maybe the order hasn’t come down from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). At Bold Nebraska, Jane Kleeb writes—Bold Nebraska Statement on TransCanada Suing U.S. Government Over Rejection of its Keystone XL Pipeline: Bold Nebraska issued the following statements today in response to TransCanada’s announcement that it will file a claim under NAFTA to try to recoup a supposed $15 billion loss it suffered when the U.S. government rejected its Keystone XL pipeline project. The company also separately filed a lawsuit in U.S. federal court that claims it was unconstitutional for the President to reject the foreign company’s risky tarsands pipeline. “The rejection of Keystone XL was justified in order to protect the land, water and property rights of farmers and ranchers. This desperate attempt by TransCanada is a move to show their shareholders they have a viable project when they have hit a dead end,” said Jane Kleeb, Bold Nebraska director. “TransCanada’s latest action reminds me of a spoiled kid who refuses to take “no” for an answer,” said Nebraska farmer Art Tanderup, whose land was in the path of the rejected pipeline. “The President said “no” and now they are going to sue. A foreign corporation is suing the United States because they were not allowed to push their poison through the heartland with no concern for the land, the water and the people who live here.” “This action by TransCanada says that they are not serious about building the pipeline. Why sue if they are still planning on building? To me, this is good news. TransCanada bullies landowners, they bully the states, and now they’re bullying the Federal Government,” said Paul Seamans, South Dakota landowner. At ColoradoPols, Colorado Pols writes—Morgan Carroll Makes Guns an Aurora Issue​: We don’t post all of the blast emails we get from political candidates, but we wanted to take a moment to highlight a very smart action alert sent out yesterday by Democratic CD-6 candidate Morgan Carroll, in response to President Barack Obama’s executive actions to tighten background checks for gun sales: I remember the horrific day the Aurora movie theater mass shooting happened. My house was five minutes away from the theater itself. For me, that was it — enough was enough. [Pols emphasis] With the help of Captain Mark Kelly — husband of Gabby Giffords — I fought hard to propose and eventually pass universal background checks on gun purchases in Colorado… The moment to step up and speak louder and bolder about gun safety in our country comes today on the heels of President Obama’s executive action. We’ve endured tragedy after tragedy, and we can’t just wave the white flag on gun violence. In 2013, Sen. Carroll was a sponsor of House Bill 1229, the law requiring background checks for most transfers of guns in our state. That law on the books means Colorado already does more to require background checks than anything Obama ordered yesterday–or for that matter has the power to do without congressional action. The hard-fought passage of this law is a big reason why Colorado lawmakers were in attendance at the White House yesterday, including the two Colorado state senators who were ousted in gun lobby-organized recalls of 2013. At Ohio Daily, Anastasia Pantsios writes—Kasich Has Performed an Education Miracle Equal to his Economic Miracle! Well, isn’t this special? Happy New Year, everyone! We're about to make you so glad John Kasich is our governor — NOT. Yeah, he's still missing in action reportedly last seen in a small town in New Hampshire. But he’s left behind a nice parting gift for Ohioans: “Ohio Schools Slide in National Rankings: Achievement gap widens between rich and poor students” Our miraculous governor is working more miracles! Six years after ranking fifth in the nation, Ohio’s education system has tumbled to 23rd among the 50 states and District of Columbia, according to a national report card released on Wednesday. Hmmm…. Let me think. Who was governor six years ago? Oh yeah, that alleged “failure” Ted Strickland. At Bleeding Heartland of Iowa, desmoinesdem writes—16 Iowa politics predictions for 2016: Hoping to improve on my percentages from last year, I offer sixteen Iowa politics predictions for 2016. Please spin your own scenarios in this thread. I finally gave up on trying to predict whether Governor Terry Branstad will still be in office at the end of the year. Although his close adviser David Roederer ""emphatically"" says Branstad will serve out his sixth term, I am convinced the governor will resign early. But I can’t decide whether that will happen shortly after the November 2016 election or shortly after the Iowa legislature’s 2017 session. 1. Turnout for the Iowa Democratic caucuses will be below 150,000. Nearly 240,000 people showed up for the 2008 Democratic caucuses, obliterating the previous record of 125,000 caucus-goers set in 2004. The three Democratic campaigns are all running extensive field operations, and Bernie Sanders is drawing phenomenal crowds all over the state, but I just don’t see turnout reaching anything close to the level of eight years ago. One thing makes me second-guess this prediction: a person who has already attended a precinct caucus is way more likely to do so again. With staff and volunteers for Hillary Clinton, Sanders, and Martin O’Malley scouring the lists of Iowans who caucused in 2008, they may be able to produce bigger numbers than I expect. However, I am going with my gut. At The Political Environment of Wisconsin, James Rowen writes—Special interest WI bulldozer finds more real estate targets: The Journal Sentinel gives page one coverage today to a move in the Wisconsin Legislature to allow property owners to tear up Native American effigy mounds: Landowners could excavate and possibly develop some of the surviving Indian mounds of Wisconsin — many dating back more than a millennium—under legislation by two lawmakers. The bill from Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Rep. Robert Brooks (R-Saukville) would shift the balance of state law more toward private property rights and away from the preservation of one of the state's unusual features. I noted this breathtaking and arrogant outrage in mid-December, and added cultural context, here, with a reminder that Walker & Co. were eager to excavate the Bad River tribal watershed for 35 years of open-pit, mountain-top-acid-runoff producing iron ore mining while also using state power to make it easier for local schools to retain mascots and nicknames Native Americans found offensive. That GOP legislators—and, of course, the builders and WMC have already signed on—would even broach the bulldozing of effigy, burial grounds should take no one by surprise, given the ruling party's inclination to sell off, deregulate or diminish public and common assets—groundwater, shorelines, wetlands, lake and stream access,clean air, and state lands. At Raging Chicken Press of Pennsylvania, Sean Kitchen writes—Wanna Kill Medical Marijuana In Pennsylvania? Sink It with 197 Amendments: It appears that the Pennsylvania House is a black hole.  It is a place where sensible policy goes to die, and it’s latest legislative victim appears to be Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana law, Senate Bill 3. Since November, House Republicans have attached most of the 197 amendments to the bill, which have been obtained by the Raging Chicken Press. Throughout 2015, we have covered the medical marijuana issue and the roadblocks impeding the legislation.  The bill was stalled in the House Health Committee which is chaired by State Representative Matt Baker, who has received tens of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical companies.  The bill sat in Baker’s committee until there was a confrontation between House Speaker Mike Turzai and Majority Leader David Reed over bill.  It was reported that Mike Turzai left the caucus meeting in inaudible tearsbecause David Reed wanted to bring the bill up for a vote in the House Rules Committee and send it to the floor. When the bill made it out of committee, it was bogged down with close to 100 amendments.  One of the amendments in particular would limit treatment for those suffering from PTSD to military veterans who were in active combat; excluding those who suffered from sexual or traumatic abuse or other life altering experiences that would bring the onset of PTSD.  That amendment is still attached to the bill.",2016-01-09 15:01:17,This week at progressive state blogs: PA tries to ditch medical weed; the Kochs' juice in ND,"politics and government,finances,medicine and health,labor",115,http://www.dailykos.com
444,http://feeds.dailykos.com/~r/dailykos/index/~3/CajzrptltoM/-America-s-long-sad-history-of-school-shootings,"When we think of school killings, we usually think of recent events, like the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 children (mostly first- and second-graders) and six adults. Or the 1999 shootings in Littleton, Colorado, where students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold terrorized their classmates and teachers at Columbine High School, killing 13 and wounding 20. The many killings on or near college campuses, from the shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 that killed 32 and wounded 17, to the attack near the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2014 that killed six and injured 14, to the shootings at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, in 2015 that killed nine and hurt nine more. The list goes on and on. The sad fact is that the United States, awash with guns throughout its existence, has a troubled history of school killings—by far more than any other country. The motivations behind modern shootings can be murky, and the lack of action on how to stop them remains frustrating. The vast majority of shooters (although not all) were white and male. Most acted alone, and by the second half of the 20th century, these shooters carried at least two weapons. About half of the shooters were students. Many incidents early in the country’s history involved one or two victims, often settling a personal grievance. Modern shootings, especially after weaponry grew more sophisticated, were more likely to claim multiple lives, although the mass shootings described as “rampage” shootings still remain rare. According to research conducted by the Academy for Critical Incident Analysis at John Jay College of Criminal Justice about school shootings and reported in a blog called The Media Transformation, 85 percent of shooters had a history of being bullied. It’s also possible that many perpetrators had some form of mental illness. The motives for some killers may never be known, as more than 70 percent of the shooters kill themselves shortly afterward. Today, January 17, is the 27th anniversary of the Cleveland Elementary School massacre in Stockton, California, which was the first mass shooting of schoolchildren in U.S. history. It became the impetus for important state and federal legislation to curb gun violence, plus a presidential executive order against assault weapons. Five children were killed, and 29 children and one teacher were injured. All of the fatally shot victims and most of the wounded were Cambodian and Vietnamese immigrants. All but one of those killed were offspring of Cambodian refugees who had survived the Khmer Rouge. Some 71 percent of the school’s population was made up of war refugees. And the shooter had a special hatred of Asians, whom he believed were taking American jobs. Patrick Edward Purdy had a troubled childhood that included drug and alcohol addiction, stints in foster care, and homelessness. He also had a long criminal record: He spent time in prison for armed robbery, illegal weapons sales, and several drug crimes. While in prison, he apparently became a devotee of white supremacy. During one of his many arrests, he was carrying a book about the Aryan Nation and told the county sheriff that it was “his duty to help the suppressed and overthrow the oppressor.” On the morning of January 17, 1989, Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton received a phone call with an anonymous death threat. At about noon, Purdy drove to the school and parked his van, which was filled with fireworks, behind the school. He then set it on fire with a Molotov cocktail. The children were playing outside during their lunch break. Purdy started shooting randomly into the playground from behind a portable building. In three minutes, Purdy fired 106 rounds from an AK-47, killing the five children and wounding the others. He then shot himself in the head with a pistol. Purdy wore a flak jacket that bore the words “PLO,” “Libya,” and “death to the Great Satin” [sic]. Purdy also had carved the words “freedom,” “victory,” “Earthman,” and “Hezbollah” on his rifle. After the shooting, his co-workers said he had a special hatred for Asians, claiming that they had taken jobs from “native-born Americans.” Purdy had attended Cleveland Elementary School 16 years earlier. The five children who lost their lives at Cleveland Elementary School on January 17, 1989, were Oeun Lim, Ram Chum, Rathanan Or, Thuy Tran, and Sokhim An. They ranged from 6 to 9 years old. The horrific shooting became national news. “Why could Purdy, an alcoholic who had been arrested for such offenses as selling weapons and attempted robbery, walk into a gun shop in Sandy, Oregon, and leave with an AK-47 under his arm?” Time magazine asked at the time, according to Cleveland School Remembers, a private organization run by survivors of the shooting that now works against gun violence. Although Purdy had a criminal record, he hadn’t been convicted of a crime that prevented him from buying a gun. Nor had he been diagnosed as mentally ill. The Stockton shooting became the incentive to pass a state ban on assault weapons in 1989 in California and a federal ban on assault weapons in 1994. It also motivated President George H.W. Bush to sign an executive order in July 1989 banning the importation of foreign-made semi-automatic assault rifles in an effort to limit their availability in U.S. markets. Imagine that! An executive order banning assault rifles by a Republican president! The guy was obviously a dictator. That 1994 assault weapons ban was in effect for 10 years but expired in 2004 when Congress failed to extend it. A 2004 Justice Department study found that “the use of assault weapons in crime declined by more than two-thirds by about nine years after 1994 Assault Weapons Ban took effect,” although the study said the full results were mixed. We all know what happened after that—assault weapons sales skyrocketed. The AR-15, the weapon used at Sandy Hook, has been described by The New York Times as “the most wanted gun in America.” In some cases, demand for assault weapons has outpaced production. There’s no way to reach an accurate account of school shootings over the history of the country. Wikipedia, using multiple sources of historical newspaper reports and research studies, estimates that there have been more than 370 school shootings in the United States during its history. Its list excludes incidents during wars or police actions, and murder-suicides by rejected suitors or estranged spouses. Most of the shootings resulted in at least one death or injury. Other compilations give different totals. The Academy for Critical Incident Analysis at John Jay College of Criminal Justice reports 294 attempted or actual school killings with at least two victims over 250 years in the U.S. and 37 other countries. Those researchers also compiled figures of recent mass school shootings in 36 countries and found that the U.S., with 10 percent of the combined population of the other countries, had nearly as many killings as the rest of the countries combined. In a nation of 319 million people with an estimated 300 million guns, it’s not surprising that the U.S. far surpassed every other country with its number of school shootings. The first mass U.S. school shooting was at a college campus on August 1, 1966, when a sniper in a bell tower at the University of Texas at Austin killed 16 people and wounded 32 others in a 96-minute shooting spree. The shooter was Charles Whitman, an engineering student at the University of Texas and a former Marine who had won sharpshooting medals. Whitman fired randomly at targets from the 28th-floor observation deck of the bell tower. He was armed with two rifles, a sawed-off shotgun, a pistol, a revolver, and 700 rounds of ammunition in a footlocker. Whitman, who had a history of mental health issues but was also bitter about his Marine service after he was court-martialed for gambling, was finally shot and killed by an Austin police officer. Many historians suggest that the random killing from high above on a university campus in what was essentially the country’s first mass shooting in a public area ended Americans’ feelings of safety in public places. Since the Sandy Hook shooting, sources have quibbled over the exact number of school shootings and what actually defines such an incident. Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group dedicated to “understanding and reducing gun violence in America,” keeps track of school shooting numbers and puts the current total at 160 school shootings since 2013, or an average of one per week. On the low end is the Washington Post, which argues that some of those cases, such as suicides or accidents, shouldn’t be included, and puts the figure much lower — 35 cases similar to Sandy Hook (as if that’s not 35 cases too many of dead children or teens). There have been school killings in other countries, too. For instance, in 2011, a 23-year-old former student returned to his elementary school in Rio de Janeiro and started firing, killing 12 children and seriously wounding more than a dozen others, before shooting himself in the head—the worst school shooting Brazil has ever experienced. Also not included in the totals are terrorist attacks or attacks during war that took place at a school, or in which children were killed. But nothing matches the pace set by shooters in the U.S. While there are statistics, a cursory search doesn’t turn up much research into the causes of school shootings per se. Those who favor gun rights and those seeking legislation against gun violence have both been accused of cherry-picking facts to suit their causes. One thorough study is by Katherine Newman, a nationally recognized sociologist who has taught at Columbia, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and Princeton universities and is now provost of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She has written books on school violence and led a research team in a two-year study of rampage school shootings. That study was published as Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shootings in 2004 (more about the book here). She explained her study in layman’s terms in a CNN opinion piece published shortly after the Sandy Hook shooting, first noting that “small towns like Newtown are where 60 percent of rampage school shootings in the United States occur.” We spent several months in Kentucky and Arkansas, in two towns that had been the scenes of shootings in the late 1990s. We interviewed the shooters' neighbors, friends, instructors, coaches, and Sunday school teachers. We talked to people who had observed the shooters in jail cells right after the shootings, and years later in prison. We combed the records of every shooting of this kind in the U.S. from the 1970s onward, looking for patterns. And while each tragedy has its own anatomy, a picture emerged that makes sociological sense and probably has some bearing on the Newtown case. Rampage shootings are never spontaneous. They are planned, often for months in advance. We don't know yet whether the Newtown shooter, Adam Lanza, gave any warnings, but in the episodes we studied, shooters commonly told their peers — often in a veiled and ambiguous fashion — what they had in mind. One reason shooters tip their hands is that they are trying to solve a problem. Though they are often intelligent, high-performing boys, their peers tend to see them as unattractive losers, weak and unmanly. In a school culture that values sports prowess over academic accomplishment, they face rejection. The shooters are rarely loners, but tend instead to be failed joiners, and their daily social experience is full of friction. Since they are almost always mentally or emotionally ill, those rejections — so common in adolescence — take on greater importance and become a fixation. Rebuffed after trying to join friendship groups, they look for ways to gain attention, to reverse their damaged identities. The shooting is the last act in a long drama: a search for acceptance and recognition. The earlier acts fail miserably. But once a shooter starts to talk about killing people, ostracism can turn to inclusion. Newman says gun safety laws or “anything that thwarts the efforts … to get their hands on guns will make it harder to perpetrate a massacre and will deter the ambivalent.” She adds, however, that gun safety laws are not enough, that “a determined person will find a way … That is why gun control is a necessary but not sufficient step.” Although we will not be able to stop all of these tragedies, we can cut down on their number by ensuring that adults make themselves available to kids in completely confidential settings, reassuring them of their privacy when they take that risky step to come forward. … In the end, though, there will be troubled boys, and some of them will become killers. To the extent that we can capture the warning signals they send out to their peers, we can do our best to stop them in their tracks, even if we do not always succeed. In his last year in office, President Obama has decided to take some limited executive actions against gun violence. Specifically, he is ordering universal background checks in gun sales, including those at gun shows; he is seeking increased funding for mental health care, and making sure the background check system includes information about mental health care; and he is ordering the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research about gun safety technology. These actions should be no-brainers. Many of these proposals have been endorsed in past years by members of both parties and the National Rifle Association, and are backed by a two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans and gun owners, according to a CNN survey taken after Obama announced his actions. But the false Republican and NRA meme now continues to be nothing but “Obama will take your guns,” just as it has been throughout his two terms. Obama has called the Sandy Hook shooting “the worst day of my presidency.” The Sunday after the shooting, before speaking to a group in Newtown, he spent time with the families of the victims, comforting parents and playing with siblings too young to understand. The President’s Devotional: The Daily Readings That Inspired President Obama, by Joshua DuBois, gives an account of those meetings. DuBois accompanied Obama to Newtown in his role as White House spiritual adviser. … The president took a deep breath and steeled himself, and went into the first classroom. And what happened next I’ll never forget. Person after person received an engulfing hug from our commander in chief. He’d say, “Tell me about your son. … Tell me about your daughter,” and then hold pictures of the lost beloved as their parents described favorite foods, television shows, and the sound of their laughter. For the younger siblings of those who had passed away — many of them two, three, or four years old, too young to understand it all — the president would grab them and toss them, laughing, up into the air, and then hand them a box of White House M&M’s, which were always kept close at hand. In each room, I saw his eyes water, but he did not break. And then the entire scene would repeat — for hours. Over and over and over again, through well over a hundred relatives of the fallen, each one equally broken, wrecked by the loss. After each classroom, we would go back into those fluorescent hallways and walk through the names of the coming families, and then the president would dive back in, like a soldier returning to a tour of duty in a worthy but wearing war. We spent what felt like a lifetime in those classrooms, and every single person received the same tender treatment. The same hugs. The same looks, directly in their eyes … Most of us will never understand how deep within himself Obama had to reach to comfort those grieving families. It’s no wonder that speaking of those killings causes him to tear up. On a televised CNN town hall meeting days after announcing his executive actions, Obama shared that the meetings in Newtown were the only time he had ever seen Secret Service agents cry. Only a heartless bastard would dare to question whether Obama’s reaction was real. And speaking of heartless bastards, the crew at Fox News reached a new low (as if that were possible) when some suggested that his tears weren’t real, or that he must have had a raw onion at the podium to produce tears. Wrote New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristoff: “President Obama shed tears on Tuesday as he called for new gun safety measures, and some critics perceived weakness or wimpishness. Really? On the contrary, we should all be in tears.”",2016-01-17 11:01:18,"America's long, sad history of school shootings","drug abuse and traffic,crime and criminals,children and youth,murders and attempted murders,homeless persons",115,http://www.dailykos.com

After high-profile mass shootings, President Barack Obama has urged the American people to call on Congress to pass measures that would restrict access to guns and, hopefully, reduce gun violence. But after multiple pleas, Congress hasn't acted, even after the grisly mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012. So Obama is now acting on his own — with executive actions. ""Every single year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns,"" Obama said at a press conference on Tuesday. ""We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency."" Obama met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to consider what he can do without congressional legislation to reduce gun violence in America, which kills many more people in the US than other developed nations. In a press conference after the meeting, White House officials announced a plan they had been working on for months behind the scenes to address gun violence. The changes attempt to tighten — but don't close — what's widely (but misleadingly) known as the ""gun show loophole,"" as well as increase the efficiency of the federal background check system to avoid cases from falling through. The executive actions will also take smaller steps, ranging from improving the tracking of lost or stolen guns to encouraging technological improvements that will, in theory, make firearms safer. This would not be the first time Obama has taken executive action on guns. In 2013, after Congress failed to pass gun control legislation following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Obama signed 23 executive actions and then a few follow-up actions that generally tightened the background check system. But Obama's latest actions appear to be the boldest, touching on one of the longest-running issues with federal gun control laws and a broader hot-button debate about what to do about America's extraordinary levels of gun violence. There are risks to Obama acting without congressional approval. Critics of the administration have already suggested that they will challenge new executive actions in court. Not getting legislation in the books also means that a President Ted Cruz (or Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, and so on) could unilaterally reverse Obama's actions. Shortly before the announcement of the plan, a congressional Republican also threatened to block funding for the Justice Department to stop the executive actions. The Obama administration has pushed on anyway, arguing in an email, ""The president has made clear the most impactful way to address the crisis of gun violence in our country is for Congress to pass some common sense gun safety measures. But the president has also said he's fully aware of the unfortunate political realities in this Congress. That is why he has asked his team to scrub existing legal authorities to see if there's any additional action we can take administratively."" Obama is also taking his call for more actions to the American people: On Thursday, he's participating in a CNN town hall about guns. Here's what the Obama administration plans to do: In addition to these measures, the administration will continue pushing Congress to pass tighter gun control laws, and to direct more funds to enforcing existing gun laws and to mental health treatment.  Obama's executive actions are a small but significant tweak to existing laws. In the US, there are several restrictions in federal law to buying a gun. Generally, the idea is that Americans who are underage, have serious criminal backgrounds, or are mentally ill should not be able to purchase a firearm. Whether someone falls into any of these categories is typically evaluated through a background check: Under the federal system, licensed dealers are required to run these checks before they can sell someone a gun, typically by having the FBI check a person's criminal record, mental health history, and other factors. If someone fails a background check, he or she can't legally buy a gun. But the system is riddled with loopholes. The most well-known way to bypass background checks is the private sales loophole: If someone purchases a gun from a private seller, such as a friend or family member, no gun background check is required. This is often mischaracterized as the ""gun show loophole,"" under the assumption that people can simply go to a gun show and buy a gun without getting a background check. But licensed dealers at gun shows still have to carry out a background check. The actual loophole is that someone can meet with a private seller at a gun show — or, increasingly, over the internet — and buy a firearm from that person without a background check. In other words, the gun show doesn't create a loophole; the private sale does. An equally big problem is that the system of background checks is notoriously underfunded, understaffed, and underresourced. Although there are no waiting periods under federal law, a check that turns out inconclusive can be extended for three business days. But these three days are a maximum for the government — and sometimes the three days lapse without the FBI completing its check, and a buyer can at that point purchase a gun without the completed check. The FBI admitted that something like this happened with the shooter who killed nine people at a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015: That shooter should have failed a background check for a handgun purchase after admitting to illegally possessing controlled substances in the past, but the FBI examiner did not obtain the shooter's record in time. The federal background check system also largely relies on states' reports, including some data for mental health history and criminal records. Since states have their own budget issues to deal with, or may simply ideologically oppose the idea of background checks, states' noncompliance can create yet another way the system can fail to stop someone who shouldn't buy a gun from obtaining one. (State laws treat guns in a wide variety of ways; Slate has a good rundown of the differences.) Obama's executive actions don't completely close any of these loopholes and faults in existing law, including the ""gun show loophole,"" but they do take steps to tighten current restrictions on firearms and ensure that federal officials can actually enforce the law that's on the books. Following the mass shooting in Sandy Hook Elementary School in which a gunman killed 20 children, six adults, and himself, Congress was pressured to pass a bill that would have tightened the private sales loophole and potentially taken other steps toward restricting access to guns. But negotiations over the bill eventually fell apart, leading Obama to act on his own. It can be difficult to understand how the US hasn't done much to combat gun violence for years. America is unique not just in terms of gun violence but in terms of gun ownership — the country has by far the highest rates of gun ownership in the world. The research clearly shows that more guns mean more gun violence, so all those guns are leading to more deaths. And the public widely supports closing the loopholes in the law. Yet even with this research and public support, and despite thousands of mass shootings during Obama's time in office, Congress has decided not to act. The reasons for this are complicated, but they're generally rooted in America's strong gun culture and the powerful lobby behind that culture. The single most powerful political organization when it comes to guns is, undoubtedly, the National Rifle Association, which has an enormous stranglehold over conservative politics in America. Anytime there's an attempt to impose new forms of gun control, the NRA rallies gun owners and other opponents of gun control to kill such proposals. These gun owners make up a minority of the population: anywhere from 34 to 43 percent of households, depending on which survey one uses. But that population is a large and active enough constituency, particularly within the Republican base, to make many legislators fear that a poor grade from the NRA will end their careers. As a result, conservative media and politicians take the NRA's support — especially the coveted A-to-F ratings the organization gives out — very, very seriously. Sometimes politicians will go to absurd lengths to show their support for gun rights. For example, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) last year starred in a video, from IJ Review, in which he cooked bacon with — this is not a joke — a machine gun.  Although several campaigns have popped up over the years to try to counteract the NRA, none has come close to capturing the kind of influential hold that the organization has. Some of the groups — such as StopTheNRA.com, in part funded by Democratic donor Ken Lerer — didn't even last a few years. Kristin Goss, author of The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know, said this might be changing. She argued that newer gun control groups like Everytown for Gun Safety and Americans for Responsible Solutions are much more organized, are better funded, and have more grassroots support than gun control groups have had in her 20 years covering this issue. As a result, Democrats at the state and federal level seem much more willing to discuss gun control. But supporters of gun control face a huge obstacle: far more passionate opponents. As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000, ""The question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their 'control' position?"" Probably not, Norquist suggested, ""but for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this."" What's behind that passion? Goss, who's also a political scientist at Duke University, suggested it's a sense of tangible loss — gun owners feel like the government is going to take their guns and rights. In comparison, gun control advocates are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence — although, Goss noted, the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun to put a face on these policies by engaging more actively in advocacy work, which could make the gun control movement feel more relatable. There is an exception at the state level, where legislatures have passed laws imposing (and relaxing) restrictions on guns. In 2014, for instance, Washington state and Oregon passed laws ensuring all guns have to go through background checks, including those sold between individuals. ""There's a lot more going on than Congress,"" Goss said. ""In blue states, gun laws are getting stricter. And in red states, in some cases, the gun laws are getting looser."" Still, the NRA's influence and its army of supporters push many of America's legislators, particularly at the federal level and red states, away from gun control measures — even though some countries that passed these policies have seen a lot of success with them. From Obama's perspective, that forced him to act alone to get something done on guns. Javier Zarracina/Vox Although Obama's executive action will help slightly restrict access to guns, it won't come anywhere close to bringing levels of gun violence down to the levels of other developed countries. Neither would the Senate bill that ultimately failed. The reason for that is simple: The problem is, fundamentally, that the US has a lot of guns, so any measure that doesn't significantly reduce the number of guns will ultimately fall short of fully addressing violence. The research on this is very clear. Reviews of the evidence by the Harvard School of Public Health's Injury Control Research Center have concluded that more guns lead to more gun violence. Other factors, such as socioeconomic issues, obviously contribute to violence, but guns are the one issue that makes America unique relative to other developed countries in comparable socioeconomic circumstances. Take, for instance, this chart, from a 2007 study by Harvard researchers, showing the correlation between statewide firearm homicide victimization rates and household gun ownership after controlling for robbery rates: A more recent study from 2013, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, reached similar conclusions: After controlling for multiple variables, the study found that a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level. This holds up around the world. As Vox's Zack Beauchamp explained, a breakthrough analysis in the 1990s by UC Berkeley's Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not, contrary to the old conventional wisdom, have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations. Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that's driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. ""A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,"" Zimring and Hawkins wrote. ""A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London."" How can the country address this? The research shows tightening existing gun control measures in the US would help. But as Harvard's David Hemenway told Vox's Dylan Matthews, it would likely take decades for the mild gun control measures proposed in the US to have a significant impact. ""It's all speculation,"" Hemenway said. ""I suspect it would take a while (decades) for the US to get down to gun violence levels of other developed countries because a) we have so many guns which are durable, and b) we have a gun culture — we tend to use guns more often in more situations than citizens of other developed countries."" To have a more immediate impact, then, the US would have to find a way to quickly remove the number of guns in circulation. Other countries have actually done that: In Australia, after a 1996 mass shooting, lawmakers passed new restrictions on guns and imposed a mandatory buyback program that essentially confiscated people's guns, seizing at least 650,000 firearms. According to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers, Australia's firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent. Although it's hard to gauge how much of this was driven by the buyback program, researchers argue it likely played some role: ""First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates."" Still, similar measures would be very difficult to pass in America, due to the strength of gun culture and the gun lobby in the US — pushing Obama to act without Congress with a much smaller policy tweak.

Republicans have selected Nikki Haley, currently serving her second term as governor of South Carolina, to deliver their official response to President Obama’s last State of the Union address in office. The State of the Union response has long served as a national platform to showcase a rising star in the opposition party. During Obama’s time in office, young Republican responders have included Paul Ryan, who is now speaker of the House, and Marco Rubio, a contender for the party’s presidential nomination. Party elders first noticed Haley when in 2010 she rode a wave of Tea Party popularity past several better-known Republican contenders to the governor’s mansion, becoming the state’s first woman and nonwhite governor. At 43, she is also the nation’s youngest governor. Her national profile grew dramatically this past summer when, following the mass shooting at a historically black church in Charleston, she shepherded a law through the state legislature to remove the confederate flag from the state capitol, displaying a deft ability to unite both parties on a deeply fractious issue. Since then, her name has been floated as a possible vice presidential pick for the eventual Republican nominee. She represents a particularly savvy pick because, in recent years, parties have sought to choose responders who conveniently also demonstrate racial and gender diversity in their party. As an Indian-American woman, Haley lends the GOP a much-needed diverse perspective in a field that’s often perceived as largely white and male. But demographics alone do not a future national leader make. Haley, who was elected governor of South Carolina in 2010 at the height of Tea Party influence, has long demonstrated an anti-establishment streak, the ideological flavor du jour with Republican voters. That tendency stretches far back in her political career. While serving in the South Carolina House of Representatives, Haley forced a fight over the way the chamber recorded votes. She wanted every vote to be on the record, meaning each politician would voice a ""yea"" or ""nay"" rather than a simple voice vote. The move made her deeply unpopular with House Republican colleagues — most politicians dislike on-the-record voting because it provides opponents more fodder to fault their voting records — and party leadership stripped her of a powerful committee assignment. It was on a record of government accountability that Haley announced her bid for the governor’s mansion in 2010, challenging party bigwigs including a US representative, the state’s lieutenant governor, and the attorney general. She was polling last among the four Republican candidates until, three weeks before the primary contest, Sarah Palin threw her support behind Haley in a surprise endorsement that boosted her Tea Party credibility. Palin’s support put Haley over the edge: She won the Republican primary race in a runoff election and went on to beat the Democratic challenger, Vincent Sheheen. Soon after taking office, Haley signed a bill into law requiring all legislative votes to be on the record, fulfilling a core campaign promise. Ironically, not long after, she also became the subject of several state ethics inquiries. In one inquiry that went to the state’s Supreme Court, investigators accused her of breaking ethics codes by accepting donations from a payday lending company while sitting on a House committee charged with payday lending reform. She was cleared of wrongdoing, because it is legal in South Carolina to accept donations from companies that have relevant bills pending before the legislature. Her national image bruised by these and other scandals, Haley focused much of her energy on boosting signature Tea Party issues popular at home. She pushed steep cuts to the state budget and created more charter schools and school vouchers. Her moves to curb regulation and limit lawsuits, in particular, even made her a more popular figure among business-minded establishment Republicans. She also gained notoriety for outspoken opposition to numerous Obama administration policies — stances that earned her coveted spots on national Sunday talk shows. She refused to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act and signed an Arizona-style immigration law forcing officers to report anyone they discover who might not be an American citizen. She testified against the National Labor Relations Board at a congressional oversight committee, which had sued Boeing for relocating to South Carolina, a state where employees cannot be compelled to join unions. And this year, after the shooting in San Bernardino, California, she joined two dozen other governors in declaring that their states would not accept Syrian refugees. For all that’s been made of Haley’s popularity nationally, the governor has not attempted to make inroads with the different factions of her party in South Carolina – let alone reach out to the opposing party. Haley has a famously poor relationship with the state legislature, one that began with her accountability fight as a House member and dogged her into her governorship. Since her first term, the governor has been known to create report cards on lawmakers in the state legislature, documenting whether they voted with her on a broad set of issues. ""Don’t forget their names and let them know you expect them to reverse course,"" she wrote in a Facebook post accompanying a list of lawmakers with whom she was disappointed. ""No excuses."" She also appears unwilling to collaborate with legislators when asked. In one recent example, Haley and the legislature agreed to craft a bill to repair roads in the state after the chair of Michelin North America threatened to halt expansion in the state if they weren’t fixed. Both parties agreed to address the issue, and the legislature created a special committee that worked with the governor’s office to put together a package. They were all taken aback when, soon after, Haley released her own plan, which tacked on a steep decrease in the state’s income tax, and publicly chastised any lawmaker who refused to back it. Haley made the fight on the road bill and several other issues her singular focus in a speech to the state Republican Party’s convention in May, calling out the names of a short list of lawmakers who had voted her way on every issue. It was a state of fraying relations so dire it attracted brief national attention. Less than a year before South Carolina was due to host its early presidential primary contest, critics thought Haley should have taken a more national outlook. But the tussle was quickly forgotten when in June a white gunman went on a shooting spree at Emanuel AME Church, a historically black church in Charleston, killing nine parishioners — including the church’s senior pastor, state Sen. Clementa C. Pinckney.  From left: Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), Gov. Nikki Haley (R-SC), Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), Rep. and former Gov. Mark Sanford (R-SC), and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Despite her position as the state’s first minority governor, Haley never displayed an interest in removing the flag from state grounds before the Charleston massacre. In 2014, during a gubernatorial debate, Haley defended the flag against rivals who argued it should be taken down. ""What I can tell you is over the last three and a half years, I spent a lot of my days on the phones with CEOs and recruiting jobs to this state,"" she said. ""I can honestly say I have not had one conversation with a single CEO about the Confederate flag."" But after it came to light that the Charleston shooter was an avowed white supremacist, posing for unsmiling photographs with the rebel flag, Haley publicly changed her mind. Her sudden turnabout demonstrated the political potency of the events in Charleston, a racial event so powerful it provided a once-unthinkable opening to discuss the flag as a racist symbol. But it also showed Haley’s political savvy, in facing national calls to remove the flag and understanding the repercussions of inaction, to overcome elements in her own party that viewed the flag issue as a sideshow. Indeed, a bill to remove the flag from the state’s capitol stalled in the state legislature for several weeks, with opponents offering extraneous amendments to slow its progress from one chamber to the next and finally to the governor’s desk. But the bill ultimately passed both the Senate and House with huge majorities in favor, and on July 9 Haley signed a bill to take down the flag. ""Now there's more reason to come to this state,"" Haley told CNN after the signing ceremony. ""I am proud to say that it's a new day in South Carolina."" By becoming the face of the flag’s removal, Haley enjoyed a level of national praise – from Republicans and Democrats alike – that she had not seen since first winning office in 2010. She’s also shored up popularity in the state with more than half of the state’s voters approving of the job she’s doing. Though her five intervening years were colored by disagreement and controversy, her unwavering leadership following the massacre in Charleston eclipsed any earlier shortcomings. Her initiative helped not only her own image but that of her entire party, which is likely why Republican leaders want her to become its newest face. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

448,http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-tears-of-despair-and-defiance?mbid=rss,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By John Cassidy For advocates of greater gun-control measures, the buildup to Tuesday's announcement by President Obama of a series of administrative measures designed to prevent gun violence, including expanded background checks for gun sales, wasn't promising. In a New York Times report that previewed the new policy moves, an official from the National Rifle Association was quoted as saying, ""This is it, really? This is what they have been hyping for how long now?"" On Wall Street, stock prices for gun manufacturers, such as Smith & Wesson, rose, evidently reflecting a belief that the new policies wouldn't hurt sales, and might even boost them. Despite this dismissive attitude from the gun lobby and investors, the event, which took place in the East Room of the White House, turned out to be a memorable one. At turns scornful, hopeful, and angry, Obama delivered an emotional peroration on the issue that has perhaps frustrated him more than any other. Toward the end, recalling the massacre three years ago at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, he cried openly, and was forced to gather himself. Perhaps the speech wasn't the greatest that the President has delivered, but it was among the most direct and heartfelt. At the very least, it should lay to rest portrayals of him as a cold and distant figure, a Mr. Spock in the Oval Office. This was Obama with his humanity, and his despair, all too visible. But it was also a defiant Obama—a President who had decided that in his last months in office he would do what he could, even as he knew that it wouldn’t be enough. Appearing before an audience that included Gabby Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman who was gravely wounded during a mass shooting in Tucson in 2011, the President was introduced by Mark Barden, whose son, Daniel, was shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Recalling his initial meeting with Barden, which took place shortly after the December, 2012, massacre, Obama said quietly, ""That changed me, that day, and my hope, earnestly, has been that it would change the country."" Obama's hopes, and the hopes of the entire gun-control movement, were to be disappointed, of course. Acknowledging that he’d been defeated in his efforts to overcome the gun lobby after Newtown, the President didn't try to oversell his new proposals, which are modest and sensible measures that Congress should have approved years ago. They include expanding the definition of ""gun dealer,"" so that more people buying guns online, or at a gun show, have to undergo a background check; allowing the background-check system to access information about a prospective buyer’s mental health; providing more resources to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and sponsoring research into ""smart"" guns, which can be tracked and disarmed remotely. As he often does, Obama gave the impression that he was bemused by the opposition to such simple, potentially life-saving measures. He cited evidence from Connecticut and Missouri to support his case that requiring background checks can have an impact on gun deaths. He mentioned polling data showing that the vast majority of Americans support mandatory background checks, as do a majority of Republicans, and even a majority of N.R.A. supporters. Pointing to the Republicans' refusal, in the wake of the attack last month in San Bernardino, California, to approve a law that would have prevented people on the federal no-fly list from buying firearms, he said, simply, ""That's not right. That can't be right."" In the first part of his speech, Obama kept it together. He was playing his usual role as the most reasonable man in the room, twinning an appeal to reason with some basic morality. Quoting Martin Luther King, Jr., he referred to ""the fierce urgency of now, because people are dying."" But when the President turned to the larger theme of why America can't come to terms with the conflicting interests, and conflicting rights that the gun issue presents, the moment and the memories of past shootings started getting to him. ""Second Amendment rights are important, but there are other rights that we care about as well,"" he said, citing the right to worship freely and safely that was ""denied to Christians in Charleston, South Carolina; and that was denied Jews in Kansas City; and that was denied Muslims in Chapel Hill; and Sikhs in Oak Creek. They had rights, too."" ""Our right to peaceful assembly, that right was robbed from moviegoers in Aurora and Lafayette,"" Obama went on. ""Our unalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, those rights were stripped from college kids in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara, and from high schoolers in Columbine, and from first graders in Newtown."" At this second mention of Newtown, the President started to tear up, and he had to stop for a few seconds. ""First graders,"" he repeated, trying to steady himself. It didn't work. After resuming his speech for a sentence, he stopped again, this time for longer. He wiped away a tear, this one from below his left eye, and then he pressed his lips with his thumb and forefinger. Finally, he spoke. ""Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,"" he said, gesticulating with his index finger and brushing away another tear, this one from below his right eye. ""And, by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day."" Seeing the President's display of emotion, the crowd applauded, which gave him a bit more time to pull himself together. ""So,"" he went on, the wetness on his face still clearly visible, ""all of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies. All of us need to stand up and protect its citizens. All of us need to demand governors and legislators and businesses do their part to make our communities safer."" The denunciation of the N.R.A., which went unnamed in this part of the speech, seemed to rouse the President and get him back on track for the climax of his speech. The best way to defeat the gun lobby, he insisted, was at the polls. ""And, yes, it will be hard and it won't happen overnight,"" he said. ""It won't happen during this Congress. It won't happen during my Presidency. But a lot of things don't happen overnight. A woman's right to vote didn't happen overnight. The liberation of African-Americans didn't happen overnight. L.G.B.T. rights, that was decades' worth of work. So, just because it's hard, that's no excuse not to try."" Obama was only being realistic about the prospects for further progress. He was also serving notice for those who agree with him. In addition to shedding tears of despair, they will need to shed some tears of defiance. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

449,http://www.rawstory.com/2016/01/obama-administration-releases-order-for-more-background-checks-on-gun-buyers/,"The White House unveiled gun control measures on Monday that require more gun sellers to get licenses and more gun buyers to undergo background checks, moves President Barack Obama said were well within his authority to implement without congressional approval. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives now will require that people who sell guns at stores, at gun shows or over the Internet be licensed and conduct checks, officials said. The ATF was finalizing a rule requiring background checks for buyers of dangerous weapons from a trust, corporation or other legal entity as well. Obama, speaking to reporters before the measures were made public, said they were consistent with the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms. ""These are not only recommendations that are well within my legal authority and the executive branch, but they’re also ones that the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners, support,"" Obama said during a meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other advisers. Obama is igniting a political firestorm by bypassing Congress with the measures, which could spark legal challenges. Republicans say Obama is misusing his powers. Shares in gun makers Smith & Wesson Holding Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co Inc rose against a falling stock market on Monday in anticipation of increased gun sales, as has happened before when the White House mulled weapon sales reform. Stymied by Congress' inaction on gun control, the president asked his advisers in recent months to examine new ways he could use his executive authority to tighten gun rules unilaterally after multiple mass shootings generated outrage nationwide. The White House had drafted a proposal on licenses previously but was concerned it could be challenged in court and hard to enforce. Guns are a potent issue in U.S. politics. The National Rifle Association, the top U.S. gun rights group, is feared and respected in Washington for its ability to mobilize gun owners. Congress has not approved major gun-control legislation since the 1990s. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the administration did not have an estimate of the number of people who would be affected by the changes. She did not set out a numerical threshold for dealers, telling reporters on a conference call that people selling one or two guns at a flea market could considered be dealers. But she said hobbyists and collectors would still be exempt from registration requirements. Obama said the measures would not prevent every mass shooting or violent crime, but they did have the potential to save lives. The president is scheduled to give remarks about gun control at 11:40 a.m. EST (1640 GMT) on Tuesday. 'EXECUTIVE OVERREACH,' RYAN SAYS The president's use of executive action launches his final year with a move that Republicans say exemplifies misuse of his powers. Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, rejected Obama's proposals for legislation to tighten gun rules in 2013. ""The president is at minimum subverting the legislative branch, and potentially overturning its will,"" Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan said in a statement before the White House announcement. Republicans have called for more focus on mental health care rather than measures to restrict gun ownership. The White House said it would ask Congress for $500 million in its 2017 budget to boost access to mental health care. U.S. states have taken their own approaches to addressing gun violence. Texas legalized openly carrying handguns, while New York and Connecticut have banned high-capacity magazines. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the rights of individual Americans to keep and bear arms. But the court also recognized that laws imposing conditions on commercial guns sale can be consistent with the Second Amendment. (Reporting by Roberta Rampton and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Ayesha Rascoe, Julia Edwards and Robert Iafolla; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Cynthia Osterman) MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell speculated this week that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will resign on the morning of August 13. Lindell told Real America's Voice host Steve Bannon that he came to this conclusion after speaking with three Democrats who regretted voting for Biden. The MyPillow CEO claimed that he had convinced the Biden voters that the 2020 election had been stolen from former President Donald Trump.         Florida Republicans now want to replicate the humiliation seen in Arizona as members of the party there searched for ""bamboo fibers"" in ballots. A state Rep. Anthony Sabatini (R) falsely claims that ""audits"" in Arizona and Georgia turned up ""irregularities"" in the 2020 election and is using that lie to justify a so-called ""forensic audit"" on the five largest counties in Florida. That would include targeting Broward, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Orange counties.       Appearing on CNN with host Poppy Harlow, former Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA) stated he was pleased that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) added Republican Reps. Liz Cheney (WY) and Adam Kinzinger (IL) to the House select committee investigating the Jan 6th insurrection -- and then he  had some tips for the Democratic leader on how to undermine House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's attacks on the committee. Dent -- a Republican who counts himself as a ""never Trumper"" -- said Pelosi has tools at her disposal that will waylay any complaints from McCarthy about the lack of Republicans on the committee.

450,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/OB93KVy20Oc/,"Even in an increasingly nichified media landscape, firearms magazines stand apart. Let’s get one thing straight: Guns & Ammo is not not a political magazine. Political debate is inextricable from gun culture in America. But Guns & Ammo, which has been in circulation since 1958, is a technology publication, arguably primarily so, and one that embodies much of the look and feel of American publications devoted to gadgetry over time. Guns & Ammo’s do-it-yourself ethos, a foundational value among gun owners, also evokes the spirit of magazines like Science and Invention, a tech monthly popular in the 1920s that taught readers how to build their own fireworks, radios, hubcaps, clocks, and other devices. Humans aren’t the star of Guns & Ammo, so they’re rarely featured on the cover. (When the talk-radio host Dana Loesch appeared on the cover, in June, she was the first woman to appear there since 1961.) Instead, usually, the cover image is of a gun. And many of the rest of the magazine’s pages look the same: filled with sleek, smooth, powerful machines. Guns, yes, but disassociated from consequence, often just floating on the page as though it’s a catalogue. In broader narratives about guns—pretty much any time they’re mentioned in a mainstream newspaper—firearms are depicted as murder weapons. But in Guns & Ammo, they are first and foremost tools for hunting, devices for the protection of human life, historical artifacts, and works of art. In the world of Guns & Ammo, guns are not a problem to be solved; they’re a technology to be adored. Actually, in the beginning, Guns & Ammo wasn’t just about appealing to gun enthusiasts, but was one piece of a larger strategy to reach a desirable demographic of readers at a time when the magazine industry was thriving. Guns & Ammo was part of a portfolio of magazines, all published by Robert Petersen, that also included Hot Rod, Motor Trend, Motor Life, Car Craft, Hot Rod Cartoons, and Skin Diver. By 1981, his magazines had a combined circulation of about 4 million readers, most of them male and “action-oriented,” as The New York Times once put it. That number wasn’t exactly huge for the time, compared with mainstream magazines—National Geographic alone had more than 1.3 million subscribers at the time—but Petersen’s success showed there was a real appetite for niche publications. In Petersen’s era, the special-interest magazine genre grew explosively. (Although going back to the 18th century, America has seen periods of expansion and contraction among special-interest publications. The Internet age has ushered in its own phase of unprecedented nicheness.) It wasn’t long after Guns & Ammo was founded that popular mass magazines began to lose momentum, as niche magazines—particularly those pertaining to fishing, hunting, and mechanics—made significant strides. David E. Sumner, in his book, The Magazine Century: American Magazines Since 1900​, says that these trends may have been prompted by the rise of television. TV helped expose audiences to new ideas, places, and hobbies, which buoyed those same audiences’ interest in publications like Guns & Ammo. Petersen knew how to cater to tap into huge audiences of potential readers. He may have been fixated on cars and guns, but he also founded Teen magazine, aimed at preteen girls. Petersen, who died in 2007, apparently knew when to get out of print. He sold his company for $450 million in 1996, at a time when the web was poised to decimate the publishing industry. Today, Guns & Ammo is owned by InterMedia Outdoor Holdings, which runs several other shooting and hunting publications like Gun Dog, Peterson's Bowhunting, Wildfowl, Bowhunter, Handguns, Rifleshooter, Shooting Times, Firearms News, and several others. (Guns & Ammo didn’t respond to my request for an interview.) “My main takeaway is that these are all essentially car magazines,” Justin Peters wrote for Slate in 2013, in a review of Guns & Ammo, Handguns, and Rifle Firepower. “They feature money shots of various guns, plenty of product reviews, and geeky, unbridled enthusiasm for their subject matter. They rarely stray into politics. If you don’t own a gun, there’s no real reason for you to read them.” The look of the magazine is the reason Guns & Ammo has broadly the same feel as Macworld magazine, or Personal Computing, or Creative Computing—only instead of pages filled with images of monitors and keyboards, there are colorful close-ups of Glocks and silencers. But I disagree with Peters that politics rarely comes up. Politics is implicit in cover-story headlines (“Ready to fight”) and explicit in the “politics” section of the Guns & Ammo website. (Other dedicated categories include “shoot 101,” “ammo,” “gear,” “personal defense,” “survival,” “military & law enforcement,” and “suppressors.”) Politics are also, it seems, a contributing force to the magazine’s longevity. As many other print-era special-interest publications have folded, Guns & Ammo has, so far, lasted—maybe even thrived. Today it has 378,000 print subscribers, according to its parent company, more than half the number of weekday print subscribers to The New York Times (about 625,000). Which means Guns & Ammo has a relatively large audience for a special-interest magazine. Maybe that’s because guns aren’t really “special interest” in the United States, a country where there are some 350 million firearms and 320 million people. Other gun magazines have had similar successes. In 2013, Ad Week called them a “beacon of hope for the American publishing industry”: American Rifleman and America’s 1st Freedom, both of which are benefits of NRA membership, saw their circulations increase 14 percent to 1.9 million and 8 percent to 545,019, respectively, in the first half of the year versus the year-ago period. Handguns and Guns & Ammo, published by InterMedia Outdoors, saw their circ jump 16 percent to 137,648 and 7 percent to 416,224, respectively. That’s the other thing. Guns & Ammo isn’t the only gun magazine out there, though it may be the best known. The sheer volume of titles available represents a “remarkably specialized” slice of the larger gun world, says Robert Spitzer, the chair of the political-science department at SUNY Cortland, and the author of five books about gun policy. For example, Spitzer sent me an incomplete list of the magazines he saw, in print, at a grocery store in upstate New York this week: If the popularity of these magazines correlates with gun ownership, they’re also linked to what some gun owners perceive as a growing threat to their rights. Guns & Ammo’s ad revenue has swelled in recent years. Its print ad pages grew 3 percent in 2013, according to Ad Age, during a period of time when industry ad pages overall declined 0.5 percent. In 2012, the year of the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, Guns & Ammo’s ad pages “climbed a whopping 20 percent,” Ad Age said. “Traditionally, these magazines do better when gun owners feel their rights are being threatened,” Steve Cohn, editor-in-chief of Media Industry Newsletter, told Ad Age in 2014. (Though it’s still worth noting that, as with most print publications, its print subscriptions have declined.) Which brings us back to politics, the undercurrent in American culture that sets these special-interest publications apart—and perhaps buoys them at a time when other legacy publications have crumbled. (It’s not as though they lack online competition: There are countless Reddit threads and other independent websites devoted to firearms.) “All of these publications [are] now are infused with gun politics to some degree,” Spitzer told me in an email. “The NRA wouldn’t have it any other way.” In recent years, several gun journalists have been fired for being perceived as too soft on Second Amendment rights. One high profile incident, in 2013, resulted in the ousting of Dick Metcalf, a journalist who had written about guns for nearly four decades. Metcalf had written a column in which he suggested some regulation of firearms might be okay. (“The fact is,” Metcalf had written, “all constitutional rights are regulated.”) “The backlash from Second Amendment Fundamentalists—and I used to think I was one of them—was immediate,” Metcalf later wrote in a column for Politico about what had happened. “The hijacking of our movement by these radical extremists causes me to fear for the future of the right I have spent my adult life fighting to defend.” The shift that Metcalf perceived has to do in part with forces outside of Guns & Ammo, or even the larger debate over gun regulations. The nichification of media, the extent to which special-interest communities are now everywhere online, arguably has had a segregating effect whereby likeminded people congregate, and tolerance for (or even exposure to) different points of view is diminished. (Eli Pariser wrote a book, The Filter Bubble, about this phenomenon.) Which, in a way, means more publications and publishing platforms are becoming more like Guns & Ammo: special-interest spaces where people seek affirmation of their existing values, and who are infrequently challenged to reconsider. Whether Guns & Ammo is a tech magazine or a politics magazine ends up being, to its readers and non-readers alike, meaningless. People on either side of the guns debate aren’t coming together anyway. “I think it's an unbridgeable gap, because neither side will trust the other,” Metcalf said at the Aspen Ideas Festival in 2014. “I'm afraid I'm not optimistic in the aftermath of what happened to me.” And anyway. It’s a place for guns, not for debate. The magazine, that is. But probably the country, too.

(Composed by Caroline and edited, with reader comments, by Chris.) The Final Sprint to the Iowa Caucuses First of all, what’s a caucus? Priscilla explains. On the brink of the election’s opening contest two days from now, candidates began their closing arguments. On Monday, the three Dem candidates participated in a town-hall forum, while on Thursday, the GOP candidates (minus Trump) met on the debate stage for the last time before voting begins. A reader notes: “Turns out the donations Trump claimed go directly to vets don’t go to vets at all, but to his personal foundation!” Another reader, Jim Elliott, digs deeper: According to Forbes, between 2009 and 2013, the Donald J. Trump Foundation distributed $5.5 million to 298 charities. That’s an average of $18,456 per charity. Which, normally, would be fine—micro-targeting non-profits for specific projects is pretty much how foundations roll. During that time, $57,000 went to seven veterans’ organizations, an average of $8,142.86 per group Also, according to The Daily Caller, Trump gave at least $100,000 of his own money to the Clinton Foundation during that time frame. Trump is known, in charitable giving circles, as the “0.00013% man.” As in, that’s how much of his wealth he donates annually, making him among the most miserly of rich people in the U.S. Given Trump’s continued ability to divide Republicans, David Frum wondered if the GOP elites will finally let go of some their cherished policies. And David Graham examined how “Sanders, like Trump, is a threat pointed directly at the party establishment.” Elsewhere in politics, in case you missed: Molly on why Capitol Hill hates Ted Cruz—and whether he can “use that to convince America to love him.” Russell on how Sanders could make history for Jews if he wins IA or NH. Michelle on how all the aspiring first spouses have yet to be scrutinized. Ta-Nehisi with a followup on his piece challenging Sanders over reparations. (Conor defended the Vermont senator’s stance.) Ta-Nehisi then responded to Kevin Drum’s criticism while readers started a discussion thread on reparations. ​Looking abroad: Heather Horn on Merkel’s controversial refugee policy. (Edward covered the Danish reaction to its refugee crisis.) A reader commented on Merkel: It seem odd that introducing higher levels of criminality and a population that lacks the language and job skills to meaningfully contribute to German society is described as “leadership.” It’s a case of moral grandstanding as a replacement for a clear evaluation of national self interest.​ Roc Morin on Westerners who volunteered to fight ISIS. Simon Cottee on how ex-cons and criminals are finding an outlet in ISIS. The Academy—and Mattel—Move to Diversify The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced actions to “prune Academy members who no longer actively work in the film industry, while doubling voters of color and female members over the next four years.” Meanwhile, Barbie got a makeover: Mattel announced new skin tones and body types for the doll. On the semantics of “diverse” and “diversity,” Spencer has some thoughts. And David Sims looks at the variety of films at Sundance. In case you missed our reviews from the world of entertainment: Spencer on Rihanna’s new single, “Work.” Sophie on Chelsea Does, a new Netflix series from Chelsea Handler. Megan on I’m Your Girlfriend, an HBO comedy special from Whitney Cummings. David on SyFy’s new show, The Magicians, and NBC’s You, Me and the Apocalypse. Hard at Work or Hardly Working? How do Americans feel about the economy? Not so great, Ron Brownstein reported. Meanwhile, Bourree explored slacking off at work—during good economic times and bad economic times—and the estimated cost of #Snowzilla. Elsewhere in economics: Gillian on “what economists got wrong about free trade.” Joe on rich kids’ affinity for healthier foods. Olga on a connection between Levi 501s jeans and drug trafficking. Ester Bloom on the renewed popularity of hand-painted signs. Tiffany Stanley on the disappearance of African American-owned funeral homes and “a distinctively black way ​to mourn.” The Mysteries of Mankind Did you know that humans are the only animals with chins? Ever heard of foreign-accent syndrome? Olga covered a new attempt to explain a mortality gap for middle-aged whites, while Lizzie Wade defended people who still believe the Earth is flat. Elsewhere, in case you missed: Ed on secretary birds, described as “ninja eagles on stilts.” Rob on Glittering Blue, “a new and stunning way to see the whole Earth” Olga on what a college major says about your personality. Michael Godsey on why it’s difficult to be an introverted teacher. Ian on a Coca-Cola gif generator and the kinds of words it censors. Guns on the Ground Level For our weeks-long special report on guns in the U.S., we wanted to make sure the personal element wasn’t lost. So Caty asked readers to tell us about their earliest experiences with guns. The inbox was soon flooded and the broad range of responses fascinating. Many were nostalgic: But many of the stories were tragic: The latest article in the “Great Power” series (which you can peruse here) is Adrienne’s on the man who invented machine guns. A reader emailed over another piece of hers: Adrienne LaFrance asks, “Is there such a thing as a safe firearm?” It seems complex to answer, but it’s actually pretty simple: Statistically, virtually every firearm is completely safe as far as accidental shootings are concerned. Let me explain using numbers: Accidental gun deaths are fairly stable—about 500-800 per year. About 30 percent of American households have guns in them—[C.B. note: A 2004 Harvard study puts that figure at 38 percent] say 96,000,000 people exposed to guns in their daily lives. Which means that guns are completely safe in terms of accidental shootings to all but .0008 percent of people exposed to them. If we counted the whole U.S. population, then we are looking at .00025 percent. It’s completely negligible. And that’s assuming that every single death is preventable by increased safety features, but the GAO estimates that only about 30 percent of those are preventable by safety features like trigger locks and load indicators. Most of those injuries, it seems, are “normal use” or “user error” injuries sustained when the gun is supposed to be usable. By comparison, almost any other threat you would care to look up is far more dangerous. Prescription painkiller overdose alone kills about 16,000 people a year, or 363 times what accidental gun deaths do. Essentially, guns have to work an entire year to do the harm prescription drug overdose does in one day in terms of accidents. Getting COVID-19 when you’re vaccinated isn’t the same as getting COVID-19 when you’re unvaccinated. A new dichotomy has begun dogging the pandemic discourse. With the rise of the über-transmissible Delta variant, experts are saying you’re either going to get vaccinated, or going to get the coronavirus. For some people—a decent number of us, actually—it’s going to be both. Coronavirus infections are happening among vaccinated people. They’re going to keep happening as long as the virus is with us, and we’re nowhere close to beating it. When a virus has so thoroughly infiltrated the human population, post-vaccination infections become an arithmetic inevitability. As much as we’d like to think otherwise, being vaccinated does not mean being done with SARS-CoV-2. Post-vaccination infections, or breakthroughs, might occasionally turn symptomatic, but they aren’t shameful or aberrant. They also aren’t proof that the shots are failing. These cases are, on average, gentler and less symptomatic; faster-resolving, with less virus lingering—and, it appears, less likely to pass the pathogen on. The immunity offered by vaccines works in iterations and gradations, not absolutes. It does not make a person completely impervious to infection. It also does not evaporate when a few microbes breach a body’s barriers. A breakthrough, despite what it might seem, does not cause our defenses to crumble or even break; it does not erase the protection that’s already been built. Rather than setting up fragile and penetrable shields, vaccines reinforce the defenses we already have, so that we can encounter the virus safely and potentially build further upon that protection. Many queer people are reimagining their own boundaries and thinking of this reentry period as a time for sexual self-discovery. The pandemic has affected our sex lives in many unusual ways, but perhaps none more unusual than this development: The coronavirus has highlighted the possible public-health benefits of glory holes. Sexual positions that make use of walls as physical barriers have long been considered niche. But when the New York City Department of Health recommended them last month as part of a push for safer sex, it tapped into a question that many of us have been asking—How do you seek sexual satisfaction during a global health crisis? I haven’t had sex in more than a year, mostly because I took COVID-19 very seriously. I disconnected from the public sphere. No one visited my apartment. I disinfected my groceries and covered my apartment’s air vents with trash bags. As a queer person, I could barely register the idea of sex while living alongside a deadly virus that nobody really understood. One study published early in the pandemic showed that 43.5 percent of people reported a decrease in the quality of their sex life. Among study participants, they had fewer sexual encounters with other people, and even masturbated less often. Gather friends and feed them, laugh in the face of calamity, and cut out all the things––people, jobs, body parts––that no longer serve you. “The only thing a uterus is good for after a certain point is causing pain and killing you. Why are we even talking about this?” Nora jams a fork into her chopped chicken salad, the one she insisted I order as well. “If your doctor says it needs to come out, yank it out.” Nora speaks her mind the way others breathe: an involuntary reflex, not a choice. (Obviously, all dialogue here, including my own, is recorded from the distortion field of memory.) “But the uterus …” I say, spearing a slice of egg. “It’s so …” “Symbolic?” “Yes. Don’t roll your eyes.” “I’m not rolling my eyes.” She leans in. “I’m trying to get you to face a, well, it’s not even a hard truth. It’s an easy one. Promise me the minute you leave this lunch you’ll pick up the phone and schedule the hysterectomy today. Not tomorrow. Today.” I carried on for more than a year of the coronavirus pandemic, but I didn’t see the next plague coming. After the end of the world, there will be birdsong. I used to imagine this when everything was going awry. I would lie in bed in my college dorm room and listen to the lone mockingbird who sang all night outside my window in the spring months. I was worried about something or other; he was getting on with things. It’s what birds do. They have a knack for it. In the Book of Genesis, after the devastation of the Earth by God’s cataclysmic flood, Noah releases from his ark a dove; he knows that the trial has ended when the bird does not return, having alighted somewhere out in the damp and dreary world, the first land-dwelling creature to begin the work of carrying on. What else is there to do? When COVID-19 began to spread in the United States, late in the winter of 2020, I told myself as much. In plagues, as in life, there is a morally arbitrary hierarchy of luck, and it didn’t take long for me to realize that my family and I were among the lucky ones. I was in my late 20s, hale and hearty, my husband the same plus a couple of years. Our children were young—our baby was, in fact, under a year old, something I eventually mentioned in a meekly anxious aside to a doctor I was interviewing for a story on the emerging pandemic. He acknowledged certain risks in the way that doctors do, and then said: “Don’t worry. Kids are kicking ass with this thing.” I was both comforted and chastened; this wasn’t mine to panic about. The best I could do for those in peril was to carry on. In the United States, this pandemic could be almost over by now. The reasons it’s still going are pretty clear. In the United States, this pandemic could’ve been over by now, and certainly would’ve been by Labor Day. If the pace of vaccination through the summer had been anything like the pace in April and May, the country would be nearing herd immunity. With most adults immunized, new and more infectious coronavirus variants would have nowhere to spread. Life could return nearly to normal. Experts list many reasons for the vaccine slump, but one big reason stands out: vaccine resistance among conservative, evangelical, and rural Americans. Pro-Trump America has decided that vaccine refusal is a statement of identity and a test of loyalty. In April, people in counties that Joe Biden won in 2020 were two points more likely to be fully vaccinated than people in counties that Donald Trump won: 22.8 percent were fully vaccinated in Biden counties; 20.6 percent were fully vaccinated in Trump counties. By early July, the vaccination gap had widened to almost 12 points: 46.7 percent were fully vaccinated in Biden counties, 35 percent in Trump counties. When pollsters ask about vaccine intentions, they record a 30-point gap: 88 percent of Democrats, but only 54 percent of Republicans, want to be vaccinated as soon as possible. All told, Trump support predicts a state’s vaccine refusal better than average income or education level. They’re not all anti-vaxxers, and treating them as such is making things worse. Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said that COVID-19 is “becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.” President Joe Biden said much the same shortly after. They are technically correct. Even against the fast-spreading Delta variant, the vaccines remain highly effective, and people who haven’t received them are falling sick far more often than those who have. But their vulnerability to COVID-19 is the only thing that unvaccinated people universally share. They are disparate in almost every way that matters, including why they haven’t yet been vaccinated and what it might take to persuade them. “‘The unvaccinated’ are not a monolith of defectors,” Rhea Boyd, a pediatrician and public-health advocate in the San Francisco Bay Area, tweeted on Saturday. The once-dynamic state is closing the door on economic opportunity. Behold California, colossus of the West Coast: the most populous American state; the world’s fifth-largest economy; and arguably the most culturally influential, exporting Google searches and Instagram feeds and iPhones and Teslas and Netflix Originals and kimchi quesadillas. This place inspires awe. If I close my eyes I can see silhouettes of Joshua trees against a desert sunrise; seals playing in La Jolla’s craggy coves of sun-spangled, emerald seawater; fog rolling over the rugged Sonoma County coast at sunset into primeval groves of redwoods that John Steinbeck called “ambassadors from another time.” This landscape is bejeweled with engineering feats: the California Aqueduct; the Golden Gate Bridge; and the ribbon of Pacific Coast Highway that stretches south of Monterey, clings to the cliffs of Big Sur, and descends the kelp-strewn Central Coast, where William Hearst built his Xanadu on a hillside where his zebras still graze. No dreamscape better inspires dreamers. Millions still immigrate to my beloved home to improve both their prospects and ours. Robinhood traders have earned the most attention, but they’re only part of a larger story about class stagnation and distrust. On a Wednesday in June, deep in a corner of the Reddit message board r/WallstreetBets, a user going by Your_Boy_Roy_ published a lengthy post. The subreddit, which now has almost 11 million members (or “Degenerates,” as the page officially lists them), has become an epicenter for crowdsourced, short-term, high-risk stock speculation and analysis. Roy had been a member of the group since “its prime,” and had to get something off his chest. “You are all being ridiculous with these endless posts,” he titled his spiel. The subreddit, he wrote, was facing an epidemic of “I made $368 on my BIG DICK YOLO PLAY” entries: overeager, ill-informed, low-stakes-masquerading-as-high-stakes material that he deemed in violation of the forum’s typically brash-yet-chipper atmosphere. A new generation of Latino Protestants is poised to transform our religious and political landscapes. In 2007, when Obe and Jacqueline Arellano were in their mid-20s, they moved from the suburbs of Chicago to Aurora, Illinois, with the dream of starting a church. They chose Aurora, a midsize city with about 200,000 residents, mostly because about 40 percent of its population is Latino. Obe, a first-generation Mexican American pastor, told me, “We sensed God wanted us there.” By 2010, the couple had “planted a church,” the Protestant term for starting a brand-new congregation. This summer, the Arellanos moved to Long Beach, California, to pastor at Light & Life Christian Fellowship, which has planted 20 churches in 20 years. Their story is at once singular and representative of national trends: Across the United States, more Latino pastors are founding churches than ever before, a trend that challenges conventional views of evangelicalism and could have massive implications for the future of American politics. What are we going to do about it? This article was published online on July 26, 2021. One afternoon, during my freshman year at Alabama A&M University, my homework was piling up, and I was feeling antsy. I needed a change of scenery from Foster Hall. I’d heard that the library at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, 10 minutes away, was open three hours longer than our own. So I loaded up my backpack, ran down the stairs—the dorm’s elevator was busted—and headed across town. Founded in 1875 to educate Black students who had been shut out of American higher education, A&M was a second home for me. My mom had gone there; my uncle had been a drum major in the ’80s; my sister was on the volleyball team. But when you’re home long enough, you start to notice flaws: The classroom heaters were always breaking down, and the campus shuttle never seemed to run on time when it was coldest out. When I arrived at UAH, I was shocked. The buildings looked new, and fountains burst from man-made ponds. The library had books and magazines I’d never heard of—including the one for which I now write. Getting COVID-19 when you’re vaccinated isn’t the same as getting COVID-19 when you’re unvaccinated.

Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said that COVID-19 is “becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.” President Joe Biden said much the same shortly after. They are technically correct. Even against the fast-spreading Delta variant, the vaccines remain highly effective, and people who haven’t received them are falling sick far more often than those who have. But their vulnerability to COVID-19 is the only thing that unvaccinated people universally share. They are disparate in almost every way that matters, including why they haven’t yet been vaccinated and what it might take to persuade them. “‘The unvaccinated’ are not a monolith of defectors,” Rhea Boyd, a pediatrician and public-health advocate in the San Francisco Bay Area, tweeted on Saturday. The once-dynamic state is closing the door on economic opportunity. Behold California, colossus of the West Coast: the most populous American state; the world’s fifth-largest economy; and arguably the most culturally influential, exporting Google searches and Instagram feeds and iPhones and Teslas and Netflix Originals and kimchi quesadillas. This place inspires awe. If I close my eyes I can see silhouettes of Joshua trees against a desert sunrise; seals playing in La Jolla’s craggy coves of sun-spangled, emerald seawater; fog rolling over the rugged Sonoma County coast at sunset into primeval groves of redwoods that John Steinbeck called “ambassadors from another time.” This landscape is bejeweled with engineering feats: the California Aqueduct; the Golden Gate Bridge; and the ribbon of Pacific Coast Highway that stretches south of Monterey, clings to the cliffs of Big Sur, and descends the kelp-strewn Central Coast, where William Hearst built his Xanadu on a hillside where his zebras still graze. No dreamscape better inspires dreamers. Millions still immigrate to my beloved home to improve both their prospects and ours. Robinhood traders have earned the most attention, but they’re only part of a larger story about class stagnation and distrust. On a Wednesday in June, deep in a corner of the Reddit message board r/WallstreetBets, a user going by Your_Boy_Roy_ published a lengthy post. The subreddit, which now has almost 11 million members (or “Degenerates,” as the page officially lists them), has become an epicenter for crowdsourced, short-term, high-risk stock speculation and analysis. Roy had been a member of the group since “its prime,” and had to get something off his chest. “You are all being ridiculous with these endless posts,” he titled his spiel. The subreddit, he wrote, was facing an epidemic of “I made $368 on my BIG DICK YOLO PLAY” entries: overeager, ill-informed, low-stakes-masquerading-as-high-stakes material that he deemed in violation of the forum’s typically brash-yet-chipper atmosphere. A new generation of Latino Protestants is poised to transform our religious and political landscapes. In 2007, when Obe and Jacqueline Arellano were in their mid-20s, they moved from the suburbs of Chicago to Aurora, Illinois, with the dream of starting a church. They chose Aurora, a midsize city with about 200,000 residents, mostly because about 40 percent of its population is Latino. Obe, a first-generation Mexican American pastor, told me, “We sensed God wanted us there.” By 2010, the couple had “planted a church,” the Protestant term for starting a brand-new congregation. This summer, the Arellanos moved to Long Beach, California, to pastor at Light & Life Christian Fellowship, which has planted 20 churches in 20 years. Their story is at once singular and representative of national trends: Across the United States, more Latino pastors are founding churches than ever before, a trend that challenges conventional views of evangelicalism and could have massive implications for the future of American politics. What are we going to do about it? This article was published online on July 26, 2021. One afternoon, during my freshman year at Alabama A&M University, my homework was piling up, and I was feeling antsy. I needed a change of scenery from Foster Hall. I’d heard that the library at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, 10 minutes away, was open three hours longer than our own. So I loaded up my backpack, ran down the stairs—the dorm’s elevator was busted—and headed across town. Founded in 1875 to educate Black students who had been shut out of American higher education, A&M was a second home for me. My mom had gone there; my uncle had been a drum major in the ’80s; my sister was on the volleyball team. But when you’re home long enough, you start to notice flaws: The classroom heaters were always breaking down, and the campus shuttle never seemed to run on time when it was coldest out. When I arrived at UAH, I was shocked. The buildings looked new, and fountains burst from man-made ponds. The library had books and magazines I’d never heard of—including the one for which I now write. TheAtlantic.com Copyright (c) 2021 by The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights

452,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/kAP6WGteNbA/,"You feel your whiteness properly at the American border. Most of the time being white is an absence of problems. The police don’t bother you so you don’t notice the police not bothering you. You get the job so you don’t notice not getting it. Your children are not confused with criminals. I live in downtown Toronto, in one of the most liberal neighborhoods in one of the most open cities in the world, where multiculturalism is the dominant civic value and the inert virtue of tolerance is the most prominent inheritance of the British empire, so if you squint you can pretend the ancient categories are dissipating into a haze of enlightenment and intermarriage. Not at the border. My son’s Guyanese-Canadian teacher and the Muslim Milton scholar I went to high school with and the Sikh writer I squabble about Harold Innis with and my Ishmaeli accountant, we can all be good little Torontonians of the middle class, deflecting the differences we have been trained to respect. But in a car in the carbon monoxide-infused queue waiting to enter Detroit, their beings diverge drastically from mine. I am white. They are not. They are vulnerable. I am not. Here’s the thing: I like the guards at the American border. They’re always friendly with me, decent, even enjoyable company. At the booth in between the never-was of Windsor and the has-been of Detroit, the officer I happened to draw had a gruff belly and the mysterious air of intentional inscrutability, like a troll under a bridge in a fairy tale. “Where are you headed?” he asked. “Burlington, Iowa.” “Why would anyone ever choose to go to Burlington, Iowa?” he asked philosophically. “I’m going to see Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.” Then, because it did seem to require an explanation: “They’re giving rallies within a couple of days of each other.” “Why would anyone ever choose to go see Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders?” I didn’t argue, because it was the border, but I could have said that the police chief of Birmingham estimated that 30,000 people showed up in Alabama to see Donald Trump in August and that in Dallas, he had filled the American Airlines Center, and that his counterpart, Bernie Sanders, has generated equally unprecedented numbers – vastly more than Barack Obama drew at comparable moments in the 2008 campaign. “I’m curious,” I said instead. At this point he asked me to roll down my window. But it was all fine. Like I said, I’m white. As I drove through the outskirts of the ruins of Detroit, across the I-94, one of the ugliest highways in the United States, the old familiar lightness fluttered to my heart. I love America. America is not my mother. Canada is my mother. But America is an unbelievably gorgeous, surprisingly sweet rich lady who lives next door and appears to be falling apart. I cannot help myself from loving it. For people who love to dwell in contradictions, the US is the greatest country in the world: the land of the free built on slavery, the country of law and order where everyone is entitled to a gun, a place of unimpeded progress where they cling to backwardness out of sheer stubbornness. And into this glorious morass, a new contradiction has recently announced itself: The white people, the privileged Americans, the ones who had the least to fear from the powers that be, the ones with the surest paths to brighter futures, the ones who are by every metric one of the most fortunate groups in the history of the world, were starting to dying off in shocking numbers. The Case and Deaton report,  Rising Morbidity and Mortality in Midlife among White Non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st Century  , describes an increased death rate for middle-aged American whites “comparable to lives lost in the US Aids epidemic.” This spike in mortality is unique to white Americans – not to be found among other ethnic groups in the United States or any other white population in the developed world, a mysterious plague of despair. In one way, it was easy to account for all this white American death – “drug and alcohol poisoning, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis” according to the report. It was not so easy to account for the accounting. Why were middle-aged white Americans drinking and drugging and shooting themselves to death? The explanations on offer were pre-prepared, fully plugged into confirmation bias: it was the economy or it was demography or it was godlessness or it was religion or it was the breakdown of the family or it was the persistence of antique values or it was the lack of social programs or it was the dependence on social programs. Case and Deaton call it “an epidemic of pain”. Fine. What does that mean? On the I-94, you do find yourself asking: what the fuck is wrong with these people? I mean, aside from the rapid decline of the middle class obviously. And the rise of precarious work and the fact that the basic way of life requires so much sedation that nearly a quarter of all Americans are on psychiatric drugs, and somewhere between 26.4 and 36 million Americans abuse opioids every day. Oh yes, and the mass shootings. There was more than one  mass shooting a day  . And the white terrorists targeting black churches again. And the regularly released videos showing the police assassinating black people. And the police in question never being indicted, let alone being sent to jail. And you know what Americans were worried about while all this shit was raining down on them? While all this insanity was wounding their beloved country? You know what their number one worry was, according to poll after poll after poll? Muslims. Muslims, if you can believe it. My body is white and it is male. It is six foot tall and weighs 190lbs. It is 39 years old and it has had to start running. It has had to start counting calories. There is a tingle in the joint of my right thigh, so I try not to think about my body. The tingling comes and goes. I know my body is going to kill me. “A man who fears suffering already suffer what he fears,” as Montaigne said. That’s one of the reasons why men die so much younger than women – six years younger on average in America. Ninety-two percent of men say they wait at least a few days to see if they feel better before they go to a doctor, but I know what they mean by a few days. They mean a few more days that makes sense. It is hard to have a male and white body and to conceive of its weakness. In the same breath, my body cannot bring itself to believe it is the personification of power, though it evidently is in any rational accountancy of social status. It feels like a mere body. It feels mortal. I’ve never been to a place as white as Iowa. That’s the honest truth. Whenever I go to America it’s New York or Chicago or Los Angeles or Florida. In Burlington, at Jerry’s Main Lunch, the signature dish is “the hot mess, eggs and bacon cooked right into the hash browns. The sugar shakers all have white crackers in them, to prevent clumping – a classic bit of common-sense American know-how. The hot mess is delicious. Why don’t they make these everywhere? Why isn’t there a chain of Jerry’s Main Lunches serving hot messes all across the midwest? The answer is in the rest of the town: everything that’s going to leave has already left Burlington. The beautiful brick buildings downtown are mostly vacant. The most interesting street is the road out of town. The Memorial Arena, on the banks of the Mississippi, filled up early. Trump wasn’t speaking until 6pm but by 4.45 the parking situation was grim. Outside the building, the hawkers who follow Trump on the road, event to event, sold T-shirts and buttons, three for $10. “We shall overcomb.” “Cats for Trump, the time is Meow.” “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.” Inside, every seat had been taken and the floor filled quickly with a standing room only crowd. Burlington is 10% black. The rally was 99.99% white. The people who attend political rallies in America are a specific genre of humanity, like the people who stand outside in lines for nightclubs. They know where they’re supposed to go and how they’re supposed to behave when they get there. They have gear. An elderly lady sat beside me wearing a sequined stars-and-stripes-hat she clearly takes out for just these occasions. “Y’all from Illinois?” she asked. I’m not but I can pass. She goes to all the rallies, she explained. She’s been a Republican her whole life, an active Republican, an Iowa Republican. For 30 years, she’s been in crowds like this one. She plans to go, one time in her life, to the national convention. Like going to see the Stones. When the organizers passed around hand signs reading “The Silent Majority”, she grabbed a dozen so she could pass them around to others. Cheerful helpful women were half the crowd. Angry and absurd men were the other. They wore T-shirts with whole paragraphs written on them: “I am a United States Military Veteran. I once took a SOLEMN OATH to defend the CONSTITUTION against ALL enemies, foreign and Domestic. Be advised No one has ever relieved me of my duties under this Oath!” There were cars in the parking lot slathered with bumper stickers. “We the people are 100% FED UP!” “So if guns kills people, I guess pencils miss spell words [sic], cars drive drunk and spoons make people fat.” “I’m straight, conservative, Christian, and I own a gun. Is there anything else I can do to piss you off?” A picture of Obama with “Does this ass make my car look big?” The Republican style for 2016 is angry aphoristic humor. Behind comedy, absurd rage: America is the greatest country in the world but America is falling apart, government is the problem which is why government must solve it. This was a Trump production so naturally there was a VIP section. A door guarded by bald, unsmiling men, the bouncers who stand forever as the bored sentinels of indifferent celebrity. A swinging door at the side of the stage received and dispensed the best-looking people, the ones with the buffed neutrality of political professionals, the women whose faces have been tautened to a perma pout, the men who get their hair cut before every event. The woman beside me – Stars ’n’ Stripes Hat – was wearing a pewter elephant pendant. A young girl in a bright orange dress passed out of the VIP entrance wearing an elephant pendant encrusted with diamonds. Elephant pendants were a theme, I noticed, and elephant brooches and elephant rings and elephant T-shirts. They came in all different price points and in all different styles: round elephants reminiscent of French cartoons from the 1960s, and strange pseudo-sexual shimmies, and with 1920s straw boater hats leading parades. There was one kind of elephant you couldn’t find. An elephant that actually looked like an elephant. A realistic elephant might serve as a memento to the hundred elephants killed for their ivory every day. A naturalistic elephant would be inherently environmentalist. The elephants must all be fabulous. Like any good show, there was a warm-up act. In fact, there are two – three if you count the recitation of the pledge of allegiance. The first was Tana Goertz, an Iowa woman who had been runner-up on the third season of The Apprentice. “What a good-looking crowd,” she pandered. She vouched for Trump as a woman (“He loves women!”) and as someone who had returned to Iowa (“How could you live in New York City if you didn’t love people?”). She promoted the idea which is at the core of every last thing that Trump does, that simple contact with the man brings prosperity. “When you’re in the Trump train you’re going places!” She walked off to polite Iowan applause. The crowd would probably, all things considered, rather have listened to the Elton John music playing on the speakers instead, but at least she made the effort. A more standard hype man followed. Sam Clovis hosts a conservative radio show and is a tea-party activist who has run and lost a bunch of Iowa Republican positions. He just started right in with it. Trump was “one of the greatest men to ever walk the face of this earth,” a good line – the crowd could have laughed but instead they applauded, thus proving that they were not paying attention or would swallow anything. Clovis compared Trump’s recent speeches to Reagan’s  A Time for Choosing  at the Goldwater convention in 1964, which must have been, to his way of thinking anyway, roughly like comparing it to the Sermon on the Mount. Clovis knew what the crowd had come to hear and he gave it to them. “America and Americans will be first again!” A collective roar shook the Burlington Memorial Arena. They so badly wanted to be first again. First in what was unclear but definitely first. After the roar died, the crowd was ready for Trump. But, showmanship. Trump let the tension build; the angry absurd men and the cheerful, helpful women hollered. Trump! Trump! Trump! I could barely imagine the pleasure the muted sound of his chanted name, from backstage, must have been bringing the man. When he finally took the stage, the crowd surged; their phones surged. It was an orgy of phones. The men behind Trump scanned the crowd with their phones. The cameras in the back were recording everyone recording each other. Trump was the only person not holding a screen, the absence that brought desire. He started roaring, as everybody in the crowd stopped to check the footage they had gathered. Trump started out with the clip he knew would appear on the news the next morning – Joe Biden had dropped out of the race and Trump approved of his decision because Biden never had a chance and Trump wanted to face Hillary. The mainstream media adroitly handled, Trump began his disquisition on the subject dearest to his heart: his own success. The Burlington rally marked the 100th day he had lead the polls. He read the polls, poll after poll. He paused only to ask the crowd how great the polls were. “Beating Hillary nationwide do you love that?” The crowd approved of his approval numbers. And so he moved on to the more qualitative aspects of his greatness. His opponents just weren’t winners. “I speak from the brain but I also speak from the heart,” he said, rambling like a rich know-it-all uncle – “I’m bringing back the jobs from China!” – with brief digressions into self-pity: “Macy’s was very disloyal to me. They don’t sell my ties anymore.” He described, in twists intermittently frank and self-deluded, the brilliance of his own capacity for political manipulation. He talked to the people he was spinning about how cleverly he was spinning them. So he declared “I’m a good Christian” and that if he became president “we’re going to be saying merry Christmas,” but then he couldn’t stop himself from acknowledging the cleverness of his Christian electioneering: “I walked onto a stage with a bible, everybody likes me better.” Trump brought meta to Burlington, Iowa. And he did not deny the crowd that taste of celebrity they desired. What would he say to Caroline Kennedy, the ambassador to Japan? “You’re fired!” “You’re fired!” A few spectators started to drift out to beat the traffic and Trump shouted about the silent majority and about how he says what nobody else dares to say and about how he will end free trade and how Mexicans are car thieves (big laugh) and how he wants a piece of the action from the Keystone pipeline and how he’s going to help women’s health and how America used to be emulated. “The American Dream is dead but I’m going to make it bigger and stronger!” he shouted. At this moment he appeared to me the way every celebrity I have met in the flesh does, like a living pagan idol awaiting sacrifice, a puff-faced Baal. “We’re going to win so much,” he promised before leaving the stage to Twisted Sister’s We’re Not Going to Take It. I stayed to watch Trump work the line. Up close, in person, the hair is much more intricate than it appears on screen. Its construction is tripartite, its significance polyvalent. First and foremost, there is the comb-over, although it can be called a comb-over only in the sense that the mall in Dubai with a ski hill inside it can be called a building. It is hair as state-of-the-art engineering feat, with the diaphanous quality of a cloak out of Norse legend or some miraculous near-weightless metal developed in an advanced German laboratory. It floats over the skull, an act of defiance not only against aging and loss but against time and space, against reality. Behind the technical display of the comb-over, as counterpoint, the back is as traditional and old-fashioned as a haircut can be. It’s a classic ducktail. It’s such a classic that I have only seen it in movies set in the 1950s. Not movies from the 1950s I should be clear, but movies from the 1970s about the 1950s. In between the comb-over and the ducktail, between the two follicular spaces representing the modernistic and the atavistic, the fantastical and the nostalgic, there is a third tranche. Even in person you have to look closely to catch sight of it. It bulges, slightly but only slightly. It is the real part of the hair, the human part, the actual hair. It is the hinge of Donald Trump. As Trump’s campaign for the Republican nomination has unfolded, in all its unlikeliness, he has shaken hands with many thousands of Americans, and posed with many thousands for many thousands of selfies. And among those many thousands, not one has reached up to mess up his hair. Though he regularly brings up the physical appearances of his opponent, none of the other candidates even mention the fact that he looks ridiculous. Trump’s hair is an act of defiant social pre-emption: call me a phony. I dare you. I fucking dare you. A few hardcore fans lingered on the fringes, just like at a concert. Everybody else had drifted into the parking lot and the town center of Burlington was soon returned to its emptiness. A Trump show is good value for the money, especially since it’s free. They don’t even ask for donations. The morning after the rally, it has become clear that Iowa may be the bramble in Trump’s path. A scandal over an errant tweet has cloudburst. He blames the insult on a young intern. But the eight-point rise of Carson must be galling. Trump possesses the weakness of anyone who lives by the strength of their results. Results vary. When the results are down, where are you? Who are you? Trump is in the business of winning. Does Trump losing even exist? I had a day between Trump and Sanders, and all I had to read was a pdf of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s  Between the World and Me  , which I had agreed to look at for a book of the month club. After another hot mess at Jerry’s Main Lunch, and a run to burn it off, I spent a day at the Motel 8 in Burlington reading, while across the street, the Winegard factory, manufacturing satellite dishes 24 hours a day, thudded like a heart without syncopation. Did you know you can buy a six pack of beer and a bottle of bourbon for just a little over 20 bucks in Iowa? What a great country. The title of Between the World and Me comes from a Richard Wright poem called  White Man, Listen!  and it was never going to get much whiter or more male than me in the Motel 8 sipping bourbon and beer, on my iPhone, with the Jays and Royals highlights flickering in the background and the thud of the satellite dish factory in the background. The urgency of the book, the vitality of the historical imagination at play, rose like waves into crests of anger tumbling over their own force. It was all of a piece. And it all made very ferocious sense. Between the World and Me is one of those books that possess the powerful inevitability of a natural phenomenon – as if it accrued out of the ether that surrounds us, a crystalline formation of the outrage that defines the moment. To criticize is beside the point. It’s just there. To me, the key passage in Between the World and Me, comes after Coates has been on television explaining to the host the desperate consequences of yet another police assassination of a black boy. I came out of the studio and walked for a while. It was a calm December day. Families, believing themselves white, were out on the streets. Infants, raised to be white, were bundled in strollers. And I was sad for these people, much as I was sad for the host and sad for all the people out there watching and reveling in a specious hope. I realized then why I was sad. When the journalist asked me about my body, it was like she was asking me to awaken her from the most gorgeous dream. I have seen that dream all my life. It is perfect houses with nice lawns. It is Memorial Day cookouts, block associations, and driveways. The Dream is treehouses and the Cub Scouts. The Dream smells like peppermint but tastes like strawberry shortcake. Right then, reading that passage, I knew that white people were going to love this book. What white people crave – more, they require it, they require it to live – is an alibi from their whiteness, an escape from the injustice of their existence. There are various alibis available depending on how much stupidity you can tolerate. You can say to yourself or to others that black people are stupid and lazy; you can say that you don’t see color; you can call your uncle a racist so everybody knows you’re not; you can share the latest critique of brutality on Twitter with the word THIS; and now you can tell a friend that she really has to read Between the World and Me. Because that Dream of Whiteness, the dream of treehouses and cub scouts that tastes like peppermint and smells like strawberry shortcake, is a perfect alibi. Who lives that dream? Somebody else may live it but not me, not anyone I know, no one I could see in Burlington. That’s a dream that belongs to somebody else. Always to somebody else. It certainly didn’t belong to the Winegard factory workers who were drifting to their cars at the end of their shift. The whiteness of my existence was my iPhone and the fumes of bourbon and beer, and the game from last night and the tingling in my thigh. The tingling in my thigh was my body – the reality I can’t look at because I’m too afraid of my mortality. To me, the best question ever asked about race in America has always been the one that James Baldwin asked, when an interviewer wanted to know if he was optimistic or pessimistic about the future of America. “What white people have to do is try and find out in their own hearts why it was necessary to have a nigger in the first place,”  he said  . “If you invented him, you, the white people invented him, then you’ve got to find out why. And the future of the country depends on that.” The obsession of intellectuals over the question of Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, Jr active or passive resistance – was moot; the pressing matter was why white people were blowing up churches filled with children. Whiteness is a spiritual distortion, evidently – by the fruit ye shall know the tree. And on the question of white pathology, what good answers has America produced since Baldwin asked that question in 1963? And now that white pathology has returned to waste away its host, unexamined and mysterious, a golem. In the evening, I finished the book and didn’t want to think about my white and male body anymore, or the tingling in my thigh. Across from my hotel, the Fun City complex contained an imitation midway, a bowling alley, a couple of bars, a replica diner and, tucked in between a hotel and a spa, the Catfish Bend Casino. The poker room is dingy but serviceable. A game started at six. I wanted to play. I wanted to find out how much fun can you have in a place called Fun City. The youngest guy at the table, Curved Baseball Hat, grew beans and corn. A man with an angry mustache ran the conversation, a three-day beard beside him adding an occasional aside. The rest of us sat cooking quietly in the juices of our addictions, like in any casino. Everybody at the table knew everybody else, except for me and a black welder in town for a specialist job. It was happy hour in Fun City, and beer was a dollar. Everybody ordered a mess of them. And I felt just how lucky it is to be in America, despite politics, despite everything. Cheap beer and frank people and an honestly run game in a clean room. Even compared to Canada, the unthinking prosperity of the place is dazzling. Three Day Beard had seen Trump the night before, and Angry Mustache asked his opinion. “I think he could win,” Three Day Beard said cautiously, as if it were a criticism, as if it were all you could say of him, that he might have a chance to take the presidency, for what it was worth. “Don’t matter,” said Angry Mustache. “No matter who gets in, Washington just ruins them.” “He might be different because he doesn’t need the money.” Angry Mustache quoted a statistic, which I later check and turns out to be bullshit, that all congressmen become millionaires by the time they’ve been in office for a year. Everybody agreed that Trump’s main advantage is that he comes pre-corrupted. “It’s not even the money,” Three Day Beard said. “They get there. They all have these schemes and plans. They can’t do anything.” Three Day Beard almost pitied the politicians. “It’s all broken,” added Angry Mustache as a kind of given, the way you’d state any historical fact, like “Germany lost the second world war” or “Frances Farmer was once a star.” The view of American politics in Fun City is snug despair. It is despair not just at who happens to be in power but at whoever could ever be in power. It is despair not simply that the system is broken but that any system, imaginable in the current iteration of the United States, would turn out to be just as broken. The choice is a choice between impotence and coercion. The response was not revolution but a shrug. Curved Baseball Hat, the guy who grows corn and beans and who had delicate traces of soil in the lanulae of his fingernails, asked about an old gambling hall that used to be in town, and the reminiscences of the way Burlington used to be flowed – buildings that had been knocked down, women that were once beautiful and were now dead, fortunes made and vanished. Eventually the black player, who has said almost nothing except his calls and folds and raises, busted out. “Did you see that guy’s fingers?” Angry Mustache asks when he had left. He gestured an inch past his middle finger. We were all, it was made very clear, in a room of white men. “You know what they say. My brother worked in the prison and he says it’s all true. I guess that’s why they say once you go black.” The rest of us nodded or smiled or said nothing, looking down at the cards. Now that we had all shown how white we were, it was a friendlier room. We knew that none of us would object to the evil of the others. What if the answer to Baldwin’s question is as banal as it appeared to be in Fun City? What if it white people make the nigger to make themselves a little less lonely? And I said nothing. I offered no resistance, though the line between the man in Fun City and the cop shooting a black child in the face was not hard to trace. Here was my alibi that evening: I am Canadian. Which means I am a spy from nowhere. Or perhaps I am a coward or something in between a coward and spy from nowhere. It’s a pretty threadbare alibi anyway. Whose isn’t? Conversation drifted back to Trump. It was more polite. “I can see Trump,” said Angry Mustache. “He’s not the worst that I’ve seen anyway.” “I’m starting to like that doctor,” Three Day Beard adds as an afterthought. That doctor, Ben Carson, proposes a flat tax of 10% that would put the US government, estimating conservatively, in a $3tn-deficit. He believes that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain, and he believes that Hitler never would have risen to power if the German people were armed, and that Obamacare is worse than slavery, and that Americans are living in a Gestapo age. I wish that Coates had some crazy scheme, some utopian fantasy for communards in Georgia, or the return to one motherland or another, but he just wants the end of white supremacy. He just wants white people in America to grow up, to cede their inhumane sense of absurd superiority. I cannot imagine why they would. It’s fun to drink and to play cards and to imagine what Donald Trump would say to the Mexican president the day after he was elected, or whether Ben Carson would set the flat tax at 10 or 12%. The ultimate alibi is ignorance – it lies closest to innocence – but if you can’t manage ignorance, craziness does nearly as well. I mean, none of it’s going to happen anyway, right? Whoever gets elected, it’s just going to be gridlock and outrage anyway, right? Did I mention that beer cost one dollar? A single, solitary buck. The Bernie Sanders rally in Davenport was the precise opposite of the Donald Trump rally in Burlington and yet precisely the same in every detail. “Make America Great Again” was replaced by “Feel the Bern.” Hawkers sold pins, three for $10. They read “Bernie Sanders is my spirit animal” and “Cats for Bernie” and “I supported Bernie Sanders before it was cool.” Davenport, at least near the Adler Theater, is the same Brooklyn-outside-Brooklyn that has conquered every corner of the world that is not a strip mall. The tattoo artists of Davenport do not go hungry. The cornfed hipsters at the Sanders rally look like they have probably attended a party at which somebody played a bongo. They may even have attended a literary reading. There were hype men as with Trump, too, although in this case they were twentyish women in glasses screaming “Feel the Bern!” and “We’re Going to Build a Revolution!” Somebody with a camera from NBC asked a group who has brought their precocious children because they want them to be engaged in the political process “Can I get you guys to look like you’re excited about Bernie?” They carefully placed their drinks on the floor, out of sight, to oblige. The same specter of angry white people haunts Saunders’s rally, the same sense of longing for a country that was, the country that has been taken away. The Bernie crowd brought homemade signs instead of manufactured ones, because I guess they’re organic. They waved them just the same. They were going to a show. They wanted to be a good audience. The fundamental difference between the Trump and Sanders crowd was that the Sanders’s crowd has more money, the natural consequence of the American contradiction machinery: rich white people can afford to think about socialism, the poor can only afford their anger. Sanders’s opening act was a congressional hopeful, Gary Kroeger. He hadn’t been on The Apprentice but on Saturday Night Live, a forgettable lesser actor from the great period between 1982 and 1985. He started out, naturally, with a half-assed gag: “the fresh patchouli in the air is so beautiful.” The sign language translator offered a mild smile to indicate it was a joke. Then, after a brief foray into left-wingery, calling America a “social democracy also known as a republic”, Kroeger took a big selfie with the crowd behind him: “Ellen Degeneres, eat your heart out!” he shouted. Everyone’s phones rose up to take pictures of themselves in a picture imitating a picture from the Oscars: such was American socialism in the year 2015. A few desultory bands followed, performing an assortment of leftwing songs from various historical leftwing movements. They harmonized on The Auld Triangle, a prison ballad that was covered on Inside Llewelyn Davis. The singer from Alice in Chains (remember them?) did an electric version of I Won’t Back Down. An old The Clash song, Jail Guitar Doors, was sung by the subject of the first verse, Wayne Kramer. And it was all, so obviously, a nostalgia act, the indulgence for a longing of a time when music encouraged politics, when activism possessed an artistic face, and vice versa. Eventually Bernie wandered out. The phones went up. The phones went down. “Enough is enough,” he shouted, leaving blank what there’s been enough of. And then he talked about how he wanted to end the war on drugs and campaign finance reform and government that isn’t for plutocrats, and how they were going to build a revolution (such an embarrassing word to hear uttered out loud), and America was going to be a social democracy, by the people of the people. Sanders’s exasperation was the principal fact to be communicated, more than any political content. Trump was about winning again. Sanders was about having lost. The vagueness of American politics is what astonished the outsider. It’s all about feelings and God and bullshit. Sanders actually uttered the following sentence out loud: “What we’re saying is when millions of people come together to restore their government we can do extraordinary things.” Nobody asked what he meant. Nobody asked for numbers. They applauded. Better to take it in the spirit in which it’s given, like a Catskills resort comedian. Sanders reminded me of a line from Seinfeld, maybe because Larry David’s SNL parody was only a few days’ old. “The sea was angry that day, my friends, like an old man trying to send back soup at a deli.” When Ben and Jerry make a Bernie Sanders ice cream, I hope it’s chili and ginger: the delicious hot flavour of nasal-passage clearing outrage. Sanders’s speech was much shorter than Trump’s. There had already been the music, I guess. I had the impression, as with Trump, that I had traveled many hundreds of miles to look at a man’s hair. Bernie Sanders’s hair is as much a statement as Trump’s. It looks like the hair of a tenured professor whose wife has stopped nagging him to get a haircut because the nagging doesn’t work. You couldn’t muss Sanders hair. The disorder is just as much an aesthetic as the comb-over. I mean it always looks the same. Somebody is cutting it to droop that way over the ears. As despair has suddenly spread like a fabulous mist over the white people of America, as the white people die off in their unprecedented numbers, the commenters are surprised, a bit, but they have no plan of action. No policy proposals aim at ameliorating the conditions of white people. How could they? If you believe the Case and Deaton report, white people are victims of their own privilege – literally. Their cherished right to own guns, and the vast increase in the ownership of weaponry, means that their suicide attempts are more effective. They have more access to opioids because doctors are more likely to trust white people with them. They have the money to make themselves lonely and drink. I remember reading a passage from bell hooks once, the kind that circulates on Facebook because it sounds slightly unusual in its predictable virtue. “The first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males,” she wrote, “is not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage is psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves.” Her compassion is admirable, glorious even, but also inaccurate. No one is more emotional than a piece-of-shit white man. They are sentimentality personified. How else can so many be moved to rage over the absence of a Christmas tree on a Starbucks cup? That dream, that white dream that smells like peppermint and tastes like strawberry shortcake, comes with a cost of shit. If you take shit, if you eat shit, if you live through the shit, if you survive the stupid wars and the meaningless jobs, you should be sure of who you are and what you deserve. And if you are not sure and you have not received what you deserved, why did you take and eat and breathe all that shit? In the aftermath of that deal, the choice, I suppose, is either to be proud to be white, which is a form of insanity, or to fantasize a post-racial cosmopolis, which is a kind of make-believe, or to be ashamed. So much easier to forget those choices, or to defer endlessly the choosing, or to debate the difficulties of choosing infinitely, because white male flesh is not under mortal threat, as the flesh of black men or the flesh of women. Our bodies are safe. Our bodies are the threat. In medieval monarchies, the state required the existence of a double body, one for the real world and one for the symbolic. There was the flawed and mortal body of the king, which wept and shat and screwed and died, and then there was the Body of the King, sacred, pure, indestructible. Race gives us all double bodies, “double consciousness” in WEB Du Bois’s phrase, whatever you want to call having to live mortally through the judgment of others. The new white distortion, the sickness at heart, the pathology, may simply be the arrival of the awareness of two bodies: the dizziness and nausea that arrive with the onset of double vision. Because they have to be like everybody else, their hearts are breaking in half. The morning after the Sanders rally, I found enough strength to look in the mirror at my white and male body, to examine its mortal and symbolic nature. At the corner of my groin, where it had been tingling, a brown patch spilled like spoiled milk down my skin. A wide brown patch shaped like post-climate change Florida in the corner of my thigh. Instantly, I knew I would die. And the next moment I started driving back to Toronto, to my wife and children, flesh of my flesh. Bernie Sanders wants a revolution to overthrow casino capitalism but the problem, or maybe just the first problem, is that the American people love casinos. They can’t build them fast enough. On the road from Iowa, I passed at least a dozen, a dozen Fun Cities of various shapes and sizes, enduring various conversations about Trump and Sanders. The highways of Illinois are a unique vision of the workings of human desire – a nearly limitless marketplace for addiction and its cure. Strip clubs or fried chicken or gambling or church or rehab or cancer treatment. The I-94 spoke right to the unwounded body – the promise of processed sugar and pussy, or salvation from them. There was one other attraction on the route home: Ronald Reagan’s birthplace in Tampico. The beauty of the landscape around those towns, for some reason, has never been properly romanticized. There are no tourist busses to these fields, as there are to the ocean or the mountains, but the landscape is every bit as sublime. Reagan’s childhood passed in the loin of the Continent, the grand hinge between the industrial core of the Great Lakes and the agricultural heartland. The historical memory of his presidential monuments has been consumed by fantasies of small town life but it is a landscape of whitewashed buildings against the undulating emptiness, a country roiling with dreams. You can picture Reagan as a boy in these fields, dreaming of movies and America – vast screens on which he could project himself. The highway runs like a river of craving through an ancient dream. The ancient dreams are still so vivid here. In the United States, 240-year-old writings can be recited by heart by people who cannot be described as educated. Documents written by men who owned slaves are spoken of as if they could solve the problems of today and tomorrow and any conceivable future no matter how distant. Thomas Jefferson believed that the Constitution should expire after 19 years, so that the dead would not have dominion over the living. That fate seems to have arrived. The Americans are in constant debates with ghosts and their conversations with dead people are most powerful, most ferocious, at exactly the points where they are most nonsensical. They state defiantly that all men are created equal when any casual observer of life knows they aren’t. They claim that men and women should be judged by the content of their character, when nobody can know the content of another’s character. These dreams, these impossibilities, are the absolute and real foundation of their nation. And the dreams are so entrancing that it’s unclear whether the problem is that the Americans believe them, or that they don’t. It’s supremely childish, either way. Back in Toronto, my wife took a look at the brown patch on my groin and sent me to a doctor, and the doctor told me it was a rash from running too much, and I had been given the greatest gift anyone can hope for, in this time and this place. I had been forgiven, for a while, for my body. MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell speculated this week that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will resign on the morning of August 13.

453,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/Psn7xTq4F9I/,"Bomb and mass shooting threats were made against more than two dozen schools in New Jersey on Tuesday, along with schools in at least six other states, forcing evacuations and lockdowns that affected thousands of students. They were the latest in a string of anonymous threats of violence, all apparent hoaxes, made against U.S. schools in recent weeks. As least 26 schools in New Jersey received the threats by phone starting at about 8:50 a.m. EST, said Bergen County Sheriff Michael Saudino, adding that the schools were all subsequently declared safe. ""When we catch the people doing this, an example is going to be made,"" Saudino said. Made in a robotic voice, the threats appeared to come from computer-generated phone numbers that could be traced back to a location in Bakersfield, California, Saudino said. Bergen County prosecutor Gurbir Grewal said his office felt confident it would help catch the culprits. ""There are digital fingerprints and we will follow up on each and every lead,"" Grewal said. The threats, which may have been automated because they were so similar, were received by high schools in Teaneck, Garfield, Tenafly, Clifton, Fair Lawn, Leonia, Bergenfield, Englewood and Hackensack, police said. Some of the New Jersey schools were threatened with bombs and others with mass shootings, police said. In Massachusetts, schools in at least 15 communities received threats, state police said. They offered no details but said no hazardous materials or other credible threats were found after searches of the schools. Nine Boston-area schools were the targets of similar threats on Friday. Delaware State Police said they were also investigating threats, made by phone in a robotic or computer generated-style voice, to at least three schools. The menacing calls were made at about 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and forced the evacuation of elementary schools in Millsboro, Middletown and a high school in Greenwood, police said in a statement. Police did not release information about the nature of the threats. Threats were also made to schools in communities including Iowa City, Iowa, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Mesa, Arizona and North Miami, Florida, according to statements from local law enforcement agencies.

454,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/f20RCcV19_8/,"A New Hampshire elected official has been barred from school grounds after describing in graphic detail how he might hypothetically commit a school shooting. Jorge Mesa-Tejada, the chairman of the Hampstead Advisory Budget Committee, made the remarks Thursday during a public discussion about safety concerns regarding mobile classrooms at a local elementary school. The Tea Party Republican opposes a $4.5 million construction bond, and his controversial remarks were in response to an infomercial produced by school officials that argues new buildings are needed, among other reasons, to protect children from potential sniper attacks. Mesa-Tejada said renovations would not make Hampstead Central School any safer, and he then launched into a highly detailed description of how he might carry out a mass shooting at the school. “Based on today’s situation, we can have snipers anywhere shooting people and all that, they might be shot,"" he said. ""Well, that’s true, it could happen -- but based on my Marine Corps training, if I wanted to really do harm, I wouldn’t do it while they’re going from the portables to the main building. I would wait until recess. I would hide in the woods behind them and I’d have a field day.” Another board member cut off Mesa-Tejada at that point, saying, ""No more."" The school superintendent issued a no-trespass order Friday barring the budget committee chairman from school property without permission, and school officials said they were baffled and disturbed by the comments. “I can't even begin to explain how someone goes from discussing a bond article, talking about construction at the school, to detailing how he would commit a mass shooting at our elementary school,” said Jason Cipriano, Hampstead School Board chairman. “I can't speak to him and his mentality, or how he got there. All I can say is that I am very disturbed.” Mesa-Tejada has served as an elected official for decades, and the school superintendent said he had been warned about inflammatory comments he's made in the past. “Anybody that puts our children's safety at risk, I don't think is fit to serve in any public capacity,” said Earl Metzler, school superintendent. A parent of two children at the elementary school said the comments were no joke. ""When I saw the recording, I had two first reactions,"" said Caitlin Parnell, a mother of a first- and third-grader. ""One was disbelief that an elected official would be talking this way, and my second reaction was to feel sick to my stomach."" Mesa-Tejada apologized for his remarks, saying that he should not have described potential threat in such detail. ""My intention was to highlight the fact that the children are more at risk on the playground than when moving between the trailers and the main building, should someone want to harm them,"" he said. ""Stupidly, I used excessively graphic language. It’s inexcusable and I apologize.""

456,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/o5jyQXM9l8U/,"President Barack Obama on Tuesday described new steps his administration will take to tighten gun rules and urged Americans to vote for candidates who do more to prevent gun violence, wiping back tears as he remembered children who died in a mass shooting. As Obama delivered a powerful address in the White House, surrounded by family members of people killed in shootings, his voice rose to a yell as he said the constitutional rights of Americans to bear arms needed to be balanced by the right to worship, gather peacefully and live their lives. Obama has often said his toughest time in office was grappling with the December 2012 massacre of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. ""Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,"" Obama said, tears rolling down his cheek. ""That changed me, that day,"" he said, after being introduced by Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son was killed in the shooting. ""My hope earnestly has been that it would change the country."" After that tragedy, the Democratic president failed to persuade Congress to toughen U.S. gun laws. He has blamed lawmakers for being in the thrall of the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby group. He said Americans need to be ""just as passionate"" as the NRA in changing gun laws, but acknowledged it won't happen during his final year in office. Obama laid out executive action he is taking to require more gun sellers to get licenses and more gun buyers to undergo background checks. Under the changes, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) will issue guidelines intended to narrow exceptions to a system that requires sellers to check with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether buyers have criminal records, are charged with crimes or have mental health conditions that would bar them from owning a gun. Any changes to gun rules in America are fraught with political risk. The U.S. Constitution's 2nd Amendment gives Americans the right to have arms, a right that is fiercely defended. The stocks of gunmakers Smith & Wesson Holding Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co Inc have climbed since the announcement. On Tuesday morning, Smith & Wesson jumped was up 10 percent to $25.58 a share and Sturm Ruger was up more than 6 percent at $65.46. Legal challenges to the changes are expected and Republican presidential candidates have promised to reverse his order if they win the White House. But Obama, entering his eighth and last year in office, has said his measures are within his authority and consistent with the Constitution.

457,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/RpPQK5FBXTI/,"A Sandy Hook ""truther"" will face a jury after a Connecticut judge rejected his request for a special probation program for allegedly -- and repeatedly -- harassing a slain teacher's family. Matthew Mills confronted the sister of Victoria Soto after a Nov. 7 charity race held in her honor and recorded video of the woman's reaction, reported the News Times. Soto was hailed as a hero after investigators said she protected her first-grade students from a gunman during the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The 32-year-old Mills was charged with breach of peace and interfering with police after investigators say he shoved a photo of Soto into her younger sister's face and angrily shouted that she had never existed and the mass shooting had not taken place. Jillian Soto was upset by the accusations and repeatedly asked Mills to leave her alone, but instead he continued shouting at her and recording video of her crying until police arrived. Mills then ran away, police said, but he was arrested a short time later following a brief foot chase. His attorney argued during a hearing Thursday that Mills was exercising his constitutional right to free speech by denying the slain woman's existence to her relatives. “Sometimes facts are misinterpreted and police reports are not as factual as they should be,” argued attorney James Hardy II. The attorney asked the judge to place Mills in an accelerated rehabilitation program for non-violent offenders, which would have allowed him to plead guilty and be placed on two years of probation. The original charges would then be dismissed if Mills didn't commit any additional crimes while on probation. The attorney said the Brooklyn man's wife is expecting a child and had given her husband an ultimatum to stop promoting conspiracy theories. Jillian Soto begged the court not to grant the request, saying Mills had repeatedly harassed her family. Prosecutors said Mills was likely to commit additional crimes while on probation, saying that he had interrupted a postgame interview at Super Bowl 48 to shout 9/11 conspiracy theories. Superior Court Judge William Holden denied the request by Mills, who will face a jury trial. “I’m of the opinion that any crime that threatens someone’s liberty is serious,” the judge said. “No one, Mr. Mills, is limiting your passion to do what you desire, but this request is denied.” He's expected to argue during the trial that the mass shooting was staged by the government and that Victoria Soto never existed. Mills defended his actions shortly after his arrest, saying he asked Jillian Soto whether a family photo showing older sister was real or altered by Photoshop. “I went to the race to specifically talk to her, but I waited until the end, and I donated also,” Mills told the New York Daily News. “They’re making me out to be a bad guy. I just asked one question.” Down the rabbit hole of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories, some ""truthers"" consider Mills to be a possible government agent intended to discredit them and their movement. Watch Mills interrupt the Super Bowl postgame interview:  MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell speculated this week that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will resign on the morning of August 13. Lindell told Real America's Voice host Steve Bannon that he came to this conclusion after speaking with three Democrats who regretted voting for Biden.

Four of the schools were soon given the all clear but searches were still underway at five others, the spokesman said. He said he could not confirm a media report that one of the schools had also been threatened with a mass shooting. The threats - which may have been automated because they were so similar - were dialed in at about 8:50 a.m. to high schools in Teaneck, Garfield, Tenafly, Clifton, Fair Lawn, Leonia, Bergenfield, Englewood and Hackensack, said said sheriff spokesman Anthony Cureton. ""Four of the nine have been cleared. Dogs came in and did the sweep,"" Cureton said. He declined to say which of the schools had been cleared of the threat.

460,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/working-families-party/422949/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss,"The Working Families Party has pushed the political debate to the left in the states where it’s already active. Now—in the era of Occupy and Bernie Sanders—it’s ready to take that fight nationwide. At a recent private dinner in Manhattan, a small group of leftists plotted to take over America. The group, a dozen community organizers and activists from all over the country, had convened at a sushi restaurant in the Flatiron District with the leaders of the New York-based Working Families Party. They were heads of organizations from Boston to Albuquerque, with names like National People’s Action and Washington Community Action Network. And they were there to hear why their states should form their own chapters of the insurgent party, in order to capitalize on the country’s rising liberal tide and push the national conversation leftward. The party’s deputy director, Jon Green, a pale, bespectacled 42-year-old, made the pitch. “In 2010, we saw the Tea Party yank the entire political discourse way to the right,” he said. The Tea Party was powerful, he said, because it was boldly ideological; it recruited and groomed candidates; and it created a strong national brand. “Our view is that there isn’t anything analogous to that on the left, and there ought to be.” Heads nodded around the table. The Working Families Party’s agenda—frankly redistributionist and devoted to social equality—targets a class of Democratic elected officials who, in the view of many liberals, seem to listen more to their moneyed donors than to the left-wing rank and file. Aggressive, tactical, and dedicated to winning, the WFP would like to force Democrats—and the country—to become more liberal by mobilizing the party base, changing the terms of the debate, and taking out centrist incumbents in primaries. If there’s ever been a moment for this, it is now. Four years after Occupy Wall Street, with the socialist Bernie Sanders pushing Hillary Clinton leftward in the Democratic presidential primaries, liberal frustration with national politics has reached a boiling point. Enter the WFP: Since its founding nearly two decades ago, it’s become an influential fixture of Democratic politics in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Now, the party is going national. By mid-2016, the WFP plans to be in 11 states, with more on the horizon. Last month, the WFP endorsed Sanders after an online vote of its national membership. They may not yet be a household name, but a few years from now, they aim to be a national force. Many of the activists in the dining room that night were there because they thought their states’ liberals needed more edge. Javier Benavidez is the executive director of the Albuquerque-based South West Organizing Project, a community group that will help to launch the New Mexico Working Families Party later this year. In New Mexico, Benavidez said, labor and community groups had a good relationship. “But when it came to taking on corporate Democrats, there was a lot of hesitation.” Analilia Mejia, the crusading director of New Jersey Working Families, jumped in from across the table. “Here is what you say to them, verbatim: ‘Let us be the “crazy” left,’” she said. “‘Let us be the voice that creates the space that allows you to negotiate for more of what you want.’ You can’t be for raising taxes? Let us say, ‘Tax the rich,’ and then you can push harder.” From Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, to the Black Lives Matter movement and recent social-justice protests on college campuses, the activist left is enjoying a prominence not seen since the 1970s. The largest proportion of Americans now identify as “liberal” since Gallup began asking the question in 1992. As both cause and symptom of this moment, the WFP represents a sign of things to come for a Democratic Party still in the early stages of wrestling over what form it will take in the post-Obama era. Without the WFP, de Blasio, who may be the most powerful progressive in the country, would not likely be mayor. The party’s Chicago partner helped to force Mayor Rahm Emanuel into Chicago’s first-ever mayoral runoff as he sought reelection last year. It played a key role in increasing the number of blacks on the six-member Ferguson, Missouri, city council from one to three in the wake of that city’s police-brutality protests. WFP-supported candidates have defeated incumbent Democrats in legislative primaries in Connecticut, New York, and Oregon, and party-supported candidates serve on city councils from Hartford to Chicago. The party has been instrumental in pushing issues such as government-mandated paid sick leave and a $15 minimum wage to the forefront of the national Democratic agenda. As dinner wound down, the group traded war stories about disloyal Democrats and local fights. Charly Carter, the director of Maryland Working Families, complained that some elected officials seemed to lose the fire in the belly once they took office. “It can be a real letdown,” Carter said. “We are at war. And when you’re at war, you don’t need statesmen—you need gladiators. We elect them to be gladiators, and once they get there they want to be statesmen.” Her tablemates nodded in sympathy. The implication was clear: Their mission was to ensure that Democrats couldn’t get away with selling out their base. The Working Families Party’s bid for national prominence might seem like a long shot. But the party has succeeded in racking up electoral and policy victories in the places where it has long been active, starting with New York. In the Empire State, where it was founded, the WFP is undeniably influential. It’s a force in city politics, but also makes its presence felt in the state legislature. It arose as a result of the state’s unusual fusion-voting system, in which candidates can run on the ballot lines of multiple parties—so, for example, a voter for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg would find him listed on the ballot twice, as the Republican candidate and as the candidate of the Independence Party. The fusion system allows third parties to exert influence on the two established parties, offering them the chance to support major-party candidates rather than playing spoiler. The system has given minor parties an unusual role in New York politics, but while the Conservative Party has generally lived up to its name, the Liberal Party has not: In 1989, it endorsed Republican Rudy Giuliani. The betrayal outraged then-governor Mario Cuomo and prompted a revolt among a group of liberal union leaders and community activists. They formed the New Party in 1990; after some fits and starts, it became the Working Families Party in 1998. The party is controlled and funded by a board consisting of labor unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, and grassroots groups such as Moveon.org; its national president, a garrulous visionary named Dan Cantor, has a résumé that includes the Jesse Jackson presidential campaign and the now-defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN. Success for the nascent WFP came faster than its founders could have dreamed: In the 1998 election, the party’s endorsed gubernatorial candidate, the Democrat Peter Vallone, received more than 50,000 votes on the WFP line (despite losing the race), guaranteeing the party ballot access going forward. It immediately started scoring policy victories: the state’s first county-level living-wage ordinances; a statewide hike in the minimum wage passed over the veto of a Republican governor in 2004; and the first major reforms to the Rockefeller drug laws, set in motion by a WFP-backed African American candidate’s primary defeat of a conservative Democratic district attorney in Albany. In 2003, Letitia James won election to the New York City Council on the WFP line alone, beating the Democratic candidate in the race and becoming the council’s first minor-party representative in 30 years. That planted the seeds of the WFP’s plan to take over the council. By 2009, the party had helped seven challengers win city-council primaries, many of them defeating Democratic incumbents, and backed a progressive councilman named Bill de Blasio’s upset bid for the citywide office of public advocate. Once in office, the WFP-backed council members joined with liberals already on the council to form an 11-member Progressive Caucus which, despite being a minority on the 51-seat council, quickly proved capable of driving the agenda—and tormenting then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Christine Quinn, the city council’s speaker at the time, sided against the WFP on issues like paid sick leave, ending stop-and-frisk, and extending term limits; once seen as Bloomberg’s inevitable successor, Quinn was routed in the 2013 Democratic primary. Today, de Blasio is the mayor of New York, James is the public advocate, the Progressive Caucus numbers 18 members, and the speaker is a former caucus chair named Melissa Mark-Viverito. In short, America’s largest city has gone from being run by a billionaire mayor and a party-machine council to being steered by a progressive mayor and progressive-driven council. In place of debates between Republicans and timid, triangulating Democrats, the fight in New York is now largely between moderates and activists on the left. (Even de Blasio now finds himself to the right of the progressives on the council, particularly on criminal-justice issues.) This is what WFP would like to accomplish nationally—on city councils and county boards, in stage legislatures, and in Congress. “Here’s what I’d say is the bottom line about the Working Families Party,” Patrick Gaspard, the former White House director of political affairs who now serves as the Ambassador to South Africa, told me. As a young New York activist, Gaspard was a founding board member of the WFP. “They have values, they have high capacity for a relatively small organization, and unlike many on the left, they have a habit of winning.” (Gaspard stressed that he was speaking in his personal capacity and not in his current professional role.) The party relies on traditional labor- and community-organizing techniques. It maintains an army of paid canvassers year-round who can quickly mobilize voters for elections or initiatives. And it recruits and trains candidates at the ground level, seeding low-level local offices with sympathizers. In October, in a conference room on an upper floor of a Manhattan skyscraper, I watched a legal assistant named Francena Amparo dial for dollars in her reelection race to the Duchess County Legislature, the 25-person board that governs a Hudson Valley county more than an hour north of the city. “Hi, Wilbur, are you there?” said Amparo, a Bronx-accented 38-year-old with flowing hair and a gap-toothed smile. “It’s Francena, the county legislator from Duchess County. How are you doing?” Amparo had set aside two hours from her workday for fundraising calls—to family, friends, and even her doctor. She worked from a script—“I’m calling because I’m running for reelection and I need a boost in the home stretch”—and generally asked for $50 or $75. If she got a “yes,” she handed the phone to one of the two hipsterish young African American WFP staffers in the room, who took credit-card information and added the donation to a spreadsheet. The most important point in the script, highlighted and underlined and all-caps, was to stop talking once you make the ask—when you wait for the other person to fill the silence, they usually say yes. Amparo’s total fundraising goal was just $7,500, and fewer than 2,000 votes would be cast in the election in November, where she was running as both a Democrat and a Working Families candidate, listed on both ballot lines. The theory behind helping people like Amparo—a working-class, lesbian Latina who never saw herself as a potential officeholder until the WFP came calling—is that when seats open up for state legislature or Congress, it’s these lesser officeholders that the Democratic Party will draw upon. (Many New York politicos say the WFP is more organized and effective than the state Democratic Party, and Democratic candidates routinely draw on WFP staff for their campaigns.) In the municipal elections across New York State in November, 71 of the WFP’s 111 downballot candidates won—including Amparo, who beat her Republican challenger by just 21 votes. But the WFP’s story in New York is more complicated than this simple narrative of triumph. It has had a harder time outside New York City, particularly when it comes to the centrist Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, a skilled tactician who has repeatedly outmaneuvered the left. Fiscally conservative but socially liberal, Cuomo epitomizes the sort of “corporate Democrat” the WFP despises. In his 2010 gubernatorial election, he threatened to refuse to run on the party’s ballot line—a move that would have killed the party’s ballot access—unless the party’s leaders promised not to challenge his first budget. The WFP had no choice but to agree, and it was “incredibly disheartening” to the party’s leaders and supporters to stand by in silence as Cuomo successfully passed a package of tax cuts for corporations and the rich, one former WFP staffer told me. (A party spokesman didn’t dispute that the WFP gave Cuomo a pass on his first budget, but noted that the party successfully fought him later in the year on the expiration of a tax on high earners.) In 2014, when Cuomo stood for reelection, the party had recruited a candidate to challenge him in the Democratic primary—a law professor and Occupy Wall Street leader named Zephyr Teachout. But when it came time for the WFP to make an endorsement and bestow its ballot line, the party was badly divided. Its old ally de Blasio, now the city’s mayor (and, at the time, trying to curry favor with Cuomo to get his own agenda through the legislature), brokered a deal whereby Cuomo would get the WFP endorsement in exchange for a series of promises, such as campaigning for Democratic state-senate candidates and backing ethics and campaign-finance reforms. (Teachout nonetheless won a third of the primary vote, testament to the level of Democratic dissatisfaction with Cuomo.) Cuomo took the deal. But once he got the endorsement, he brazenly reneged, flouting his former promises and even seeking to undermine the WFP by starting a new ballot line called the Women’s Equality Party to confuse voters. In retrospect, WFP insiders view the Cuomo endorsement as a damaging miscalculation. But they take some encouragement from more recent developments: In a deviation from his usual fiscal conservatism, the governor recently came out in favor of a statewide $15 minimum wage. Coming from a pol seen as motivated purely by self-interest, Cuomo’s move was a sign this liberal cause had become a political winner. It is an irony of the Obama era that, despite having a liberal Democrat in the White House, liberals often feel irrelevant to the national political debate. As Analilia Mejia piloted her gray SUV down a New Jersey highway, she considered the question of what ideas are considered politically reasonable. There had just been another mass shooting, at a community college in Oregon, and the president had once again made a speech saying the gun situation was out of hand. On the radio, people were calling in to say that some things that might actually help—taking away people’s handguns, requiring them to register with the government—were obviously ridiculous, out of the question. But why? That’s what Mejia, the director of New Jersey Working Families, wanted to know. A longtime union organizer who actually postponed her wedding to work on the Obama campaign, Mejia had previously served as New Jersey political director of the powerful mid-Atlantic janitors’ union, SEIU 32BJ, whose 145,000 members can be found everywhere from Yankee Stadium to the Pentagon. The daughter of a Colombian garment worker and a Dominican laborer, Mejia, along with her younger sister, spent several early-childhood years with relatives in Venezuela after their father injured his back and could no longer support the family. “It was better to live on poverty-level wages in a shantytown in Venezuela than on a garment-worker’s salary in Elizabeth, New Jersey,” she told me as we inched forward in traffic. “That’s crazypants.” Union work was satisfying but limiting for Mejia. Given the dramatic contraction of the labor movement, which has fallen to just 7 percent of private sector workers (in 1984, it was 16 percent), she longed to improve the lives of all workers, not just those lucky enough to be in a union. (In this sense, the WFP represents a stab at an American labor party, a common feature of European democracies that the U.S. has historically lacked.) The WFP gives activists like Mejia an outlet for their frustration with national politics. It channels their anger at the constricting terms of the national debate into ground-level organizing—where the politics may seem unglamorously small-time, but there’s a chance to make a difference in people’s lives. “We’ve found ways of electoralizing our issues,” Mejia told me. “We make politicians walk the walk—and pay the price if they don’t.” The idea is to make Democratic politicians more accountable to their liberal base through the asymmetric warfare party primaries enable, much as the conservative movement has done to Republicans. “The rules are rigged against working people, so we have to think outside the box to find different ways to win at this game,” Mejia said. When the Democratic-controlled New Jersey Legislature wasn’t advancing a statewide paid-sick-leave bill, the WFP went to the municipal level to find a workaround; 10 New Jersey cities have now mandated paid sick leave. And when Governor Chris Christie vetoed a set of voting reforms—including automatic voter registration and restoring felons’ voting rights—the party set out to collect signatures to put it on the ballot instead, hoping to put the issue before voters in November 2016. Mejia has also spearheaded the party’s role as Christie’s chief harasser—a task the state’s sclerotic, Christie-co-opted Democratic Party originally hesitated to take up. The WFP’s protests, ethics complaints, and calls for Christie’s resignation helped put the Bridgegate scandal on the map, severely wounding the presidential hopes of the man once considered a top 2016 GOP contender. The party also worked to elect Ras Baraka, an opponent of education reform, to succeed Cory Booker as mayor of Newark over a better-funded candidate. (WFP-style liberals generally side with teachers’ unions in viewing education reform, which the Obama administration and many Democrats have championed, as a corporatist plot to undermine public education.) Arriving in West Orange, Mejia pulled up to the venue for the evening’s New Jersey Working Families gala, a banquet hall with a strong Jersey vibe: mirrors, marble, patterned carpet. Bumper stickers reading “Kicking Ass for the Working Class” were available at the check-in table. The evening’s speakers included Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, a liberal New Jersey lawmaker the WFP has championed since she was in the state assembly, and Representative Keith Ellison, the Minnesotan who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. One testament to the party’s growing local clout was that attendees included the chair of the New Jersey Democratic Party, John Currie, and the mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop, whom many local observers expect to be a top Democratic prospect for governor when Christie leaves office in 2017. Just as even mainstream Republican politicians now feel obliged to kowtow to the Tea Party, the WFP, in the states where it is strongest, has begun to bend the Democratic establishment in its direction. “There has been a changing of the guard,” Currie, the chairman, told me. “Many more of our elected officials are very progressive now.” Fulop, whose city was the first in New Jersey and the sixth in the country to adopt paid sick leave, told me the WFP represented the first “collective voice for the middle class” that New Jersey had seen in his memory. Until the party came along, he said, Christie had largely succeeded in a strategy of “divide and conquer” to “get Democrats to give up on our core values in the name of compromise,” such as by agreeing to pension reform. Though he declined to tell me whether he was running for governor, it was clear that he saw cozying up to the WFP as the best way to signal his progressive allegiances in a potential Democratic primary. “The Working Families Party provides a balance,” he said. “That was missing, very much so.” Why would the left want a Tea Party? Mainstream Democrats and Republicans alike tend to see the right-wing movement as a pernicious force that has gridlocked national politics, simultaneously stymieing the president and hurting the GOP’s image. But to the leaders of the WFP, the right-wing movement’s sudden rise was a revelation. “I watched the Tea Party achieve our goal in reverse,” Dan Cantor, the WFP’s national director, told me one day in his New York office. “They were able to pull the country hard to the right without a single ballot line.” The Tea Party showed that you could be a political party-type actor while still operating mainly within the two-party system, through primary challenges and activism. It convinced Cantor that the WFP’s incremental, fusion-based strategy was too limited, and that there were other ways to wring ideological purity from a party that was in the habit of selling out its most loyal supporters. Then, in late 2011, the Occupy Wall Street protest movement erupted across the country. This was another eye-opening jolt for Cantor: “It raised the possibility of a new progressive moment,” he said. The energy, he saw, was there to be tapped—it just needed organizers who knew how to channel it. Organizers, perhaps, like the WFP. The WFP, Cantor explained, doesn’t expect to overthrow the two-party system—nor does it want to be a hopeless cause like the Greens or the Libertarian Party. “Every good idea in American history started with a third party: abolition, the eight-hour day, women’s suffrage, child-labor laws, unemployment insurance, Social Security,” he said. “These didn’t start with the Democratic or Republican Party—they started with the Free Soilers and the Liberty Party and the Populist Party and the Socialist Party. That’s where these things germinate, and then when you do well, they get adopted by one of the major parties, or in very rare cases the major party collapses. “So we’re not naïve,” he continued. “The Democratic Party is not about to collapse. But we think there’s a huge number of people inside the Democratic Party that actually agree with us, and we want the Democratic Party to be feistier, tougher, and more focused on the needs of ordinary people, not the preferences of their donors.” It was in this spirit that the WFP made its presidential endorsement, of Sanders, in December. It was a move that had even some WFP allies scratching their heads: Why align themselves with a presidential candidate who is likely to lose, prompting questions about the WFP’s clout and potentially alienating Hillary Clinton, who has tacked to the left in ways that satisfy many progressives? Clinton has also been endorsed by some of the WFP’s stakeholder unions, putting them in a difficult position. The WFP risked coming across as the Bernie Sanders of political organizations: loud and angry, but ultimately a sideshow. The WFP’s stated goal is to help Sanders win. It decided to back Sanders after a vote by its governing board and an online survey of rank-and-file members, 87 percent of whom chose Sanders. But internally, party members see an upside to the endorsement even if he doesn’t prevail. It’s about expanding the party by tapping the energy Sanders has roused—and giving those new activists somewhere to go once the Sanders campaign has ended. In 2013, the WFP was active in just four states—New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Oregon. Since then, it has opened chapters in Washington, D.C., Maryland, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Rhode Island, with New Mexico expected to join this year. “We wait for people to call us,” Green, the deputy director, who is spearheading the national expansion, told me with a laugh. Usually, they’re people who feel abandoned by their local Democrats. “They’re organizations that used to feel like they had power, mostly labor unions,” Green said. “Public-sector unions used to feel like the Democratic Party had their back. Maybe that wasn’t ever really true, but they’re certainly seeing it’s not true now. And low-income communities that once felt that the Democratic Party was the logical place for them to situate their politics—they see the Democratic Party drifting ever rightward, and being fine with the oppression of black people.” Green has firsthand experience with this process. In 2003, he was the director of the newly formed Connecticut WFP, the party’s first foray outside New York, when leaders of the Democratic-controlled state legislature teamed up with Republican Governor John Rowland on a budget that resulted in layoffs for 2,300 unionized state workers. For the state employees’ union, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, “it was an awakening,” Green told me. It was one thing for the Republican governor to float such a proposal, but the unions had counted on the Democrats to block him. “They felt like, ‘These are the people that have our back. They’re Democrats—they’re going to be there for us.’ And they weren’t.” Elsewhere in the country, the Tea Party is a model for what the WFP is trying to do. But in Connecticut, the WFP predates the Tea Party—and its clout is such that in 2010, when the Tea Party was rising nationally, a Connecticut Tea Party affiliate cited the WFP as an inspiration. The current majority leader of the state House launched his career with WFP backing. In 2009, in the wake of the financial crisis, New York and Connecticut were two of the only states to fill their state budget holes by raising taxes on the rich rather than merely cutting spending. In Connecticut’s 2010 Democratic gubernatorial primary, an underdog mayor named Dan Malloy attacked the front-runner, Ned Lamont, for his opposition to paid sick days, making it the subject of a blitz of TV ads. Lamont, formerly a liberal darling for his 2006 primary defeat of Senator Joe Lieberman, led in the polls right up to the eve of the primary—but Malloy ended up beating him by 14 points. Paid sick days had been proposed but blocked by the Democratic legislature in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Once Malloy took office in 2011, he quickly signed the nation’s first statewide paid-sick-days mandate. There's Something About Bernie These days, Green gets a lot of calls from frustrated liberals looking for a way to pressure the Democratic Party from the left. In Wisconsin, the newly formed WFP wants to oust the Milwaukee County executive, Chris Abele, a wealthy businessman and ostensible Democrat who opposes tax hikes and supports privatizing government services. In Baltimore, the party is training candidates to take on city-council incumbents; in D.C., it is working to put a $15 minimum wage on the ballot. In Chicago, the same election that forced Emanuel into a runoff saw the council’s progressive caucus increase from seven to 11 members. Now, Emanuel faces mass protests and a recall threat for his handling of police violence in the city. The WFP has also succeeded in pushing its pet issues to the forefront of the Democratic agenda. One signature cause is government-mandated paid sick leave, a once-fringe idea that in the past year was mentioned in President Obama’s State of the Union address, presented as a centerpiece of Hillary Clinton’s economic agenda, and championed by Nancy Pelosi. Similarly, the party was an early champion of the $15 minimum wage, once considered unthinkable but now a reality in several large cities. Is all this enough to deserve the “Tea Party of the left” label? That may be premature. Democratic divisions have yet to develop into the sort of government-shuttering national drama of the GOP’s fractures, and the party’s presidential primary has turned into a tedious coronation. The WFP’s victories to date have been numerous but small-bore—a far cry from the Tea Party’s attention-getting mass rallies and defeats of veteran U.S. senators. But the WFP would argue that, with Congress gridlocked and in Republican hands, more effective policymaking happens at the state and local level. The WFP’s focus on municipal office also represents an attempt to leverage Democrats’ concentration in urban areas. Like the Tea Party, the WFP bedevils mainstream Democrats. One Democratic elected official in a jurisdiction where the party is active lamented that its absolutist demands sometimes make governing impossible: “They’re bomb throwers.” But the Tea Party and WFP alike view the traditional mode of bipartisan governance as a corrupt bargain. Making that harder is the whole point. In mid-November, WFP staffers from across the country gathered for their first-ever national gala. Held in a dimly lit foyer of the national AFL-CIO headquarters, two blocks from the White House, the event featured a modest bar and forlorn-looking cheese tray. To one side, an imposing, 1950s-era, gilt-heavy mural of heroic laborers with a motto from Virgil (“Labor Omnia Vincit”); to the other, a canvas banner color-printed with WFP activists, carrying signs like “The Seas Are Rising & So Are We,” “Hands Up Don’t Shoot,” and “I Am a Woman.” A plaque identified the venue as the Samuel Gompers Room. Heather McGhee, the president of the leftist think tank Demos, kicked off the proceedings. “You ain’t seen nothing yet from the Working Families Party,” she said. “We’re electing leaders, we’re winning on issues, and most importantly, we’re changing what’s politically possible.” McGhee, a black woman with long light-brown dreadlocks, ticked off the party’s victories, starting with minimum-wage hikes and paid sick days. “We took down the Rockefeller drug laws, we won police body cameras, and we helped stop the abuse of stop-and-frisk,” she said. “We stood up to the hedge funders who look at our schools and see dollar signs, from Bridgeport to Newark, from Philadelphia to Chicago. “We’ve been working day in and day out to win on these issues and change the debate,” she added. “And this here, tonight, what you’re at, is our coming-out party. Because we are the people who believe that our economy should be measured in the health, happiness, and security of our families, not in corporate profits. We are the people who believe that democracy is for the people, not the super PACs. We are the people who know that economic inequality in America has always been built on the scaffolding of racial injustice.” At this, there was applause and shouts of “Amen!” “We are the people who believe that the future of our planet is worth more than the profits of oil and coal executives,” she added. “And you know what? We deserve a political party, too.” A few minutes later, a slender, elegant, dark-skinned woman in a black silk gown took the stage. She was Diana Richardson, a member of the New York State Assembly from Crown Heights, Brooklyn; in a May special election, she became the first-ever New York state legislator elected solely on the WFP ballot line. Her campaign hinged on railing against gentrification and the “greedy developers” leaving the neighborhood’s historic residents behind. Speaking in a Brooklyn accent of Rosie-Perez-in-White-Men-Can’t-Jump proportions, Richardson proclaimed, “The local Democrats didn’t want someone like me. Listen to my voice—it’s very strong! You can’t push me around.” The audience laughed and cheered. “But another party did want me,” she added. “The Working Families Party.” Richardson exuded a powerful charisma—it was clear why her constituents had seen her as a champion, even if it was also clear why she wouldn't necessarily fit a major-party mold. If the Working Families Party gets its way, the future of the American left will look a lot less like Hillary Clinton—and a lot more like Diana Richardson.",2016-01-15 00:00:00,The Tea Party of the Left,"politics and government,united states politics and government",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

462,https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-milwaukee-temple-attack-20160126-story.html,"MILWAUKEE — Samy Mohamed Hamzeh, 23, had a plan, the Justice Department said: Kill more than two dozen people at a Masonic temple in Milwaukee and become an international jihadist superstar. ""I am telling you, if this hit is executed, it will be known all over the world,"" Hamzeh told two unnamed FBI sources in Arabic. ""All over the world, all the mujahedeen will be talking and they will be proud of us. ... We are marching at the front of the war."" The larger the number of victims, the better, Hamzeh said. But 30 sounded about right. ""Thirty is excellent,"" he allegedly said. ""If I got out, after killing 30 people, I will be happy 100 percent ... 100 percent happy, because these 30 will terrify the world."" Now, Hamzeh's alleged plans have been derailed. He was arrested Tuesday and charged with possessing machine guns and a silencer, as the DOJ announced. ""Samy Mohamed Hamzeh devised a detailed plan to commit a mass shooting intended to kill dozens of people,"" Acting United States Attorney Gregory J. Haanstad said in a statement. ""He also said that he wanted this mass shooting to be 'known the world over' and to 'ignite' broader clashes. It is difficult to calculate the injury and loss of life that was prevented by concerned citizens coming forward and by the tireless efforts of the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force."" Arrested after reportedly purchasing weapons from two undercover FBI agents, Hamzeh's plans were detailed indeed, prosecutors said. Though he originally intended to attack Israeli soldiers and civilians in the West Bank, he settled on the Freemasons' lodge, and discussed the need for high-powered weaponry at length. ""We want two machine guns,"" Hamzeh, who was placed under surveillance in October, told the FBI's sources. ""You now have one, so we want two more, and we need three silencers, that's it. Find out how much all together these will cost, and then we will march."" According to the DOJ, he had plotted the whole attack out, down to where he thought his conspirators would stand at the temple. ""One of us will stay at the door at the entrance and lock the door down, he will be at the main door down, two will get to the lift up, they will enter the room, and spray everyone in the room,"" he allegedly said. ""The one who is standing downstairs will spray anyone he finds. We will shoot them, kill them and get out."" Hamzeh also allegedly had an escape plan. ""We will walk and walk, after a while, we will be covered as if it is cold, and we'll take the covers off and dump them in a corner and keep on walking, as if nothing happened, as if everything is normal,"" he said, according to prosecutors. ""But one has to stand on the door, because if no one stood at the door, people will be going in and out, if people came in from outside and found out what is going on, everything is busted."" Though a Freemasons' lodge was targeted in Istanbul in 2004, Hamzeh's purported choice of target appeared to be novel. Freemasons, or Masons, have been in America since before the founding of the United States. There were an estimated 1.5 million Masons in the country in 2009; Wisconsin now has 11,000, according to the Associated Press. George Washington was a Mason; so were both Presidents Roosevelt and John Wayne. Masonic symbols appear on our currency, and they influenced the design of Washington, D.C. Many conspiracies have been attributed to the group's allegedly insidious aims, and entire political parties have been devoted to reducing their influence in politics. ""The Freemasons were the first, the biggest, and the best-known gentlemen's organization in the world,"" Christopher Hodapp wrote in ""Freemasons for Dummies."" ""Up until about 1960, if you weren't a Mason, you at least knew what one was. As secret societies go, they were a pretty badly hidden one."" Hamzeh allegedly took the view that Masons, though now known primarily for their charity work, deserved to die. The DOJ said he toured the lodge in Milwaukee with the two people he thought were his co-conspirators. ""They are all Masonic; they are playing with the world like a game, man, and we are like asses, we don't know what is going on,"" Hamzeh allegedly said. ""These are the ones who are fighting, these are the ones that needs to be killed, not the Shi'iat, because these are the ones who are against us, these are the ones who are making living for us like hell."" ""Masons are a part of an organization that helped build this country,"" Frank Struble, the grand master of Free and Accepted Masons in Wisconsin, said. ""I can understand from that standpoint where someone who is against this country would target us."" A physical trainer who recently lost his job at a local gym, Hamzeh was not known for his gift of gab -- and was fired for being ""too intense,"" according to the AP. ""He wasn't very conversational,"" Kiela Hoeldel, a former client, told WTMJ.
